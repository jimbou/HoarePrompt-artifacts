Output State: **n is an integer and is greater than i, l is a list of n integers, i is increased by 1, j is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the element of l at index p-1 is equal to i + 1, p is the element of l at index i, q is the element of l at index p-1, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer greater than `i`. The list `l` also remains unchanged with `n` integers. The value of `i` is increased by 1. The value of `j` is either 0 or 1, depending on whether the element of `l` at index `p-1` is equal to `i + 1`. The value of `p` is the element of `l` at index `i`, and the value of `q` is the element of `l` at index `p-1`. The number of test cases in stdin remains `t-1`.
