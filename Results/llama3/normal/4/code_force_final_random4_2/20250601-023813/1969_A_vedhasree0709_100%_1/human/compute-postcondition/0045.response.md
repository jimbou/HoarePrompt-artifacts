Output State: **`n` is an integer and is greater than `i`, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is 1 if the element of `l` at index `p-1` is equal to `i + 1`, otherwise `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the element of `l` at index `p-1` is equal to `i + 1`, `p` is the element of `l` at index `i`, `q` is the element of `l` at index `p-1`, stdin contains `t-1` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `l` still contains `n` integers, and `n` is still greater than `i`. The value of `j` depends on whether the element of `l` at index `p-1` is equal to `i + 1`. The values of `p` and `q` are still the elements of `l` at indices `i` and `p-1`, respectively. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases.
