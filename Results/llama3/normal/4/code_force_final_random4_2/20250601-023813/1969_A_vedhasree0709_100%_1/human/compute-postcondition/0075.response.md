According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is greater than 0. `i` being less than or equal to `n` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is less than `n`, `p` is the (`i-1`)th element of `l`, `q` is the (`p-1`)th element of `l`, `j` is either 1 or unchanged, stdin contains `t-1` test cases.**
