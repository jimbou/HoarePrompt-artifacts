Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to his friends so that at least 2 friends come to the party. The program iterates through each test case, checks for a specific condition (i.e., if there exists a pair of integers p and q such that q is equal to p's index plus one), and prints 2 if the condition is met. If no such pair is found, it prints 3.

The program's logic is correct because it accurately implements the problem's requirements. The condition checked in the while loop is a necessary and sufficient condition for at least 2 friends to come to the party. If such a pair is found, sending invitations to both friends will result in at least 2 friends attending the party, which meets the problem's requirement. If no such pair is found, sending invitations to 3 friends is the minimum required to guarantee that at least 2 friends will attend.

The program's implementation is also correct. It correctly reads the input, iterates through each test case, and prints the minimum number of invitations required. The use of the variable j to track whether a pair has been found is also correct, as it allows the program to print 3 only if no pair is found.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
