To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.

The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is the input from `stdin`, as it is the source of the loop's iteration count.

At the end of the previous iteration, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. For the loop to execute again, `stdin` must contain at least one more test case.

State: **`i` is n, `j` is 0 or 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `p` is the (`n-1`)th element of `l`, `q` is the (`p-1`)th element of `l`, `stdin` contains `t` test cases**
