The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` was less than `n` before the code was executed, so now `i` is either less than `n` or equal to `n`. The other variables are not affected by the code. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases. The value of `p` is the `i`th element of `l` before the code was executed, so now `p` is the `(i-1)`th element of `l`. The value of `q` is the `(i-1)`th element of `l` before the code was executed, so now `q` is the `(i-2)`th element of `l`. The value of `j` is either 1 or unchanged before the code was executed, so now `j` is either 1 or unchanged. If `q` is equal to `i+1` before the code was executed, then `j` is set to 1 and the number 2 is printed. But `q` is not equal to `i+1` before the code was executed, so `j` is not set to 1 and the number 2 is not printed. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is either less than `n` or equal to `n`, `p` is the `(i-1)`th element of `l`, `q` is the `(i-2)`th element of `l`, `j` is either 1 or unchanged, stdin contains `t-1` test cases.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is either less than `n` or equal to `n`, `p` is the `(i-1)`th element of `l`, `q` is the `(i-2)`th element of `l`, `j` is either 1 or unchanged, stdin contains `t-1` test cases.**
