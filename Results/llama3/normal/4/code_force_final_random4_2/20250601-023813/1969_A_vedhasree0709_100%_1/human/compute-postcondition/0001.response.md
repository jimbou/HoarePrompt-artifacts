Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 50, l is a list of n distinct integers, i is 0, j is 0**

The code first reads an integer t from stdin, which represents the number of test cases. Then, for each test case, it reads an integer n, which is the number of distinct integers in the test case, and a list of n distinct integers p_i. The code then initializes two variables, i and j, to 0.

After executing the code, the state of the variables is as follows:

* stdin contains t-1 test cases, since one test case has been read and processed.
* n is an integer between 2 and 50, since it was read from stdin and is within the specified range.
* l is a list of n distinct integers, since it was created by mapping the input integers to a list.
* i is 0, since it was initialized to 0.
* j is 0, since it was initialized to 0.

Note that the values of n and l are specific to the current test case, and will change for each subsequent test case.
