Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1 if the (p-1)th element of list `l` is equal to `i + 1`, otherwise `j` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `p` is the `i`th element of `l`, `q` is the (p-1)th element of `l`, stdin contains `t-1` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of `j`, `n`, `l`, `p`, and `q` remain the same as they were not affected by the code. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases.
