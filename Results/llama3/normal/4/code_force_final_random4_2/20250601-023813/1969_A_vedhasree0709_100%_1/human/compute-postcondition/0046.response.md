The variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer and is greater than `i`, `i` is increased by 1. `n` being greater than `i` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than `i`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer and is greater than `i`, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is 1 if the element of `l` at index `p-1` is equal to `i + 1`, otherwise `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the element of `l` at index `p-1` is equal to `i + 1`, `p` is the element of `l` at index `i`, `q` is the element of `l` at index `p-1`, stdin contains `t-1` test cases**
