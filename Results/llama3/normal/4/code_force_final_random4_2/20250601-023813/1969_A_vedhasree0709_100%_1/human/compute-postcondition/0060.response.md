To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `i <= n - 1`. This condition depends on the values of `i` and `n`.

Right before the loop, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer read from stdin. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0, because if `n` is 0 or negative, the condition `i <= n - 1` will be false, and the loop will not execute.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **n is an integer greater than 0, l is a list of n integers read from stdin, i is 0, j is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases**
