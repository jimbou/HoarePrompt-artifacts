According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1, and `n` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1. `n` being greater than or equal to 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than `i`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer and must be greater than `i`, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is increased by 1, if the element of `l` at index `p-1` is equal to `i + 1`, then `j` is set to 1, stdin contains `t-1` test cases**
