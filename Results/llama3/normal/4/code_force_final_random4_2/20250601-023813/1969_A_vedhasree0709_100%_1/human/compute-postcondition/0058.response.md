To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means the loop will execute as long as there are more inputs to read from `stdin`.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer
- `l` is a list of `n` integers
- `i` is equal to `n`
- `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the element of `l` at index `p-1` is equal to `i + 1` at any point during the loop execution
- `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases

For the loop to execute again, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is the input from `stdin`. Since `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `stdin` must contain at least `t` test cases.

State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is either 0 or 1, stdin contains `t` test cases**
