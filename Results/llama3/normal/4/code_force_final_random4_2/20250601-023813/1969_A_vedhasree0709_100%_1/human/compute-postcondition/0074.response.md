Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, `p` is the (`i-1`)th element of `l`, `q` is the (`p-1`)th element of `l`, `j` is either 1 or unchanged, stdin contains `t-1` test cases. If `q` is equal to `i`, then `j` is 1 and the number 2 is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the values of `p` and `q` have been updated accordingly. The value of `j` remains unchanged unless `q` is equal to `i`, in which case `j` is 1 and the number 2 is being printed. The other variables, `n`, `l`, and stdin, remain unchanged.
