Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 50, l is a list of n distinct integers, i is 0, j is 0
Code of the loop:
while i <= n - 1:
    p = l[i]
    q = l[p - 1]
    if q == i + 1:
        print(2)
        j = 1
        break
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `j` is 1 if the (p-1)th element of list `l` is equal to `i + 1`, otherwise `j` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `p` is the `i`th element of `l`, `q` is the (p-1)th element of `l`, stdin contains `t-1` test cases.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is 2, `j` is 1 if the (p-1)th element of list `l` is equal to 2, otherwise `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `p` is the 2nd element of `l`, `q` is the (p-1)th element of `l`, stdin contains t-1 test cases.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is 3, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `p` is the 3rd element of `l`, `q` is the (`p`-1)th element of `l`, stdin contains `t`-1 test cases. If `q` is equal to `i` + 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
