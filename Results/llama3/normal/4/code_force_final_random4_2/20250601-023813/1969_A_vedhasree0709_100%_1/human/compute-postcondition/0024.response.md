Output State: **i is n, j is 1 if the (p-1)th element of list l is equal to i + 1, otherwise j is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 50, l is a list of n distinct integers, p is the (n-1)th element of l, q is the (p-1)th element of l, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: the variable `i` is equal to `n`, the variable `j` is equal to 1 if the (p-1)th element of list `l` is equal to `i + 1`, otherwise `j` is 0, the variable `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, the variable `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers, the variable `p` is the (n-1)th element of `l`, the variable `q` is the (p-1)th element of `l`, and stdin contains `t-1` test cases.
