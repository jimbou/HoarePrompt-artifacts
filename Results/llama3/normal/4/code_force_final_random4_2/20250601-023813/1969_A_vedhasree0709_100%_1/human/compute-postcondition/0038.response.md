Output State: **`n` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is increased by 1, if the element of `l` at index `p-1` is equal to `i + 1`, then `j` is set to 1, stdin contains `t-1` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, but the values of `n`, `l`, and `j` remain unchanged. The condition for `j` being set to 1 is still dependent on the element of `l` at index `p-1` being equal to `i + 1`. The number of test cases in stdin remains `t-1`.
