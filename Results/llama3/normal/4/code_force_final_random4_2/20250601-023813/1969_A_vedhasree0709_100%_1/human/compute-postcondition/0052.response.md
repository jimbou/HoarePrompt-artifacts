Output State: **`n` is an integer and is greater than `i`, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is increased by 1, `p` is the element of `l` at index `i`, `q` is the element of `l` at index `p-1`, stdin contains `t-1` test cases. If the element of `l` at index `p-1` is equal to `i + 1`, then `j` is 1. Otherwise, `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the element of `l` at index `p-1` is equal to `i + 1`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the values of `n`, `l`, `p`, `q`, and `j` remain the same as before. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases. The relationship between `j` and the element of `l` at index `p-1` also remains the same.
