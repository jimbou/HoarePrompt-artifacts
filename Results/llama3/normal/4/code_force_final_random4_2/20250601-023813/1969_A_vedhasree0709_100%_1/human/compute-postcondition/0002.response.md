The only variable in the loop head is variable i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50. `n` being an integer between 2 and 50 ensures that the loop will execute, so it does not need to be adjusted. `i` is 0, which is less than or equal to `n - 1`, so it does not need to be adjusted either. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 50, l is a list of n distinct integers, i is 0, j is 0**
