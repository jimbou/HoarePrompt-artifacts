Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `p` is the 3rd element of `l`, `q` is the (`p`-1)th element of `l`, stdin contains `t`-1 test cases. If `q` is equal to `i` + 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 3. The values of `j`, `n`, `l`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged. The condition regarding `q` being equal to `i` + 1 is still applicable, but since `i` has changed, the condition is now `q` being equal to 4. The stdin still contains `t`-1 test cases.
