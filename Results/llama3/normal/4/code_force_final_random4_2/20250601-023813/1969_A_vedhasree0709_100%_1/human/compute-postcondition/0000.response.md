The only objects in the loop head are variables  _ and input, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input.  If the input is an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n distinct integers p_i (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i). So for the loop to be executed  the input must be an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) and _ is 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n distinct integers p_i (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), _ is 0**
