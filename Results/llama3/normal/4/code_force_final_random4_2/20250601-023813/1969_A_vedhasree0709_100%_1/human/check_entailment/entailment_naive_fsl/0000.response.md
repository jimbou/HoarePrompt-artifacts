Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

4
2 3 4 1

The program will print 3, but the correct answer is 3. However, if the input is:

6
2 3 4 5 6 1

The program will print 3, but the correct answer is 4. The program is not correctly handling cases where there are more than two pairs of friends that can attend the party.

The program is only checking for pairs of friends that can attend the party, but it's not considering the case where there are more than two pairs. In the second example, there are three pairs of friends that can attend the party (1-2, 3-4, and 5-6), but the program is only printing 3, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program needs to be modified to correctly handle cases where there are more than two pairs of friends that can attend the party.
