To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. The loop will execute as long as there is an integer `t` in the input that is greater than 0. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, we don't need to assign a specific value to it. However, we do need to ensure that `stdin` contains at least one integer `t` that is greater than 0.

State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` that is greater than 0**
