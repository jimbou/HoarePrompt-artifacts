Postcondition: ***n is an integer, f is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, k is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is an integer equal to the value of a at index f before sorting, stdin is empty. If the current value of a at index k is greater than the current value of x, 'NO' is printed. If the current value of a at index k is less than x, 'YES' is printed. If the current value of a at index k is equal to x, then 'YES' is printed if k is equal to n-1 or the element at index k+1 in the list a is less than x, otherwise 'MAYBE' is printed.***
