Postcondition: **n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is an integer equal to the value of a at index f, stdin is empty. If a[k] is greater than x, 'NO' is printed. If a[k] is less than x, 'YES' is printed. If a[k] is equal to x, 'YES' is printed if k is equal to n - 2 or the element at index k + 1 of list a is less than the value of x, otherwise 'MAYBE' is printed.**
