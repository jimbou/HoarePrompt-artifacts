Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the result for each case. It takes no parameters and returns no value. For each test case, it reads three integers (n, f, k) and a list of n integers, sorts the list in descending order, and compares the value at index f with the value at index k. Based on the comparison, it prints 'NO' if the value at index k is greater, 'YES' if the value at index k is less, and 'YES' or 'MAYBE' if the values are equal, depending on whether k is the last index or the next value in the list is less than the value at index f.**
