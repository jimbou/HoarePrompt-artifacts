Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 0, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is an integer equal to the value of a at index f, _ is 1. If a[k] is greater than x, 'NO' is printed. If a[k] is less than x, 'YES' is printed. If a[k] is not less than x, then if k is equal to n - 1 or the element at index k + 1 in the list a is less than x, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'MAYBE' is printed.***
