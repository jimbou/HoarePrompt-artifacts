The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable) and the range object created by `range(int(input()))`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range object. If the range object has at least one more iteration, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the range object has been exhausted, so for the loop to execute again, the range object must be recreated with a new input from `stdin`.

State: **`n` is an integer, `f` is an integer equal to its original value, `k` is an integer equal to its original value, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `x` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `f` before sorting, `stdin` is not empty**
