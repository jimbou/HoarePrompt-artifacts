Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed or not. The program sorts the list of cube values in descending order and then compares the value of the favorite cube with the value at the k-th position. If the value at the k-th position is greater than the favorite cube's value, it prints 'NO', indicating that the favorite cube will not be removed. If the value at the k-th position is less than the favorite cube's value, it prints 'YES', indicating that the favorite cube will be removed. If the values are equal, it checks if k is the last index or if the next value in the list is less than the favorite cube's value. If either condition is true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'.

Correctness: **True**
