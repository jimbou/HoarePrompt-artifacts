Output State: **n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is an integer equal to the value of a at index f, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `f`, and `k` are updated to the integer values read from the input. The list `a` is sorted in descending order, and the value of `x` is updated to the value of `a` at index `f`. The stdin is empty after reading the input.
