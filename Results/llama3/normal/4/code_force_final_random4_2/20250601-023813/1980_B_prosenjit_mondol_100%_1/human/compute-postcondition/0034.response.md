Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is an integer equal to the value of a at index f, _ is equal to the initial value of t. If a[k] is greater than x, 'NO' is printed. If a[k] is less than x, 'YES' is printed. If a[k] is not less than x, then if k is equal to n - 1 or the element at index k + 1 in the list a is less than x, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'MAYBE' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of n is an integer greater than or equal to 0.
* The value of f is an integer.
* The value of k is an integer.
* The list a is a sorted list of integers in descending order.
* The value of x is an integer equal to the value of a at index f.
* The value of _ is equal to the initial value of t.
* If the current value of a at index k is greater than the current value of x, 'NO' is printed.
* If the current value of a at index k is less than x, 'YES' is printed.
* If the current value of a at index k is not less than x, then 'YES' is printed if k is equal to n - 1 or the element at index k + 1 in the list a is less than x, otherwise 'MAYBE' is printed.
