The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since the first element of `a` is 0, this element is removed. The rest of the variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with the first element removed (which was 0), `res` is 0, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is undefined**
