Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with at least one element and the first element is not 0, `res` is 0, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is undefined**

The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`, which was initially 0. The list `a` is now non-empty with at least one element, but the first element is no longer 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
