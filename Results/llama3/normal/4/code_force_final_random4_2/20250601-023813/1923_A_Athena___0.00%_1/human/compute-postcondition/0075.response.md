Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed and ends with a zero, `res` is 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is `len(a)-2`, the list `a` is being printed, and the number of zeros in the list `a` which is `res` is being printed.**

In this output state, the list `a` has been modified by removing its last element using the `pop()` method. Since `a` initially ended with a zero, the last element removed is a zero. The value of `i` has been updated to `len(a)-2` to reflect the new length of the list `a`. The other variables `_`, `res`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The list `a` and the number of zeros in the list `a` (`res`) are still being printed.
