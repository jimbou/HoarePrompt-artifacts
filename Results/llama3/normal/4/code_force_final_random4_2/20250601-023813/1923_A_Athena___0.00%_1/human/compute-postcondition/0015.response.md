The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` is 0, this element is removed. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `res` is 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases**
