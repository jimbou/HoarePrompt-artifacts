Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with at least one element and its first element is 0, `res` is 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is `len(a)-1`, the list `a` is being printed, and the number of zeros in the list `a` which is `res` is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 2. The value of `n` remains an integer. The list `a` is still non-empty with at least one element, and its first element is 0. The value of `res` remains 0. The value of `_` remains 2. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains `t-3`. The value of `i` is updated to `len(a)-1`. The list `a` and the number of zeros in the list `a` (which is `res`) are still being printed.
