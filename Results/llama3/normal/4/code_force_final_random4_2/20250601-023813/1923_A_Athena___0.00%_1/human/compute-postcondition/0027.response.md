Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements and all trailing zeros removed, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, the list `a` is printed, `_` is 0. If the second element of `a` is 0, `res` is 3 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` is 2. Otherwise, `res` is 2 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been incremented by 1. If the second element of `a` is 0, `res` is now 3 if the first element of `a` is 0 (because it was 2 before), and 2 otherwise (because it was 1 before). If the second element of `a` is not 0, `res` is now 2 if the first element of `a` is 0 (because it was 1 before), and 1 otherwise (because it was 0 before). All other variables remain unchanged.
