The variables in the loop head are `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is not empty and the first element of `a` is 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with the first element removed (which was 0). So for the loop to be executed one more time, the first element of `a` must be 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with the first element 0, `res` is 0, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is undefined**
