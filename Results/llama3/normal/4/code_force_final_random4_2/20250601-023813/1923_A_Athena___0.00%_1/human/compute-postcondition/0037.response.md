The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. The first element of `a` is 0. After removing the first element, the list `a` will have one less element. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains `t-3` test cases. The variable `i` is still undefined.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with one less element, `res` is 0, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is undefined**
