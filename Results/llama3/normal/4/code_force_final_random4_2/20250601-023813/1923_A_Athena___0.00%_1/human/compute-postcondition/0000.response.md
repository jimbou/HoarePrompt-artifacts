The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` test cases. Since the first input is accepted and assigned to `t`, the stdin now contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) followed by `n` space-separated integers (0 <= a_i <= 1). The value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) followed by `n` space-separated integers (0 <= a_i <= 1).**
