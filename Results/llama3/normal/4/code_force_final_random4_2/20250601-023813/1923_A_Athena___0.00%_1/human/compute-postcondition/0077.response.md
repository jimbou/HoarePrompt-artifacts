Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed, ends with at least one zero, `res` is 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is `len(a)-1`, the list `a` is being printed, and the number of zeros in the list `a` which is `res` is being printed.**

The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since `a` ends with at least two zeros, removing one zero will leave at least one zero at the end. The value of `i` is updated to `len(a)-1` because the length of `a` has decreased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
