Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element and all trailing zeros removed, `res` is 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, the list `a` is printed, `i` is 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is 0.**

The code increments the value of `res` by 1. The initial value of `res` was 0, so after the increment, `res` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
