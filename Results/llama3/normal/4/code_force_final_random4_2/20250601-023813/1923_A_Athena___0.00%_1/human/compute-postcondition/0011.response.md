Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the last element is removed, `res` is 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains the same as it was not affected by the code. The value of `n` also remains the same as it was not affected by the code. The list `a` has at least one element and its last element is removed by the `pop()` function. The value of `res` and `_` remains 0 as they were not affected by the code. The `stdin` still contains `t-1` test cases as the code does not affect the input.
