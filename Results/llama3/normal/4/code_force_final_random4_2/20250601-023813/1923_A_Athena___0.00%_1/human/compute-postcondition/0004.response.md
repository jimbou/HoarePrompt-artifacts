Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers and the first element of `a` is removed, `res` is 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `n` also remains unchanged. The list `a` is modified by removing its first element, which was 0. The values of `res` and `_` remain unchanged as 0. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains `t-1`.
