Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with all trailing zeros removed and has at least 3 elements, `res` is 3 if the first element of `a` is 0 and the second element is 0, otherwise `res` is 2 if the first element of `a` is not 0, otherwise `res` is 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been incremented by 1. If the first element of `a` is 0 and the second element is 0, then `res` is now 3. If the first element of `a` is not 0, then `res` is now 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
