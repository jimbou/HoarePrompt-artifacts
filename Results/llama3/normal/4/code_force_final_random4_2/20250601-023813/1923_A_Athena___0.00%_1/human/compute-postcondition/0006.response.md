The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since the first element of `a` is 0, it is removed. The list `a` now has at least one element less than before. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with at least one element less than before, `res` is 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases**
