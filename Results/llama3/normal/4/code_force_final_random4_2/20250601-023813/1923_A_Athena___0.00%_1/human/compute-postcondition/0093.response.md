Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with all trailing zeros removed, `res` is the total number of zeros in `a`, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is `len(a)-1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `a` remains unchanged, the variable `res` now holds the total count of zeros in the list `a`, the variable `_` remains unchanged at 2, there are still `t-3` test cases in `stdin`, and the variable `i` now points to the last index of the list `a`.
