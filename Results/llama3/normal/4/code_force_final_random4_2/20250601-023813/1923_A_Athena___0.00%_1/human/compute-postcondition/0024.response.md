Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and all trailing zeros removed, `res` is 2 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` is 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, the list `a` is printed, `i` is 1**

The value of `res` is incremented by 1. Since `res` was initially 1 if the first element of `a` is 0, and 0 otherwise, it is now 2 if the first element of `a` is 0, and 1 otherwise. The values of the other variables are not affected.
