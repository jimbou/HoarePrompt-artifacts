Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block. The issue lies in the fact that the program only counts the number of zeros in the array after removing leading and trailing zeros, but it does not consider the actual positions of the chips and the zeros.

For example, consider the input [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]. The program will remove the leading and trailing zeros, resulting in [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]. It will then count the number of zeros, which is 2. However, the correct minimum number of operations is 3, because the chip in the third position needs to be moved to the left twice to form a single block.

The program does not correctly handle cases where there are multiple chips separated by zeros, and it does not consider the actual distances between the chips and the zeros. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
