The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and all trailing zeros removed. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `a` must have at least 3 elements.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements and all trailing zeros removed, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, the list `a` is printed, `_` is 0. If the second element of `a` is 0, `res` is 2 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` is 1. Otherwise, `res` is 1 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` is 0.**
