Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading and trailing zeros removed and has at least one more element, `res` is 2 if the current value of `a[i]` is 0, otherwise `res` is 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains the same, between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 0. The value of `n` is still an integer. The list `a` remains non-empty with all leading and trailing zeros removed and has at least one more element. The value of `res` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 2 if the current value of `a[i]` is 0, otherwise it becomes 1. The value of `_` remains 1. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains `t-3`. The value of `i` remains 1.
