Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading and trailing zeros removed and has at least 3 elements, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 2. If the current value of `a[i]` is 0, `res` is 3. Otherwise, `res` is 2.***
