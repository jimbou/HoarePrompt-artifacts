Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 2, n is an integer, a is a non-empty list of integers with all leading and trailing zeros removed, res is 0, _ is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is len(a)-1, the list a is being printed, and the number of zeros in the list a which is res is being printed**

Explanation:
The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` was already an integer, its type remains unchanged. The second line assigns a new list of integers to `a`, which replaces the original list. The third line resets `res` to 0, which means it no longer represents the number of zeros in the list `a`. The values of `t`, `_`, `i`, and the printing of the list `a` and the number of zeros in the list `a` remain unchanged. The only change is that `stdin` now contains `t-3` test cases, since two inputs have been consumed.
