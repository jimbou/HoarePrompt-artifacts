Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with at least one element, `res` is 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is `len(a)-1`, the list `a` is being printed, and the number of zeros in the list `a` which is `res` is being printed, and the first element of `a` has been removed.**

The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element of the list `a`. Since the first element of `a` was 0, it has been removed. The length of `a` has decreased by 1, so `i` is now `len(a)-1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
