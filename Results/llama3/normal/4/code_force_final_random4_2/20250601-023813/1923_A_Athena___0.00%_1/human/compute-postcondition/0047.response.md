The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` is 0, this element is removed. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains `t-3` test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed and the last element removed, `res` is 0, `_` is 1, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is undefined**
