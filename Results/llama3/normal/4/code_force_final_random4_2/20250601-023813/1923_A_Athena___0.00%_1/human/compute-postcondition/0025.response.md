Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and all trailing zeros removed, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, the list `a` is printed, `_` is 0. If the second element of `a` is 0, `res` is 2 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` is 1. Otherwise, `res` is 1 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` is 0.***
