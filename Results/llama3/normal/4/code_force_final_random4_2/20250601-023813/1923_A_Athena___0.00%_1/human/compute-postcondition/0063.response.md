The code prints the value of `res`, which is the number of zeros in the list `a`. Since the list `a` has all leading and trailing zeros removed, `res` will be the count of zeros within the list, excluding any leading or trailing zeros that may have been present before removal.

Output: **the number of zeros in the list a (excluding leading and trailing zeros)**
