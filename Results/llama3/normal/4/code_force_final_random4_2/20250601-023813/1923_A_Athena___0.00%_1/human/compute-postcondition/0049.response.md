Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a non-empty list of integers with all leading and trailing zeros removed, res is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is undefined**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `a` will have all trailing zeros removed, in addition to the leading zeros that were already removed in the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged.
