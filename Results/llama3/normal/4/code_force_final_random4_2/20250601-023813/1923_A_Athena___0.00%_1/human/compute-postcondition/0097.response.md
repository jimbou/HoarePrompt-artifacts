Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the total number of zeros in each test case after removing leading and trailing zeros. It accepts no parameters and returns no values, instead printing the results directly. The function iterates through each test case, removes leading and trailing zeros from the input list, counts the remaining zeros, and prints the count. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, leaving the input variables in a modified state.**
