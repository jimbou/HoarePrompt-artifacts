Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed, `res` is the number of zeros in `a`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, the list `a` is printed, `i` is `len(a)-1`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t`, `n`, `_`, and `stdin` as in the initial state. The list `a` will still have all trailing zeros removed and will be printed. The variable `i` will be equal to the last index of the list `a`, which is `len(a)-1`. The variable `res` will be equal to the total number of zeros in the list `a`.
