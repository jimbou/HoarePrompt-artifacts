Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with all trailing zeros removed, `res` is 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is `len(a)-1`, the list `a` is being printed, and the number of zeros in the list `a` which is `res` is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `a` has all trailing zeros removed, and the number of zeros in the list `a` is still 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
