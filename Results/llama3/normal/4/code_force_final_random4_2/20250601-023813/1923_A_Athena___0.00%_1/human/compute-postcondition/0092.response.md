Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty list of integers with all trailing zeros removed and has at least 3 elements. If the first element of `a` is 0 and the second element is 0, `res` is 3 if `a[i]` is 0, otherwise `res` is 2. If the first element of `a` is not 0, `res` is 2. `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 2.***
