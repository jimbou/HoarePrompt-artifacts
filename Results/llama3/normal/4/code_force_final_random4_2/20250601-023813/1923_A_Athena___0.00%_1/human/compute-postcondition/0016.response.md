Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed, `res` is 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `a` will have all trailing zeros removed, while the other variables remain unchanged.
