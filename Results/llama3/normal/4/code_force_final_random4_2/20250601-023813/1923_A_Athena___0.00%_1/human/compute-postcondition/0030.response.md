Based on the initial state, the code `print(res)` will print the number of zeros in the list `a`.

Since `res` is defined as the number of zeros in `a`, and `a` is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed, the value of `res` will be the count of zeros in the list `a`.

Output: **the number of zeros in the list a**
