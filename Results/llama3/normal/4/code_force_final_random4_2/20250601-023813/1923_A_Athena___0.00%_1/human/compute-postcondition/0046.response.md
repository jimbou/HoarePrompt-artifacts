To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `a` so that it still meets the condition `a and a[-1] == 0`. Since `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed, we can adjust its state by adding a 0 to the end of the list.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed and the last element is 0, `res` is 0, `_` is 1, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is undefined**
