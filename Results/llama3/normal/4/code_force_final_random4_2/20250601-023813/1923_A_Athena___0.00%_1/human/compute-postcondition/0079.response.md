Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed, ends with at least one zero, `res` is 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is `len(a)-2`, the list `a` is being printed, and the number of zeros in the list `a` which is `res` is being printed.**

In this output state, the list `a` has been modified by removing its last element using the `pop()` method. The value of `i` has been updated to `len(a)-2` because the length of the list `a` has decreased by 1. The other variables `_`, `res`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The list `a` is still being printed, and the number of zeros in the list `a` is still being printed, but the value of `res` remains 0.
