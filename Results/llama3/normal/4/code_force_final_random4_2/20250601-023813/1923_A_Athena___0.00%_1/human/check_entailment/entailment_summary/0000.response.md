Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of moving chips on a ribbon to form a single block without any free cells between them. The program reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the total number of zeros in each test case after removing leading and trailing zeros.

The program's logic is as follows:

1.  Read the number of test cases (`t`) and iterate through each test case.
2.  For each test case, read the number of cells (`n`) and the cell values (`a`).
3.  Remove leading and trailing zeros from the cell values (`a`) using `pop(0)` and `pop()`.
4.  Count the remaining zeros in the modified cell values (`a`) and store the count in `res`.
5.  Print the count of remaining zeros (`res`) for each test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it accurately implements the problem's requirements. The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
