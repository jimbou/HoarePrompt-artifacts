Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30)**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` have been updated to the values read from the input, which are integers between 1 and 100, 1 and 30, and 1 and 30, respectively. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 1. The stdin now contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b, as one line has been read and processed.
