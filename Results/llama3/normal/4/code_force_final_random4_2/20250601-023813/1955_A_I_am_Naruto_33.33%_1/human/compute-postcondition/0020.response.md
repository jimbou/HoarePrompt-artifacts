Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is an integer between 1 and 30, b is an integer between 1 and 30, _ is 2, ans1 is an integer between 1 and 3000, ans2 is an integer between 1 and 1500, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30).**

The code block calculates two values, `ans1` and `ans2`, based on the initial values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. `ans1` is the product of `a` and `n`, resulting in a value between 1 and 3000. `ans2` is calculated as half of the product of `b` and `n`, plus the remainder of the product of `a` and `n` divided by 2, resulting in a value between 1 and 1500. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `_` remain unchanged, and the contents of stdin are not affected by the code.
