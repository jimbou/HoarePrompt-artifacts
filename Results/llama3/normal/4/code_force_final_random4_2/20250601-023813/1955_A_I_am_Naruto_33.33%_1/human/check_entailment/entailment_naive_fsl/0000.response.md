Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. It considers two cases: buying all yogurts at the regular price (a * n) and buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price (b * n // 2) and the remaining yogurts at the regular price (a * n % 2). It then prints the minimum of these two cases.

The program handles the case where n is 1 correctly by printing the price of a single yogurt (a). It also handles the case where n is greater than 1 correctly by considering the two cases mentioned above.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
