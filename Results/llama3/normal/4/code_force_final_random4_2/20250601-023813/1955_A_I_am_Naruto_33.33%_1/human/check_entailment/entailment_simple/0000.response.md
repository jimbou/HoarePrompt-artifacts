Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

*   The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
*   For each test case, it reads the number of yogurts `n`, the price of one yogurt `a`, and the price of two yogurts on promotion `b`.
*   If `n` is greater than 1, the program calculates two possible costs:
    *   `ans1`: the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price `a`.
    *   `ans2`: the cost of buying `n` yogurts with the promotion, which is the cost of buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price `b` plus the cost of buying the remaining `n % 2` yogurts at the regular price `a`.
*   The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
*   If `n` is 1, the program simply prints the price of one yogurt `a`, as there's no promotion to consider.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and calculates the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts based on the given prices and promotion.

Correctness: **True**
