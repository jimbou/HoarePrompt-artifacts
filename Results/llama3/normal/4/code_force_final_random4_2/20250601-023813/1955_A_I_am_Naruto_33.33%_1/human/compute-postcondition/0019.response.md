The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads a line from the input, splits it into three parts, and assigns the integer values to `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively.

Since the initial state specifies that `stdin` contains `t-2` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, the first line is read and assigned to `n`, `a`, and `b`.

The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are now integers between 1 and 100, 1 and 30, and 1 and 30 respectively, as specified by the input.

The variable `_` is not affected by this code and remains equal to 2.

The `stdin` now contains `t-3` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30).**
