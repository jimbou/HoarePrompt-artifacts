The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and the range of the loop depends on the input from `stdin`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `_` and the number of lines in `stdin`. If `_` is less than the number of lines in `stdin`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, and `stdin` contains t-3 lines. So for the loop to be executed one more time `_` must be 2 and `stdin` must contain at least t-2 lines.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30).**
