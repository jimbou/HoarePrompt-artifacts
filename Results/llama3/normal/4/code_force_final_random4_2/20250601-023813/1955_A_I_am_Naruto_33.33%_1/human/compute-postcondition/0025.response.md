Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). If `n` > 1, the minimum value between `ans1` and `ans2` is printed. Otherwise, the value of `a` is printed.***
