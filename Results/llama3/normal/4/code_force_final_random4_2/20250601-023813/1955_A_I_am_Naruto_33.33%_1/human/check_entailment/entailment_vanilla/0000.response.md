Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts at the "Vosmiorochka" store. The program takes into account the promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program iterates over the number of test cases (t) using a for loop.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of yogurts (n), the price for one yogurt (a), and the price for two yogurts on promotion (b) from the input.
3. If the number of yogurts (n) is greater than 1, the program calculates two possible costs:
   - ans1: The cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * n).
   - ans2: The cost of buying n yogurts using the promotion (b * n // 2 + a * n % 2). This calculation takes into account the fact that you can buy two yogurts for b burles, so it divides n by 2 and multiplies the result by b. It also adds the cost of any remaining yogurts (n % 2) at the regular price (a).
4. The program then prints the minimum of these two costs (min(ans1, ans2)).
5. If the number of yogurts (n) is 1, the program simply prints the cost of buying one yogurt at the regular price (a).

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible scenarios. It correctly calculates the minimum cost of buying n yogurts using the promotion and the regular price.

Correctness: **True**
