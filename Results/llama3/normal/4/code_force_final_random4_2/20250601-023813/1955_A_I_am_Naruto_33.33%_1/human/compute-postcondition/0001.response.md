Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30)**

In this output state, the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` have been assigned the values from the first line of the input, which contains three integers. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. The stdin now contains t-1 lines, each with three integers, as one line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
