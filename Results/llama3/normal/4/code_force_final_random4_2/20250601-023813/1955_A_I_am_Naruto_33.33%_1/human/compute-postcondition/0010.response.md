To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. Here, `_` is the loop variable, and `int(input())` is the range. The state at the end of the previous iteration is:

* `n` is an integer between 1 and 100
* `a` is an integer between 1 and 30
* `b` is an integer between 1 and 30
* `_` is 0
* stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30)

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider what changes when the loop executes again. The loop variable `_` will increment by 1, and the range will decrease by 1.

Since `_` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will become 1 at the start of the next iteration.

The range `int(input())` will decrease by 1, so the new range will be `int(input()) - 1`. This means that the number of lines in stdin will decrease by 1, so stdin will contain t-2 lines.

The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by the loop head, so they remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30)**
