Output State: **a is a list of integers from 1 to the input integer (greater than 0) in reverse order for even indices and in ascending order for odd indices, stdin contains multiple lines each containing a single integer (greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 10^5)**

The first line assigns to `a` a list of integers from 1 to the input integer (greater than 0). The second line reverses the order of the elements at even indices in `a`. Since the list is now modified, the output state only includes the modified list `a` and the remaining input in stdin.
