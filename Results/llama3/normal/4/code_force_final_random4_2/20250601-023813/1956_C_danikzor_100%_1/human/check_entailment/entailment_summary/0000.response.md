Reasoning:
The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing a series of operations. The program reads the number of test cases and the size of the matrix from standard input, calculates the maximum sum, and prints the result along with the sequence of operations to achieve this sum.

The program's logic is based on the mathematical formula for the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers, which is n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6. This formula is used to calculate the maximum sum for each test case.

The program then prints the sequence of operations to achieve this sum. For each test case, it prints 2n operations, where each operation is either a Type 1 operation (assigning a permutation to a row) or a Type 2 operation (assigning a permutation to a column). The permutations used in these operations are the reverse of the natural numbers from 1 to n.

Based on the execution summary, the program correctly reads the input, calculates the maximum sum, and prints the result along with the sequence of operations.

Correctness: **True**
