Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing a series of operations. The program takes the number of test cases and the size of the matrix as input.

The program calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix using the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`, which is the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers. This is a correct calculation.

The program then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, which is `2 * n`. This is also correct, as the program performs 2 operations for each row and column of the matrix.

The program then performs the operations by printing the type of operation (1 for rows and 2 for columns), the row or column number, and the permutation of numbers from n to 1 in reverse order. This is a correct implementation of the operations described in the problem.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
