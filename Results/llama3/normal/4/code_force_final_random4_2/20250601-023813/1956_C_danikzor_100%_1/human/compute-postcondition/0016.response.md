The code prints the number 2, the value of `i` which is 3, and the numbers from `n` down to 1 in reverse order.
Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the numbers in the reverse order. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the number 2, the value of `i` which is 3, and the numbers from `n` down to 1 in reverse order.
Output: **2, 3, n, n-1, n-2, ..., 2, 1 (where n is a number greater than 3)**
