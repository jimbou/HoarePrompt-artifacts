Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the size of the matrix `n` from standard input.

2. It calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix using the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`, which is the sum of squares of the first `n` natural numbers. This is the maximum sum that can be achieved by filling the matrix with numbers from 1 to `n` in a way that maximizes the sum.

3. It prints the calculated maximum sum and the number of operations, which is `2 * n`. This is correct because the program performs `2 * n` operations to fill the matrix.

4. The program then prints the operations to fill the matrix. For each row and column, it prints the numbers from `n` down to 1 in reverse order. This is a valid permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`, and it maximizes the sum of the numbers in the matrix.

5. The program iterates through each test case and prints the calculated values and the pattern of numbers until all test cases have been processed.

Therefore, the program is correct and produces the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
