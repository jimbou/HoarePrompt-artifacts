Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix, but the program does not provide a solution that maximizes the sum.

For example, when n = 2, the program outputs:

7 3
1 1 1 2
1 2 1 2
2 1 1 2

However, this solution does not maximize the sum of the numbers in the matrix. A better solution would be to set a_{1,1} = 2, a_{1,2} = 1, a_{2,1} = 1, and a_{2,2} = 2, which would result in a sum of 8.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not provide a solution that maximizes the sum of the numbers in the matrix for all potential cases.
