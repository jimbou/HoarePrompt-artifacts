Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the following is printed: 2, the value of `i` which is `n`, and the numbers from `n` down to 1 in reverse order**

This output state means that the loop has executed for all iterations, and the value of `i` has reached `n`. The loop has printed the numbers from `n` down to 1 in reverse order, and the value of `i` is now equal to `n`. The state of the other variables, such as `n` being an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, and stdin containing multiple test cases minus one, remains unchanged.
