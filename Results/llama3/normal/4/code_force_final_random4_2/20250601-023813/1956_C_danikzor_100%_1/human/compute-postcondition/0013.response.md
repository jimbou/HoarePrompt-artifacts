According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the following is printed: 1, the value of `i` which is 3, and the numbers from `n` down to 1 in reverse order**
