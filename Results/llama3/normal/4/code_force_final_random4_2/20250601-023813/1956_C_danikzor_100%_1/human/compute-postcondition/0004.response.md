The code prints the value of 1, the value of `i` which is 1, and the values generated by the `range(n, 0, -1)` function. The `range(n, 0, -1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from `n`, stopping before 0, and decrementing by 1 each time.

Since `n` is greater than 0, the sequence generated by `range(n, 0, -1)` will include all integers from `n` down to 1.

Therefore, the output will be a sequence of numbers starting from 1, followed by the value of `i` which is 1, and then the sequence of numbers from `n` down to 1.

Output: **1, 1, n, n-1, n-2, ..., 2, 1**
