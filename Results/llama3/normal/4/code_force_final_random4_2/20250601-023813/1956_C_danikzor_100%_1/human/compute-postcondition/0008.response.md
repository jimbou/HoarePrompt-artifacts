The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the following is printed: 2, the value of `i` which is 1, and the numbers from `n` down to 1 in reverse order**
