Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix that can be achieved by performing at most 2n operations of two types: Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 operation involves assigning a permutation of integers from 1 to n to a row, while Type 2 operation involves assigning a permutation of integers from 1 to n to a column.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by performing 2n operations, where each operation assigns a permutation of integers from n to 1 to a row or column.

The program first calculates the maximum sum of all numbers in the matrix, which is given by the formula n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6. This formula is derived from the fact that the sum of all numbers in the matrix is equal to the sum of the first n positive integers, which is n * (n + 1) // 2, multiplied by the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix, which is n.

The program then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, which is 2n.

Next, the program performs 2n operations, where each operation assigns a permutation of integers from n to 1 to a row or column. The program uses a loop to iterate over each row and column, and for each iteration, it prints the type of operation (1 for row and 2 for column), the row or column index, and the permutation of integers from n to 1.

The program's approach is correct because it ensures that each number from 1 to n is assigned to each row and column exactly once, which maximizes the sum of all numbers in the matrix.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
