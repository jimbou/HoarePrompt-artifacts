Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**.

In this output state, the value of `n` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 500 inclusive. The stdin contains multiple test cases, but since one test case has been read, the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one.
