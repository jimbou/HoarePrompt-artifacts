The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the following is printed: the product of n, n+1, and 4n-1 divided by 6 and 2 times n**
