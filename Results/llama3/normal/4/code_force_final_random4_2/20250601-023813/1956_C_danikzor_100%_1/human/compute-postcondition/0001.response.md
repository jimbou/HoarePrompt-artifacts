The code prints the value of the expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` and `2 * n`. 

Here, `n` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.

The expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is a formula for calculating the sum of squares of the first `n` natural numbers. 

The expression `2 * n` simply doubles the value of `n`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expressions. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated sum of squares and the doubled value of `n`.

Output: **sum of squares of the first n natural numbers, 2n (where n is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive)**
