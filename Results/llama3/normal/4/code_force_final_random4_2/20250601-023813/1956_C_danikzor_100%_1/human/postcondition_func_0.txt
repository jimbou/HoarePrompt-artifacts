This function reads the number of test cases and the size of a matrix from standard input, calculates and prints the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers and 2n, and then prints a specific pattern of numbers for each test case. The function iterates through each test case, printing the calculated values and the pattern of numbers, until all test cases have been processed.
