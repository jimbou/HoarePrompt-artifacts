Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of string a of length k is a subsequence of string b. The program uses a while loop to iterate through both strings a and b, and a helper function func_1 to find the index of the first occurrence of a substring a[i] within a slice of string b[j:]. If the substring is found, the program updates the indices i and j and increments the counter c. If the substring is not found, the program breaks the loop.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible number k. It iterates through both strings, checks for the occurrence of the substring, and updates the indices and counter accordingly. The use of the helper function func_1 simplifies the code and makes it more readable.

The program also handles the edge cases correctly. If the substring a[i] is not found in b[j:], the program returns -1 and breaks the loop, which is the correct behavior.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
