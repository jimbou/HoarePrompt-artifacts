Output State: **The program returns -1, indicating that the substring `a[i]` is not found in the substring `b[j:]`.**

In this output state, the value -1 is returned, which represents the index value. The index value -1 means that the substring `a[i]` is not present in the substring `b[j:]`. This is because the initial state specifies that `index` is -1, meaning `a[i]` is not found in `b[j:]`.
