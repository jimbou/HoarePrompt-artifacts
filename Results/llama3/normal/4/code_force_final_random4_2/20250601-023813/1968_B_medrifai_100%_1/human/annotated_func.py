#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are binary strings, i and j are non-negative integers such that 0 <= i < len(a) and 0 <= j < len(b).
    index = b[j:].find(a[i])
    if (index != -1) :
        return j + index
        #The program returns the sum of `j` and `index`, where `j` is a non-negative integer less than the length of binary string `b`, and `index` is the index of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in `b[j:]`, which is a non-negative integer less than the length of the slice `b[j:]`
    else :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1, indicating that the substring `a[i]` is not found in the substring `b[j:]`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function searches for the first occurrence of a substring `a[i]` within a slice of another binary string `b[j:]`. If found, it returns the index of the occurrence within the original string `b`. If not found, it returns -1. The function takes two binary strings `a` and `b`, and two non-negative integers `i` and `j` as input, where `i` and `j` are indices within `a` and `b` respectively.
