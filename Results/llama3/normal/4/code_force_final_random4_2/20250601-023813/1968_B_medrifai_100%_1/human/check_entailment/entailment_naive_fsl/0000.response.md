Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program correctly determines the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of string a of length k is a subsequence of string b. 

Here's why:

1. The program iterates through both strings a and b simultaneously using two pointers, i and j.
2. For each character in a, it uses the func_1 function to find the index of the same character in the remaining part of string b (starting from index j).
3. If the character is found, it increments both pointers i and j, and increments the count c.
4. If the character is not found, it breaks the loop.
5. Finally, it prints the count c, which represents the maximum possible number k.

The func_1 function correctly finds the index of the character in the remaining part of string b. It uses the find method of the string, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the character, or -1 if the character is not found.

The program handles all edge cases correctly:

* If string a is empty, the program will print 0, which is correct.
* If string b is empty, the program will print 0, which is correct.
* If string a is longer than string b, the program will print the length of the common prefix, which is correct.
* If string a is shorter than string b, the program will print the length of string a, which is correct.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
