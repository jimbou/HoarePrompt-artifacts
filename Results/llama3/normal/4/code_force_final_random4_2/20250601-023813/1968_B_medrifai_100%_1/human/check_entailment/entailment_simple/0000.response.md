Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of string a of length k is a subsequence of string b. The program uses a two-pointer approach, where it iterates through both strings a and b simultaneously.

The function `func_1` is used to find the index of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in `b[j:]`. If `a[i]` is found in `b[j:]`, the function returns the sum of `j` and the index of `a[i]` in `b[j:]`, which is used to update the pointer `j` in the main loop. If `a[i]` is not found in `b[j:]`, the function returns -1, which causes the main loop to break.

The main loop continues until either the end of string a or string b is reached. The variable `c` is used to keep track of the maximum possible number k.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of string a of length k is a subsequence of string b.

Correctness: **True**
