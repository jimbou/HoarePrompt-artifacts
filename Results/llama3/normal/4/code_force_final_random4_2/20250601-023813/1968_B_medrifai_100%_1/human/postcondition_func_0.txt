This function searches for the first occurrence of a substring `a[i]` within a slice of another binary string `b[j:]`. If found, it returns the index of the occurrence within the original string `b`. If not found, it returns -1. The function takes two binary strings `a` and `b`, and two non-negative integers `i` and `j` as input, where `i` and `j` are indices within `a` and `b` respectively.
