Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string s, `i` is the last character in the string `p`, and `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in `p` that is not present in the dictionary `hmp`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop has iterated over all characters in the string `p` ('ABCDEFG'). The variable `i` now points to the last character in `p`, which is 'G'. The variable `ans` has been incremented by `m` for each character in `p` that is not present in the dictionary `hmp`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
