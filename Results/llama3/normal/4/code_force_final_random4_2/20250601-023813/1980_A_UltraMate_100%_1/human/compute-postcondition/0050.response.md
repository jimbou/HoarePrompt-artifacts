Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string s and must have at least 7 key-value pairs, `i` is one of the keys in the dictionary `hmp`. If the count of character `i` in `hmp` is less than `m`, then `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in `p` that is not present in the dictionary `hmp` plus `m - hmp[i]` plus `m - hmp[i]` plus `m - hmp[i]` plus `m - hmp[i]` plus `m - hmp[i]` plus `m - hmp[i]` plus `m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in `p` that is not present in the dictionary `hmp` plus `m - hmp[i]` plus `m - hmp[i]` plus `m - hmp[i]` plus `m - hmp[i]` plus `m - hmp[i]` plus `m - hmp[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the dictionary `hmp` will have at least 7 key-value pairs, and the variable `ans` will be the sum of `m` for each character in `p` that is not present in the dictionary `hmp` plus the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for each character `i` in `hmp` that has a count less than `m`.
