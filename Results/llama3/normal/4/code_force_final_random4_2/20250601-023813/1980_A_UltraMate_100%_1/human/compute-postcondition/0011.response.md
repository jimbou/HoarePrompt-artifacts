Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s`, `i` is 'C'. If 'B' is not a key in the dictionary `hmp`, then `ans` is `m`. Otherwise, `ans` is `m` if 'B' is a key in the dictionary `hmp` and `ans` was 0, otherwise `ans` is increased by `m`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been updated. If 'B' is not a key in the dictionary `hmp`, then `ans` is still `m`. If 'B' is a key in the dictionary `hmp`, then `ans` is increased by `m` if it was 0, otherwise it remains the same.
