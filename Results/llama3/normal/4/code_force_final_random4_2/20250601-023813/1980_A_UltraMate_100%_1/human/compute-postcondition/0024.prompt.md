Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer that must be at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, s is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', p is 'ABCDEFG', hmp is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string s, i is 'G'. If all characters from 'A' to 'G' are keys in the dictionary hmp, then ans is 0. If one character from 'A' to 'G' is not a key in the dictionary hmp, then ans is m. If two characters from 'A' to 'G' are not keys in the dictionary hmp, then ans is 2*m. If three characters from 'A' to 'G' are not keys in the dictionary hmp, then ans is 3*m. If four characters from 'A' to 'G' are not keys in the dictionary hmp, then ans is 4*m. If five characters from 'A' to 'G' are not keys in the dictionary hmp, then ans is 5*m. If six characters from 'A' to 'G' are not keys in the dictionary hmp, then ans is 6*m. If seven characters from 'A' to 'G' are not keys in the dictionary hmp, then ans is 7*m.
Code of the loop:
for i in hmp:
    if hmp[i] < m:
        ans += m - hmp[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer that must be at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, s is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', p is 'ABCDEFG', hmp is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string s and hmp must have at least 1 key-value pair, i is a key in the dictionary hmp, if the current value of hmp[i] is less than m, then ans is either m, 2*m, 3*m, 4*m, 5*m, 6*m, 7*m, 8*m or 9*m. Otherwise, ans is either 0, m, 2*m, 3*m, 4*m, 5*m, 6*m or 7*m.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s` and `hmp` must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `i` is the next key in the dictionary `hmp`. If the current value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is either `m+1`, `2*m+1`, `3*m+1`, `4*m+1`, `5*m+1`, `6*m+1`, `7*m+1`, `8*m+1` or `9*m+1`. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1, `m+1`, `2*m+1`, `3*m+1`, `4*m+1`, `5*m+1`, `6*m+1` or `7*m+1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s` and `hmp` must have at least 1 key-value pair, `i` is the next key in the dictionary `hmp`. If the current value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is either `m+2`, `2*m+2`, `3*m+2`, `4*m+2`, `5*m+2`, `6*m+2`, `7*m+2`, `8*m+2` or `9*m+2`. Otherwise, `ans` is either 2, `m+2`, `2*m+2`, `3*m+2`, `4*m+2`, `5*m+2`, `6*m+2` or `7*m+2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
