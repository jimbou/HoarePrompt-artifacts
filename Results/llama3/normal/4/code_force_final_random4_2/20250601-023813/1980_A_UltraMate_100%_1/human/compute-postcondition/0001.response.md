To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is at least 1 and `_` is now 0.

State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5). The second line contains a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G'.**
