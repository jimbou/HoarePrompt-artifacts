Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string s, `i` is the last character in the string `p`, and `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in `p` that is not present in the dictionary `hmp`.
Code of the loop:
for i in hmp:
    if hmp[i] < m:
        ans += m - hmp[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string s and must have at least 1 key-value pair, `i` is one of the keys in the dictionary `hmp`. If the count of character `i` in `hmp` is less than `m`, then `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in `p` that is not present in the dictionary `hmp` plus `m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in `p` that is not present in the dictionary `hmp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string s and must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `i` is one of the keys in the dictionary `hmp`. If the count of character `i` in `hmp` is less than `m`, then `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in `p` that is not present in the dictionary `hmp` plus `m - hmp[i]` plus `m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in `p` that is not present in the dictionary `hmp` plus `m - hmp[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string s and must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `i` is another key in the dictionary `hmp`. If the count of character `i` in string `s` is less than `m`, then `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
