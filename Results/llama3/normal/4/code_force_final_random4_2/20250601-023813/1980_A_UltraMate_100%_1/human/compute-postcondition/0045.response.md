Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string s and must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `i` is one of the keys in the dictionary `hmp`. If the count of character `i` in `hmp` is less than `m`, then `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in `p` that is not present in the dictionary `hmp` plus `m - hmp[i]` plus `m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in `p` that is not present in the dictionary `hmp` plus `m - hmp[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `ans` has been updated by adding `m - hmp[i]` to its previous value. The value of `ans` now depends on whether the count of character `i` in `hmp` is less than `m` or not. If it is less than `m`, then `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in `p` that is not present in the dictionary `hmp` plus `m - hmp[i]` plus `m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in `p` that is not present in the dictionary `hmp` plus `m - hmp[i]`.
