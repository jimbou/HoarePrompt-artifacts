Output State: **t is an integer that must be at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, s is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', p is 'ABCDEFG', hmp is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string s and hmp must have at least 1 key-value pair, i is a key in the dictionary hmp, ans is either m, 2*m, 3*m, 4*m, 5*m, 6*m, 7*m, 8*m or 9*m, and the current value of hmp[i] is less than m.**

The value of `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`, where `hmp[i]` is the count of character `i` in string `s`. Since `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, the value of `ans` is increased by a positive value. The possible values of `ans` are updated to include the new possible values after the increment. The other variables remain unchanged.
