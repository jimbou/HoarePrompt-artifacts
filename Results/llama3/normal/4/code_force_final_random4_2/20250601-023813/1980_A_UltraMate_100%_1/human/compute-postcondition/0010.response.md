The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `p`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `p`. If `i` is less than the length of `p`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 'B', `p` is 'ABCDEFG'. For the loop to execute again `i` is 'C'.
State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s`, `i` is 'C'. If 'B' is not a key in the dictionary `hmp`, then `ans` is `m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
