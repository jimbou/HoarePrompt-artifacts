Postcondition: ***t is an integer that must be at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, s is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', p is 'ABCDEFG', hmp is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string s and hmp must have at least 1 key-value pair, i is a key in the dictionary hmp, if the current value of hmp[i] is less than m, then ans is either m, 2*m, 3*m, 4*m, 5*m, 6*m, 7*m, 8*m or 9*m. Otherwise, ans is either 0, m, 2*m, 3*m, 4*m, 5*m, 6*m or 7*m.***
