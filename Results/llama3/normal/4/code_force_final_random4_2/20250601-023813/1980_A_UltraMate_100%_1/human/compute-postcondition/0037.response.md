Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG' and must have at least 3 characters, `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string s, `i` is the third character in the string `p`, `ans` is increased by `m`**.

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been increased by the value of `m`, which is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive. All other variables remain unchanged.
