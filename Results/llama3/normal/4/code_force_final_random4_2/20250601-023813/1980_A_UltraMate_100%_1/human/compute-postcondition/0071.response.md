Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s` and must have at least 7 key-value pairs, `i` is a key in `hmp`. If the count of character `i` in string `s` is less than `m`, then `ans` is an integer between `m-hmp[i]+m-hmp[i]` and 25+ m-hmp[i] inclusive. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `m - hmp[i]` to it, but only if the count of character `i` in string `s` is less than `m`. If this condition is not met, the state of the variables remains unchanged. The other variables retain their original values and properties.
