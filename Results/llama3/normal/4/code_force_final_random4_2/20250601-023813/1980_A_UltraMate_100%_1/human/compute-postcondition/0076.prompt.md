Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer that must be at least 2, _ is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, s is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', p is 'ABCDEFG', hmp is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string s and must have at least 7 key-value pairs, i is 'G', ans is an integer between 0 and 25 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for i in hmp:
    if hmp[i] < m:
        ans += m - hmp[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer that must be at least 2, _ is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, s is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', p is 'ABCDEFG', hmp is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string s and must have at least 7 key-value pairs, i is a key in hmp. If the count of character i in string s is less than m, then ans is an integer between m-hmp[i] and 25 inclusive. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s` and must have at least 7 key-value pairs, `i` is a key in `hmp`. If the count of character `i` in string `s` is less than `m`, then `ans` is an integer between `m-hmp[i]+m-hmp[i]` and 25+ m-hmp[i] inclusive. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-6 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s` and must have at least 6 key-value pairs, `i` is another key in `hmp`. If the count of character `i` in string `s` is less than `m`, then `ans` is an integer between `m-hmp[i]+m-hmp[i]` and 25+ m-hmp[i] inclusive and is increased by `m-hmp[i]`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
