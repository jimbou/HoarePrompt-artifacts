Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s` and must have at least 7 key-value pairs, `i` is the next character in `p` after its current value, `ans` is increased by `m` if `i` is not in `hmp`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `ans` has been increased by `m` if `i` is not in `hmp`. This means that if `i` is not present in the dictionary `hmp`, the value of `ans` will be incremented by the value of `m`, which is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive. All other variables remain unchanged.
