Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-6 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s` and must have at least 6 key-value pairs, `i` is another key in `hmp`. If the count of character `i` in string `s` is less than `m`, then `ans` is an integer between `m-hmp[i]+m-hmp[i]` and 25+ m-hmp[i] inclusive and is increased by `m-hmp[i]`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains the same, and the value of `_` is still 2. The number of test cases in stdin is decreased by 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `p`, and `hmp` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still a key in `hmp`. If the count of character `i` in string `s` is less than `m`, then the value of `ans` is increased by `m-hmp[i]` and is within the range of `m-hmp[i]+m-hmp[i]` and 25+ m-hmp[i] inclusive. If the count of character `i` in string `s` is not less than `m`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.
