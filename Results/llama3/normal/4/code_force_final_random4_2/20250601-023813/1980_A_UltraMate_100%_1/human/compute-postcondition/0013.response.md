Output State: **t is an integer that must be at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, s is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', p is 'ABCDEFG', hmp is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string s, i is 'G'. If all characters from 'A' to 'G' are keys in the dictionary hmp, then ans is 0. If one character from 'A' to 'G' is not a key in the dictionary hmp, then ans is m. If two characters from 'A' to 'G' are not keys in the dictionary hmp, then ans is 2*m. If three characters from 'A' to 'G' are not keys in the dictionary hmp, then ans is 3*m. If four characters from 'A' to 'G' are not keys in the dictionary hmp, then ans is 4*m. If five characters from 'A' to 'G' are not keys in the dictionary hmp, then ans is 5*m. If six characters from 'A' to 'G' are not keys in the dictionary hmp, then ans is 6*m. If seven characters from 'A' to 'G' are not keys in the dictionary hmp, then ans is 7*m.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variable `i` which is now 'G' and the variable `ans` which depends on the number of characters from 'A' to 'G' that are not keys in the dictionary `hmp`. If all characters are keys in `hmp`, then `ans` is 0. If one character is not a key, then `ans` is `m`. If two characters are not keys, then `ans` is 2 times `m`. If three characters are not keys, then `ans` is 3 times `m`. If four characters are not keys, then `ans` is 4 times `m`. If five characters are not keys, then `ans` is 5 times `m`. If six characters are not keys, then `ans` is 6 times `m`. If seven characters are not keys, then `ans` is 7 times `m`.
