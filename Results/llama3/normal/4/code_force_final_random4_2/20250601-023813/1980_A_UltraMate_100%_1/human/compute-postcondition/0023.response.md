Postcondition: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s` and `hmp` must have at least 1 key-value pair, `i` is the next key in the dictionary `hmp`. If the current value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is either `m+2`, `2*m+2`, `3*m+2`, `4*m+2`, `5*m+2`, `6*m+2`, `7*m+2`, `8*m+2` or `9*m+2`. Otherwise, `ans` is either 2, `m+2`, `2*m+2`, `3*m+2`, `4*m+2`, `5*m+2`, `6*m+2` or `7*m+2**
