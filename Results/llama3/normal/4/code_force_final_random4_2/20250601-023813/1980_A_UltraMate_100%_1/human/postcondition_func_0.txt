This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and m, and the second line contains a string s of n characters. The function then calculates the total number of characters in the string that appear less than m times and prints this count for each test case. The function processes all test cases and does not return any value.
