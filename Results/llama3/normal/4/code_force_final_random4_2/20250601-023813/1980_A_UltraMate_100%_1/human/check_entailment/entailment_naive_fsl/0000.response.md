Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the number of problems in the bank (n) is less than the number of upcoming rounds (m). In this case, the program will output a value that is greater than the actual number of problems that need to be created.

For example, if n = 3, m = 5, and the string of difficulties is "ABC", the program will output 10, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 2, because Vlad only needs to create 2 more problems of difficulty levels 'D' and 'E' to hold 5 rounds.

The issue is that the program is adding m to the answer for each difficulty level that is not present in the bank, which is incorrect. Instead, it should only add the difference between m and the number of problems of each difficulty level that are already in the bank.
