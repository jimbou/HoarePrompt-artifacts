Output State: **t is an integer that must be at least 2, _ is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, s is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', p is 'ABCDEFG', hmp is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string s and must have at least 7 key-value pairs, i is a key in hmp, ans is an integer between m-hmp[i] and 25 inclusive.**

The value of `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`, where `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, and `hmp[i]` is less than `m`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
