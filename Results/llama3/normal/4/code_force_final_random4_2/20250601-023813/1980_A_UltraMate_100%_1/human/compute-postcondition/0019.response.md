Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s` and `hmp` must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `i` is the next key in the dictionary `hmp`, if the current value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is either `m+1`, `2*m+1`, `3*m+1`, `4*m+1`, `5*m+1`, `6*m+1`, `7*m+1`, `8*m+1` or `9*m+1`. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1, `m+1`, `2*m+1`, `3*m+1`, `4*m+1`, `5*m+1`, `6*m+1` or `7*m+1`.**

The value of `ans` is updated by adding `m - hmp[i]` to its current value. Since `hmp[i]` is the count of character `i` in string `s`, and `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, the value of `m - hmp[i]` can be either positive or negative. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `m - hmp[i]` is positive, and `ans` is updated by adding a positive value. Otherwise, `m - hmp[i]` is negative, and `ans` is updated by adding a negative value. The values of the other variables are not affected.
