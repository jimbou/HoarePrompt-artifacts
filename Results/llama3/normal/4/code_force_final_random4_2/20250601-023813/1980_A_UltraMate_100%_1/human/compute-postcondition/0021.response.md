To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that must be met for the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in hmp:`, where `hmp` is a dictionary with keys from 'A' to 'G' and values representing their respective counts in string `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the next key in the dictionary `hmp`. For the loop to execute again, there must be another key in the dictionary `hmp` that has not been processed yet.

Since `hmp` must have at least 2 key-value pairs, and we have already processed one key in the previous iteration, there must be at least one more key left to process.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s` and `hmp` must have at least 1 key-value pair, `i` is the next key in the dictionary `hmp`. If the current value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is either `m+1`, `2*m+1`, `3*m+1`, `4*m+1`, `5*m+1`, `6*m+1`, `7*m+1`, `8*m+1` or `9*m+1`. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1, `m+1`, `2*m+1`, `3*m+1`, `4*m+1`, `5*m+1`, `6*m+1` or `7*m+1**.
