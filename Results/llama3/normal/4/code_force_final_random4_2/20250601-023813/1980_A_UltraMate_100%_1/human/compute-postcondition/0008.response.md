Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s`, `i` is 'B', `ans` is either `m` or `m+0` depending on whether 'B' is a key in the dictionary `hmp`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is incremented by `m` if 'B' is a key in the dictionary `hmp`, otherwise it remains the same. All other variables remain unchanged.
