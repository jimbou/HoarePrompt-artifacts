Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s` and `hmp` must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `i` is the next key in the dictionary `hmp`. If the current value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is either `m+1`, `2*m+1`, `3*m+1`, `4*m+1`, `5*m+1`, `6*m+1`, `7*m+1`, `8*m+1` or `9*m+1`. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1, `m+1`, `2*m+1`, `3*m+1`, `4*m+1`, `5*m+1`, `6*m+1` or `7*m+1`.***
