Output State: **t is an integer that must be at least 2, _ is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, s is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', p is 'ABCDEFG', hmp is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string s and must have at least 7 key-value pairs, i is 'G', ans is an integer between 0 and 25 inclusive.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variable `i` which is now 'G' (the last character in the string `p`) and the variable `ans` which is now an integer between 0 and 25 inclusive, depending on how many characters in `p` were not in `hmp`.
