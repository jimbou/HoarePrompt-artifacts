Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG' and must have at least 1 character, `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string s, `i` is the first character in the string `p`, and `ans` is `m`. The current value of `i` is not present in the dictionary `hmp`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG' and must have at least 1 character, `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string s, `i` is the first character in the string `p`, and `ans` is increased by `m`. The current value of `i` is not present in the dictionary `hmp`.
