The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `t` to be the integer from the input, where `input()` accepts an integer and `int()` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. Since the first integer is taken as input, stdin now contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5). The second line contains a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G'.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5). The second line contains a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G'.**
