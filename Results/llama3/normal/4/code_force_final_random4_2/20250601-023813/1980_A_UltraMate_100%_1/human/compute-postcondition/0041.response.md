Postcondition: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string s and must have at least 1 key-value pair, `i` is one of the keys in the dictionary `hmp`, and `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in `p` that is not present in the dictionary `hmp`. The current value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.**
