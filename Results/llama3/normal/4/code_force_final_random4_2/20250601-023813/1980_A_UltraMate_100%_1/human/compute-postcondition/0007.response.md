To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for i in p:`, where `p` is the string `'ABCDEFG'`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `'A'`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to move to the next character in the string `p`. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to `'B'`.

The other variables in the state, such as `t`, `_`, `stdin`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `hmp`, and `ans`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s`, `i` is 'B'. If the current value of `i` is not a key in the dictionary `hmp`, then `ans` is `m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
