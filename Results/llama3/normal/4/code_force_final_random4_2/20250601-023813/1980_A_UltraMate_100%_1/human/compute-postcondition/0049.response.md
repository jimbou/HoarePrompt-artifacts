Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string s and must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `i` is another key in the dictionary `hmp`. If the count of character `i` in string `s` is less than `m`, then `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.***
