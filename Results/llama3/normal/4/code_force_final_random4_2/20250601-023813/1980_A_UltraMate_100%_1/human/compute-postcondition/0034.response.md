Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG' and must have at least 2 characters, `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string s, `i` is the second character in the string `p`, `ans` is increased by `m`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been increased by the value of `m`, which is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive. All other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still being at least 2, `_` still being 1, stdin still containing t-3 test cases, `n` still being between 1 and 50 inclusive, `s` still being a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` still being 'ABCDEFG' with at least 2 characters, `hmp` still being a dictionary with character counts from string s, and `i` still being the second character in the string `p`.
