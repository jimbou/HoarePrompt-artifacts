Output State: **t is an integer that must be at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, s is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', ans is 0, p is 'ABCDEFG', hmp is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string s.**

The code reads two lines from stdin for each test case. The first line contains two integers n and m, which are assigned to the variables n and m respectively. The second line contains a string s of n characters from 'A' to 'G', which is assigned to the variable s. The variable ans is initialized to 0, p is assigned the string 'ABCDEFG', and hmp is a dictionary that stores the count of each character in string s. The variable t is not modified by the code, and stdin now contains t-1 test cases.
