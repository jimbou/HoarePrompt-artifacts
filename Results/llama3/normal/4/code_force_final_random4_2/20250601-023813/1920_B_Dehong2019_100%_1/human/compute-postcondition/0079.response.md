Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input and must be greater than 1, `x` is an integer equal to the third input and must be greater than or equal to `k + x - 1`, `a` is a list of integers in descending order equal to the second input, `i` is 1, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in `a` plus `a[0]` plus `a[1]`. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is further updated by subtracting 2 times `a[i + x]`. `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a`, and the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` is being printed. `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that `ans2` is now the maximum of `ans1` and the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a`. This means that `ans2` now holds the maximum value between `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a`, and this maximum value is being printed. All other variables remain unchanged.
