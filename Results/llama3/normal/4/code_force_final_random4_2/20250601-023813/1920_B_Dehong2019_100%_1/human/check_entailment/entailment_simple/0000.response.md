Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for Alice and Bob to play optimally. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n`, the limit on the number of elements Alice can remove `k`, and the limit on the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1 `x`.
3. It then reads the `n` elements of the array and sorts them in descending order.
4. It calculates the sum of the elements in the array `ans1`.
5. It then simulates Bob's move by subtracting twice the sum of the `x` largest elements from `ans1`. This is because Bob will multiply these elements by -1, effectively subtracting twice their value from the sum.
6. It then simulates Alice's move by adding back the `k` largest elements that were removed. However, it also subtracts twice the sum of the `x` largest elements that were not removed, because Bob will multiply these elements by -1.
7. It keeps track of the maximum sum `ans2` that can be achieved by Alice's move.
8. Finally, it prints the maximum sum `ans2` that can be achieved.

The program correctly implements the strategy for Alice and Bob to play optimally, and it handles all possible cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
