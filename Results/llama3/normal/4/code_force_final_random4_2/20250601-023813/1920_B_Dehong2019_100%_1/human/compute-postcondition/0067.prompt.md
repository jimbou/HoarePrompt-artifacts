Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer equal to the first input, k is an integer equal to the second input, x is an integer equal to the third input, a is a list of integers in descending order equal to the second input, i is equal to k, ans1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the maximum of ans1 and the sum of the integers in a minus 2 times the sum of the integers in a is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    ans1 -= a[i] * 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `x` is an integer equal to the third input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order equal to the second input, `i` is equal to `k` and must be 0, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the first integer in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `x` is an integer equal to the third input and must be greater than `k + 1`, `a` is a list of integers in descending order equal to the second input, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the first integer in `a` minus 2 times the (k+1)th integer in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `x` is an integer equal to the third input and must be greater than `k + 2`, `a` is a list of integers in descending order equal to the second input, `i` is equal to `k + 2`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the first integer in `a` minus 2 times the (k+1)th integer in `a` minus 2 times the (k+2)th integer in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
