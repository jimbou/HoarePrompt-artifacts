Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 1, `x` is 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `i` is 1, `ans2` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans2` and `ans1`, `ans1` is increased by the second largest integer in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans1` has increased by the second largest integer in the list `a`, which is in descending order. The other variables remain unchanged. The input stream `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
