Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `x` is an integer equal to the third input and must be greater than or equal to `k + x - 1`, `a` is a list of integers in descending order equal to the second input, `i` is equal to `k + x - 1`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `ans2` has been updated to be equal to `ans1`, which is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` is still being printed.
