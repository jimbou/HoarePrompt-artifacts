The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input and must be greater than 2, `x` is an integer equal to the third input and must be greater than or equal to `k + x - 1`, `a` is a list of integers in descending order equal to the second input, `i` is 2, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in `a` plus `a[0]` plus `a[1]`. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is further updated by subtracting 2 times `a[i + x]`. `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a`, and the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` is being printed. `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**
