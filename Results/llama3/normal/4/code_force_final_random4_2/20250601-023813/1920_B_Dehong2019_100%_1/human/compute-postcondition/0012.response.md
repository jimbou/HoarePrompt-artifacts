Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus `a[0]`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans1` has been updated by adding the first element of the list `a` to it, which is the largest integer in `a` since `a` is in descending order. The other variables remain unchanged.
