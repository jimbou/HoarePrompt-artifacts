Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input and must be greater than 0, `x` is an integer equal to the third input and must be greater than or equal to `k + x - 1`, `a` is a list of integers in descending order equal to the second input, `i` is 0, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in `a` plus `a[0]` minus 2 times `a[i + x]`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` is being printed. The current value of `i` plus `x` is less than `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been updated by subtracting 2 times the value of `a[i + x]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The condition that the current value of `i` plus `x` is less than `n` is still valid.
