Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the largest integer in `a` and minus twice the second largest integer in `a` and minus twice the third largest integer in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been updated by subtracting twice the third largest integer in `a` (since `i` is 2, which corresponds to the third largest integer in the descending order list `a`). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
