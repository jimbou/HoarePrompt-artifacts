The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` subtracts twice the value of the first element in list `a` from `ans1`. Since `a` is a list of integers in descending order, the first element is the largest integer in the list. The value of `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, so subtracting twice the largest integer from this sum results in a new value for `ans1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the largest integer in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0**
