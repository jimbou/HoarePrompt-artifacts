Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input and must be greater than 2, `x` is an integer equal to the third input and must be greater than or equal to `k + x - 1`, `a` is a list of integers in descending order equal to the second input, `i` is 2, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in `a` plus `a[0]` plus `a[1]` plus `a[2]`. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is further updated by subtracting 2 times `a[i + x]`. `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a`, and the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` is being printed. `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: `ans1` has been updated by adding the value of `a[2]` to it, while the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans1` now includes the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in `a` plus `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]`. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is further updated by subtracting 2 times `a[i + x]`. The other variables, including `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, `ans2`, and `stdin`, remain unchanged.
