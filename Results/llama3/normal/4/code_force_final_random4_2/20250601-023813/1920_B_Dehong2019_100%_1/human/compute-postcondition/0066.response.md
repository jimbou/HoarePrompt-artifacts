Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `x` is an integer equal to the third input and must be greater than `k + 2`, `a` is a list of integers in descending order equal to the second input, `i` is equal to `k + 2`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the first integer in `a` minus 2 times the (k+1)th integer in `a` minus 2 times the (k+2)th integer in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still greater than 1, `_` is still 2, `n` is still equal to the first input, `k` is still equal to the second input, `x` is still equal to the third input and greater than `k + 2`, `a` is still a list of integers in descending order equal to the second input, `i` is still equal to `k + 2`, `ans1` is now the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the first integer in `a` minus 2 times the (k+1)th integer in `a` minus 2 times the (k+2)th integer in `a`, and the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` is being printed. The number of test cases in `stdin` has not changed.
