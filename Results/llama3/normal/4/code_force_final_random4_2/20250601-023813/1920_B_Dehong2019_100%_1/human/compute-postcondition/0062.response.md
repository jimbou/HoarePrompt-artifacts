Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `x` is an integer equal to the third input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order equal to the second input, `i` is equal to `k` and must be 0, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the first integer in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been updated to be the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the first integer in `a`, since `i` is equal to `k` and must be 0, which means we are subtracting 2 times the first integer in `a` from `ans1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
