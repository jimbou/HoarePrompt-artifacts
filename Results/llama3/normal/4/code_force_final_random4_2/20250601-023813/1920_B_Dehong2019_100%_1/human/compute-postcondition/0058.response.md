Output: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `i` is `k`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` plus the sum of the integers at indices less than `k` in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers at indices `i + x` less than `n` in `a`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` is being printed**
