Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer equal to the first input, k is an integer equal to the second input, x is an integer equal to the third input, a is a list of integers in descending order equal to the second input, i is equal to k, ans1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the maximum of ans1 and the sum of the integers in a minus 2 times the sum of the integers in a is being printed.**

The first line assigns the values of the first three inputs to `n`, `k`, and `x`, respectively. The second line assigns a list of integers in descending order, equal to the second input, to `a`. The third line assigns the sum of the integers in `a` to `ans1`. The values of `t`, `_`, `i`, and the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` are not affected by the code.
