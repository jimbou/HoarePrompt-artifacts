Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order. If `i` plus `x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus `a[0]` minus twice `a[x]`, and `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`. Otherwise, the values of `ans1` and `ans2` remain unchanged. `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and `i` is 0.***
