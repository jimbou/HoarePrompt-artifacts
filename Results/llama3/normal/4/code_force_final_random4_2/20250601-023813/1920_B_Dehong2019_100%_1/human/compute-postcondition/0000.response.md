Output State: **t is an integer equal to the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, k, and x. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is an integer equal to the number of test cases, which is obtained from the first line of stdin. The rest of the stdin remains unchanged, containing multiple test cases. Each test case still consists of two lines: the first line contains three integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, …, `a_n`.
