Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `x` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `i` is 1, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` plus the first integer in `a` minus 2 times the integer at index `i + x` in `a` if `i + x` is less than `n` plus the integer at index `i` in `a`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `ans1` has been updated by adding the integer at index `i` in `a` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
