Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `i` is 0, `ans2` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans2` and `ans1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `ans2` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `ans1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans2` is now the maximum of the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus `a[0]` minus twice `a[x]`, if `i` plus `x` is less than `n`. Otherwise, the value of `ans2` remains the same.
