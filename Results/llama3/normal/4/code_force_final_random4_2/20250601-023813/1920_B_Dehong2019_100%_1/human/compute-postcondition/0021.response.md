Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 1, `x` is 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `i` is 1, `ans2` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans2` and `ans1`, `ans1` is increased by the second largest integer in `a` minus 2 times the third largest integer in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs if `i + x` is less than `n`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state because the code only updates `ans2` to be the maximum of `ans1` and its previous value, but `ans1` is already increased by the second largest integer in `a` minus 2 times the third largest integer in `a`, so `ans2` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and this new value of `ans1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
