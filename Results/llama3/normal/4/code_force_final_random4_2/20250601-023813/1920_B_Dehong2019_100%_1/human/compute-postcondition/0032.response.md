To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`. The loop will execute if `x` is at least 1. Since `i` is initialized to `k-1` before the loop, we need to adjust `i` to be 0 for the loop to start executing.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `i` is 0, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `ans2` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans2` and `ans1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**
