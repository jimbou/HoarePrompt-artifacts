Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer equal to the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, k, and x. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, â€¦, a_n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)
    ans1 = sum(a)
    for i in range(x):
        ans1 -= a[i] * 2
    ans2 = ans1
    for i in range(k):
        ans1 += a[i]
        if i + x < n:
            ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
        ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)
    print(ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `i` is `k-1`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `ans2` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans2` and `ans1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the maximum value of `ans2` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `i` is `k`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` plus the sum of the integers at indices less than `k` in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers at indices `i + x` less than `n` in `a`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input and must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer equal to the third input and must be greater than or equal to `k + x - 1`, `a` is a list of integers in descending order equal to the second input, `i` is equal to `k`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in `a` plus the sum of the first `k` integers in `a`. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is further updated by subtracting 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index `x` to `k + x - 1`. `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a`, and the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` is being printed. `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
