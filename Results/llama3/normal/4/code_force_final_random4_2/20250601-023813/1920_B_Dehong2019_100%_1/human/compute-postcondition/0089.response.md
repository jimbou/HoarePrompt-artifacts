Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: the number of elements, a threshold value, and a penalty value. The second line contains a list of integers. For each test case, the function sorts the list of integers in descending order, calculates the maximum possible sum by applying a penalty to the first 'x' elements and then adding the next 'k' elements while avoiding the penalty, and prints the maximum sum. The function repeats this process for all test cases and then exits, leaving the standard input empty.**
