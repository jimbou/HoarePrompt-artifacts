The code prints the value of `ans2`, which is the maximum of the previous value of `ans2` and `ans1`. `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`. Since `x` is 0, the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` is 0. Therefore, `ans1` is equal to the sum of the integers in `a`. The previous value of `ans2` is not specified, but since `ans2` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans2` and `ans1`, it will be at least the sum of the integers in `a`. 

Output: **the maximum of the previous value of ans2 and the sum of the integers in a**
