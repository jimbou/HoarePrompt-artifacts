Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `i` is 1, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the first integer in `a` minus 2 times the second integer in `a`, `ans2` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans2` and the new value of `ans1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been updated by subtracting 2 times the second integer in `a` (since `i` is 1). The value of `ans2` remains the maximum of its previous value and the new value of `ans1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
