The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `i` is `k-1`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `ans2` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans2` and `ans1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the maximum value of `ans2` is being printed**
