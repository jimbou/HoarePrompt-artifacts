Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `x` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `i` is 0, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` plus the first integer in `a`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If `i + x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` plus the first integer in `a` minus 2 times the integer at index `i + x` in `a`.***
