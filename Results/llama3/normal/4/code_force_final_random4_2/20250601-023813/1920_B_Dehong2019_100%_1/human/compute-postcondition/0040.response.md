To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1. Since `i` is initially `x`, which must be greater than or equal to 0, we can adjust `i` to be 0, which is a valid value for the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `x` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `i` is 0, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**
