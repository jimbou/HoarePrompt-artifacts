The value of `ans1` is decreased by twice the value of `a[i + x]`. The value of `a[i + x]` is an integer because `a` is a list of integers. The value of `i + x` is less than `n` and `i` is 0, so `x` is less than `n`. The value of `ans1` is updated to be the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus `a[0]` minus twice `a[x]`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus `a[0]` minus twice `a[x]`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0, and the current value of `i` plus `x` is less than `n`.**
