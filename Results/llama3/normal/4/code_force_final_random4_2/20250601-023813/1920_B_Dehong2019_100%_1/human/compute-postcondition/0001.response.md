To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the loop variable `_` (although `_` is a throwaway variable, its value is still determined by the range it iterates over).

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `t` is an integer equal to the number of test cases, we can adjust its state to be greater than 0.

The loop variable `_` will take on the values from 0 to `t-1` during the loop's execution. Therefore, we can adjust its state to be 0, as it will be initialized to this value before the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases**
