Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input and must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer equal to the third input and must be greater than or equal to `k + x - 1`, `a` is a list of integers in descending order equal to the second input, `i` is equal to `k`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in `a` plus the sum of the first `k` integers in `a`. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is further updated by subtracting 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index `x` to `k + x - 1`. `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a`, and the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` is being printed. `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

- The value of `t` remains an integer greater than 1.
- The value of `_` remains 2.
- The value of `n` remains an integer equal to the first input.
- The value of `k` remains an integer equal to the second input and must be greater than or equal to 0.
- The value of `x` remains an integer equal to the third input and must be greater than or equal to `k + x - 1`.
- The value of `a` remains a list of integers in descending order equal to the second input.
- The value of `i` is updated to be equal to `k`.
- The value of `ans1` is updated to be the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in `a` plus the sum of the first `k` integers in `a`. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is further updated by subtracting 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index `x` to `k + x - 1`.
- The value of `ans2` is updated to be the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a`.
- The maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` is being printed.
- `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
