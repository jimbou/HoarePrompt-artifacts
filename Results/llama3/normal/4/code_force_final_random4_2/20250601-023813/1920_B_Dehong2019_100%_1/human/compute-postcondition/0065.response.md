The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, `x` is greater than `k + 1`. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is `k + 2` and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than `k + 2`.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `x` is an integer equal to the third input and must be greater than `k + 2`, `a` is a list of integers in descending order equal to the second input, `i` is equal to `k + 2`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the first integer in `a` minus 2 times the (k+1)th integer in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` is being printed.**
