Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 2, `x` is 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `i` is 2, `ans2` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans2` and `ans1`, `ans1` is increased by the second largest integer in `a` minus 2 times the third largest integer in `a` plus the fourth largest integer in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs if `i + x` is less than `n`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been updated by adding the fourth largest integer in the list `a` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, containing multiple test cases minus 2 inputs if `i + x` is less than `n`.
