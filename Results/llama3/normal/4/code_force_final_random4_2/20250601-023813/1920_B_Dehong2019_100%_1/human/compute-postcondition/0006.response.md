The value of `ans1` is decreased by twice the value of `a[i]`. The value of `a[i]` is the second largest integer in `a` because `a` is a list of integers in descending order and `i` is 1. The value of `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the largest integer in `a`. Therefore, the new value of `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the largest integer in `a` and minus twice the second largest integer in `a`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The value of `i` is still 1. The value of `x` is still greater than 0. The value of `k` is still an integer. The value of `n` is still an integer. The value of `_` is still 0. The value of `t` is still an integer greater than 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the largest integer in `a` and minus twice the second largest integer in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 1**
