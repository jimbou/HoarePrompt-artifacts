Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input and must be greater than 1, `x` is an integer equal to the third input and must be greater than or equal to `k + x - 1`, `a` is a list of integers in descending order equal to the second input, `i` is 1, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in `a` plus `a[0]` plus `a[1]`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans1` has been updated by adding the second element of list `a` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The program is still in the process of printing the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a`.
