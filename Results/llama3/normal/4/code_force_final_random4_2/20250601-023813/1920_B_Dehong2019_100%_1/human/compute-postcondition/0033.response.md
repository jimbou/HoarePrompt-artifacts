Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `i` is 0, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the first integer in `a`, `ans2` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans2` and `ans1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still an integer greater than 1, `_` is still 1, `n` and `k` are still integers, `x` is still an integer greater than 0, `a` is still a list of integers in descending order, `i` is still 0, `ans1` is now the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the first integer in `a`, `ans2` is still the maximum of the previous value of `ans2` and `ans1`, and `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
