Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least three elements, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string, `q` is the next element in `ans`. If `c` is '0' or '?', then `temp` is a set containing the elements ((q + r) % n), ((q - r) % n) and ((q - r) % n). If `c` is '1', then `temp` is a set containing the elements ((q + r) % n), ((q - r) % n) and ((q - r) % n).**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, `c`, and `q` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is in the `temp` set, which now contains an additional element `((q - r) % n)`. The condition for `temp` is still dependent on the value of `c`, but now it contains the element `((q - r) % n)` in both cases.
