Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least one element `x`, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string such that `c` equals '0' or `c` equals '?', `temp` is a set containing one element `(q + r) % n`, `q` is an element in `ans`**

The code adds the element `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. The value of `q` is an element in the set `ans`, and `r` is an integer. The modulus operator `%` ensures that the result of `(q + r) % n` is within the range of 0 to `n-1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
