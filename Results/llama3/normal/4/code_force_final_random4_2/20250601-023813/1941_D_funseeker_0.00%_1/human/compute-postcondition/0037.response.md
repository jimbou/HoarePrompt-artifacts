Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 3 elements from 0 to n-1, `r` is an integer, `q` is the third element in the `ans`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the elements ((0 + r) % n), ((q - r) % n), and (q + r) % n. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing either three, four or five elements: `(r % n)`, `(-r) % n`, `(q + r) % n`, `(q - r) % n`, and/or (q + r) % n.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include the element `(q + r) % n`. The other variables remain unchanged. The set `temp` now contains at least one additional element, and its size has increased by one. The conditions on `c` still apply, and the set `temp` may contain different elements depending on the value of `c`.
