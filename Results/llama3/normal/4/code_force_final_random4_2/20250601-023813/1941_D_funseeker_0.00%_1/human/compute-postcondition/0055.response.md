Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all elements from 0 to n-1 and must have at least 2 elements, `r` is an integer, `q` is the second element in `ans`. If `c` was either '0' or '?', then `temp` was a set containing the elements ((q + r) % n) and ((q - r) % n). If `c` is either '1' or '?', then `temp` now contains the elements ((q + r) % n) and ((q - r) % n). Otherwise, `temp` now contains the element ((q - r) % n) in addition to its previous elements.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, and `r` remain unchanged. The value of `q` is still the second element in `ans`. The set `temp` has been updated to include the element `((q - r) % n)`, in addition to its previous elements, which depended on the value of `c`.
