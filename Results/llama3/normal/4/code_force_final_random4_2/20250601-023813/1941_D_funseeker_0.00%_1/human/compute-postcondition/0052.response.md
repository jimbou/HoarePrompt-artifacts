The only object in the loop head is variable `q` and set `ans`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `ans`.  If the set `ans` has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` has at least 1 element, `q` is the first element in `ans`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the set `ans` must have at least 2 elements and the `q` is the second element in `ans`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all elements from 0 to n-1 and must have at least 2 elements, `r` is an integer, `q` is the second element in `ans`. If `c` was either '0' or '?', then `temp` was a set containing the element ((q + r) % n). If `c` is either '1' or '?', then `temp` now also contains the element ((q - r) % n). Otherwise, no changes were made to `temp`.**
