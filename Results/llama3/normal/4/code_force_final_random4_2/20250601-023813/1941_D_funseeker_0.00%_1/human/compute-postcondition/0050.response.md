Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all elements from 0 to n-1 and must have at least 1 element, `r` is an integer, `q` is the first element in `ans`. The current value of `c` is either '1' or '?'. If `c` was either '0' or '?', then `temp` was a set containing the element ((q + r) % n). Otherwise, no changes were made to `temp`. `temp` now also contains the element ((q - r) % n).**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, and `q` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `c` is still either '1' or '?'. The set `temp` now contains the element ((q - r) % n) in addition to its previous elements.
