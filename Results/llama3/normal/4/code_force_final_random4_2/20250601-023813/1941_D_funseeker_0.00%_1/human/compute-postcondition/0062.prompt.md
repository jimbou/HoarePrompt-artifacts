Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, m is greater than 0, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing all elements from 0 to n-1, r is an integer, q is not the last element in ans, temp is an empty set
Code of the loop:
for q in ans:
    if c == '0' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q + r) % n)
    if c == '1' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q - r) % n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all elements from 0 to n-1 and must have at least 1 element, `r` is an integer, `q` is the first element in `ans`. If `c` was either '0' or '?', then `temp` was a set containing the element ((q + r) % n). If `c` is either '1' or '?', then `temp` now also contains the element ((q - r) % n). Otherwise, no changes were made to `temp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all elements from 0 to n-1 and must have at least 2 elements, `r` is an integer, `q` is the second element in `ans`. `temp` is a set containing the elements ((q + r) % n) and ((q - r) % n) if `c` is either '0', '1', or '?'. Otherwise, `temp` contains the element ((q - r) % n) in addition to its previous elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all elements from 0 to n-1 and must have at least 3 elements, `r` is an integer, `q` is the third element in `ans`. If `c` is either '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the elements ((q + r) % n) and ((q - r) % n). If `c` is '1', `temp` contains the element ((q + r) % n) in addition to its previous elements ((q - r) % n) and now also contains ((q - r) % n) again.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
