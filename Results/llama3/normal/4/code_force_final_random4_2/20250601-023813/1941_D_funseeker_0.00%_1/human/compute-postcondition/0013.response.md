Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least two elements, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string, `q` is the next element in `ans`. If `c` is '0' or '?', then `temp` is a set containing the elements ((q + r) % n) and ((q - r) % n).**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include the new element ((q - r) % n), in addition to the existing element ((q + r) % n) if `c` is '0' or '?'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
