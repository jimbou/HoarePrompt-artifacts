Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly using the defined functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`).

2. It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This set will keep track of the possible players who could have the ball after each throw.

3. The program then iterates over each throw. For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and direction `c`.

4. It creates a temporary set `temp` to store the possible players after the current throw.

5. If the direction is '0' (clockwise) or '?', it adds the player who would receive the ball if thrown clockwise to the `temp` set. If the direction is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?', it adds the player who would receive the ball if thrown counterclockwise to the `temp` set.

6. After processing all throws, the program prints the number of possible players who could have the ball and their numbers.

7. The program handles the case where the player number is 0 by discarding it from the set and adding the total number of players `n` instead.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
