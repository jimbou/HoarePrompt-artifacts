Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all elements from 0 to n-1 and must have at least 3 elements, `r` is an integer, `q` is the third element in `ans`. If `c` is either '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the elements ((q + r) % n) and ((q - r) % n). Otherwise, `temp` contains the element ((q + r) % n) in addition to its previous elements ((q - r) % n).***
