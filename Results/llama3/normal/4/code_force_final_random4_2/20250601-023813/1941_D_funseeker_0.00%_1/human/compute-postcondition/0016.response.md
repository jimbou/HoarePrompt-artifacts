Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least three elements, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string, `q` is the next element in `ans`. If `c` is '1' or '?', then `temp` is a set containing the elements ((q + r) % n) and ((q - r) % n). If `c` is '0', then `temp` is a set containing the elements ((q + r) % n) and ((q - r) % n) because we added ((q + r) % n) to temp.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but with the addition of ((q + r) % n) to the set `temp`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
