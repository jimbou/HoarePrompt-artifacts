Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the possible positions of the ball after a series of throws. 

The program uses a set to keep track of the possible positions of the ball. For each throw, it calculates the new possible positions based on the direction of the throw and the distance. If the direction is unknown ('?'), it considers both clockwise and counterclockwise directions. 

The program also handles the case where the ball is thrown to a position that is equivalent to 0 (i.e., the first position in the circle). In this case, it discards 0 from the set and adds the total number of players (n) to the set, because the first position is equivalent to the nth position in the circle. 

Finally, the program prints the number of possible positions and the positions themselves. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
