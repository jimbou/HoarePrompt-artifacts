Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least one element `x`, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string, `q` is an element in `ans`, `temp` is a set containing at least one element `(q - r) % n`.**

The value of `temp` is updated by adding the result of `(q - r) % n`, where `q` is an element in `ans` and `r` is an integer. The other variables remain unchanged. The state of `c` is either '1' or '?', but it does not affect the execution of the code.
