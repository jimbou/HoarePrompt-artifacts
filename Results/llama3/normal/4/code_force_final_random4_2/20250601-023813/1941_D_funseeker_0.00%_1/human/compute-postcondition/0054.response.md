Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all elements from 0 to n-1 and must have at least 2 elements, `r` is an integer, `q` is the second element in `ans`. If `c` was either '0' or '?', then `temp` was a set containing the element ((q + r) % n). If `c` is either '1' or '?', then `temp` now also contains the element ((q - r) % n). Otherwise, no changes were made to `temp`. Now `temp` also contains the element ((q + r) % n) if `c` is either '0' or '?'.***
