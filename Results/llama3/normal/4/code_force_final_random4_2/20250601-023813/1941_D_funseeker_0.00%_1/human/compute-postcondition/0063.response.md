Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all elements from 0 to n-1, `r` is an integer, `q` is not defined, `temp` is a set containing all elements from 0 to n-1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be equal to `temp`, which is a set containing all elements from 0 to n-1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
