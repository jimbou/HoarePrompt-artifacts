Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is an empty set, `r` is an integer, `q` is the last element in the initial `ans`, `temp` is a set containing all elements from 0 to n-1.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same values for `n`, `m`, `x`, and `r` as in the initial state. The set `ans` will be empty since the loop iterates over all elements in `ans` and removes them. The variable `q` will hold the last element that was processed in the loop. The set `temp` will contain all elements from 0 to n-1, as the loop adds all possible results of the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for all `q` in `ans` to `temp`.
