This function generates a set of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) based on the input parameters n, m, and x, and then prints the size of the set and its elements. If 0 is present in the set, it is replaced with n. The function's output depends on the presence of 0 in the set, resulting in either a set of numbers from 1 to n or the original set elements.
