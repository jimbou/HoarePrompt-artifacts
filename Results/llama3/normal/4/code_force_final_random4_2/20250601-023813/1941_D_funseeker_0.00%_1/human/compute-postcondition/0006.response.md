Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least one element `x`, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string, `q` is an element in `ans`. If `c` equals '0' or `c` equals '?', `temp` is a set containing one element `(q + r) % n`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
