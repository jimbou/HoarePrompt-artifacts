Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least two elements, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string, `q` is the next element in `ans`, `temp` is a set containing the element ((q + r) % n)**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, `c` remain unchanged. The only change is that a new element `(q + r) % n` is added to the set `temp`. The value of `q` is still the next element in `ans`.
