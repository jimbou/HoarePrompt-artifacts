Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 1 element from 0 to n-1, `r` is an integer, `q` is 0. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing either one or two elements: `(r % n)` and/or `(-r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` is a set containing the element ((0 + r) % n).***
