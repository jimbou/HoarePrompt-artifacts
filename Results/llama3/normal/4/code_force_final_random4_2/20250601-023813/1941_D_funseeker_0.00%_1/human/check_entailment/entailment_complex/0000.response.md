Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. It correctly reads the input, processes the throws, and determines the possible positions of the ball after the throws. The program also correctly handles the case where the direction of a throw is unknown ('?') by considering both clockwise and counterclockwise directions. The final output is also correct, as it prints the number of possible positions and the positions themselves.

However, there is a small issue with the program. In the function func_4(), the line `if (0 in ans) :` checks if 0 is in the set ans, and if so, it discards 0 and adds n to the set. This is done to handle the case where the ball ends up at position 0, which is equivalent to position n. However, this check is not necessary, as the program already correctly handles this case by using the modulo operator (`% n`) to ensure that the position of the ball is always within the range [0, n-1]. Therefore, the line `if (0 in ans) :` can be removed without affecting the correctness of the program.

Despite this small issue, the program is overall correct and meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
