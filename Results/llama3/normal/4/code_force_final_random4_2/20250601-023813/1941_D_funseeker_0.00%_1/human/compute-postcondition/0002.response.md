Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is greater than 0, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing x, r is an integer, c is a string, temp is an empty set**

The code snippet executes the following operations:

1. `r, c = func_1().split()`: This line calls the function `func_1()` and splits its return value into two parts, assigning the first part to `r` and the second part to `c`. Since the return value of `func_1()` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of `r` and `c`. However, we can infer that `r` is a string and `c` is also a string.

2. `r = int(r)`: This line converts the string `r` to an integer. Since `r` was previously a string, this operation changes its type to an integer.

3. `temp = set()`: This line creates an empty set and assigns it to the variable `temp`.

The initial state of the variables `n`, `m`, `x`, and `ans` remains unchanged, as they are not modified by the code snippet. The final state of the variables is as follows:

* `n` is still a positive integer.
* `m` is still greater than 0.
* `x` is still a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n.
* `ans` is still a set containing `x`.
* `r` is now an integer, converted from a string.
* `c` is a string, assigned from the return value of `func_1()`.
* `temp` is an empty set, created by the code snippet.
