Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 2 elements from 0 to n-1, `r` is an integer, `q` is the second element in the `ans`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the elements ((0 + r) % n) and ((q - r) % n). If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing either two, three or four elements: `(r % n)`, `(-r) % n`, `(q + r) % n`, and/or `(q - r) % n).***
