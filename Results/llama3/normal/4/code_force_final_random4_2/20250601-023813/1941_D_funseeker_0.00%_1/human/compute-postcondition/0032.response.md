Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 2 elements from 0 to n-1, `r` is an integer, `q` is the second element in the `ans`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing either one, two or three elements: `(r % n)`, `(-r) % n`, and/or `(q + r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` is a set containing either one or two elements: `((0 + r) % n)` and/or `(q + r) % n`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, and `q` remain unchanged. The only change is in the `temp` set, which now includes the element `(q + r) % n`. The size of the `temp` set can be either one, two or three elements depending on the value of `c`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` can contain up to three elements, otherwise it can contain up to two elements.
