Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all elements from 0 to n-1 and must have at least 3 elements, `r` is an integer, `q` is the third element in `ans`. `temp` is a set containing the elements ((q + r) % n) and ((q - r) % n) if `c` is either '0', '1', or '?'. Otherwise, `temp` contains the element ((q + r) % n) in addition to its previous elements ((q - r) % n).**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include the element ((q + r) % n), in addition to its previous elements. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The set `temp` now contains at least two elements: ((q + r) % n) and ((q - r) % n), if `c` is either '0', '1', or '?', or it contains the element ((q + r) % n) in addition to its previous element ((q - r) % n) if `c` is not '0', '1', or '?'.
