Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 1 element from 0 to n-1, `r` is an integer. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the element ((0 + r) % n), otherwise `temp` is an empty set. `q` is 0.***
