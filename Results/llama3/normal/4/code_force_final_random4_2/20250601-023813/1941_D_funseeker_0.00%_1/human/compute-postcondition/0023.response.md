Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is greater than 1, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing all elements from 0 to n-1, r is an integer, c is a string, temp is an empty set**

The code snippet executes as follows:

1. `r, c = func_1().split()`: This line assigns the result of `func_1().split()` to `r` and `c`. Since `func_1()` is not defined in the given code, we assume it returns a string. The `split()` method splits this string into two parts, assigning the first part to `r` and the second part to `c`. The values of `r` and `c` are now strings.

2. `r = int(r)`: This line converts the string value of `r` to an integer using the `int()` function. The value of `r` is now an integer.

3. `temp = set()`: This line assigns an empty set to `temp`. The set `temp` is now empty.

The final state of the variables is:

- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `m` remains greater than 1.
- `x` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n.
- `ans` remains a set containing all elements from 0 to n-1.
- `r` is now an integer.
- `c` is now a string.
- `temp` is now an empty set.

Note that the values of `r` and `c` are now specific values, but we cannot determine their exact values without knowing the output of `func_1()`. Similarly, the value of `n` is still a positive integer, but we cannot determine its exact value without more information.
