Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least one element `x`, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string, `q` is an element in `ans`. The current value of `c` is either '1' or '?'. If `c` equals '1' or `c` equals '?', the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
