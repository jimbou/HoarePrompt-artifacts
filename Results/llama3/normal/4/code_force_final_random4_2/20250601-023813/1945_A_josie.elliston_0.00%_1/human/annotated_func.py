#State of the program right berfore the function call: extroverts and universals are non-negative integers.

            #The program returns None
        #State: *extroverts and universals are non-negative integers. The current value of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, meaning the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 is not 0. The sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is larger than or equal to 3
    #State: extroverts and universals are non-negative integers. If the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 is not 0, then the sum of this remainder and universals is larger than or equal to 3.
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
    #The program returns the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to the average of the sum of extroverts and universals, where extroverts and universals are non-negative integers, and if the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 is not 0, then the sum of this remainder and universals is larger than or equal to 3.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the smallest integer greater than or equal to the average of the sum of extroverts and universals, where extroverts and universals are non-negative integers. If the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 is not 0, it checks if the sum of this remainder and universals is larger than or equal to 3. If this condition is not met, the function returns None. Otherwise, it returns the calculated average.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: introverts, extroverts, and universals are non-negative integers.
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret
    #The program returns either -1 or the sum of introverts and the return value of func_1(extroverts, universals). The return value of func_1(extroverts, universals) is stored in ret. introverts, extroverts, and universals are non-negative integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes three non-negative integers (introverts, extroverts, and universals) as input and returns either -1 or the sum of introverts and the result of another function (func_1) called with extroverts and universals as arguments.
