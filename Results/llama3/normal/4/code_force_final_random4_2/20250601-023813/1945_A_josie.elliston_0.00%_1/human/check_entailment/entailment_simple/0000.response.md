Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes `extroverts` and `universals` as input and returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate them. It first checks if the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3. If it's not, it checks if the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is less than 3. If it is, the function returns `None`, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants. Otherwise, it returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the average of the sum of extroverts and universals.

`func_2` takes `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` as input and returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants. It calls `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments and stores the result in `ret`. If `ret` is `None`, it returns -1, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants. Otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and `ret`.

The program correctly handles the cases where the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3 and the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is less than 3. In these cases, it returns -1, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants.

The program also correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants when it's possible to do so. It takes into account the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, and returns the sum of the number of tents needed to accommodate the introverts and the result of `func_1`.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
