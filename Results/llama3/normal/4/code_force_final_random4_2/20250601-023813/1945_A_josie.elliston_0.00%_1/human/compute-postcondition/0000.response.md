Output State: **`ret` is the return value of `func_1(extroverts, universals)`, introverts, extroverts, and universals are non-negative integers.**

In this output state, the value of `ret` is determined by the return value of the function `func_1` when called with the current values of `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments. The values of `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code.
