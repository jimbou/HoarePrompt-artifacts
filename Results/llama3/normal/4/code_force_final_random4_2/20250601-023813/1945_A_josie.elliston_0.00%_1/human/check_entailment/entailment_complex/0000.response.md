Reasoning: 

The problem requires calculating the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. The given program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_1 calculates the smallest integer greater than or equal to the average of the sum of extroverts and universals. If the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 is not 0, it checks if the sum of this remainder and universals is larger than or equal to 3. If this condition is not met, the function returns None. Otherwise, it returns the calculated average.

func_2 takes three non-negative integers (introverts, extroverts, and universals) as input and returns either -1 or the sum of introverts and the result of func_1 called with extroverts and universals as arguments.

The program correctly handles the cases where the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3 and the number of universals is not sufficient to fill the remaining spots in the tents. In such cases, func_1 returns None, and func_2 returns -1, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the participants according to their preferences.

The program also correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed when the number of extroverts is a multiple of 3 or when there are sufficient universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
