Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` calculates the smallest integer greater than or equal to the average of the sum of extroverts and universals. It also checks if the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 is not 0 and if the sum of this remainder and universals is larger than or equal to 3. If this condition is not met, the function returns None. Otherwise, it returns the calculated average.

`func_2` takes three non-negative integers (introverts, extroverts, and universals) as input and returns either -1 or the sum of introverts and the result of `func_1` called with extroverts and universals as arguments.

The execution summaries of the functions suggest that they are working as expected. The output hints for `func_1` indicate that it correctly calculates the smallest integer greater than or equal to the average of the sum of extroverts and universals, and returns None if the condition is not met. The output hints for `func_2` indicate that it correctly returns either -1 or the sum of introverts and the result of `func_1`.

The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including cases where the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, and cases where the number of universals is not sufficient to accommodate the remaining extroverts. The output of the program matches the expected output for all test cases.

Therefore, based on the execution summaries and the test cases, it can be concluded that the given program is correct and meets the problem description.
