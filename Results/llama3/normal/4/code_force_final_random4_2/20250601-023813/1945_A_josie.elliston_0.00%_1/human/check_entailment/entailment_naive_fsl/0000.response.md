Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the minimum number of tents needed for extroverts and universals, and `func_2` adds the number of introverts to the result of `func_1`.

The logic of the program is as follows:

* For introverts, each one needs a separate tent, so the number of tents needed for introverts is equal to the number of introverts.
* For extroverts, each group of three extroverts needs one tent. If there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents with extroverts, the program returns -1, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the participants.
* For universals, they can fill the remaining spots in the tents with extroverts or occupy separate tents.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the number of extroverts is a multiple of 3, the program correctly calculates the number of tents needed.
* When the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, the program checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents with extroverts. If not, it returns -1.
* When there are no extroverts, the program correctly calculates the number of tents needed for introverts and universals.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
