Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in all cases. The issue lies in the dfs function where it only checks if the disks are tangent to each other but does not consider the case where the disks are not tangent but still overlap. 

For example, consider the case where there are three disks with centers at (0, 0), (3, 0), and (6, 0) and radii 2, 1, and 2 respectively. In this case, the disks are not tangent to each other but still overlap. The program will not correctly handle this case.

Also, the program does not correctly calculate the coefficients for the disks. The coefficients are calculated based on the assumption that the disks are tangent to each other, but this assumption is not always true.

Therefore, the program is not correct and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
