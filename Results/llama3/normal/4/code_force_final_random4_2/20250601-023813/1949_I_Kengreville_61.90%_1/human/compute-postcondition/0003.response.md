Output State: **i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[i] is True, nodes is a list of integers with i appended to the end, x, y, r, coef0, and coef1 are lists of integers of length n, n is greater than 0, j is 0, dx is x[i] - x[j], dy is y[i] - y[j].**

The code snippet calculates the differences in x and y coordinates between the nodes at indices i and j, and assigns these differences to the variables dx and dy, respectively. The values of i, visited, nodes, x, y, r, coef0, coef1, n, and j remain unchanged.
