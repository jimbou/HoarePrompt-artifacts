Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, x is a list of integers of length n, y is a list of integers of length n, r is a list of integers of length n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[0] is True, coef0 is a list of integers of length n where coef0[0] is 0 and coef0[1] is 0, coef1 is a list of integers of length n where coef1[0] is 1 and coef1[1] is 1, nodes is a list of nodes that must not be empty, j is the second node in the nodes, ok is True if c1 is not equal to 0, otherwise it remains False, c0 is 0 + coef0[j] + coef0[j], c1 is 0 + coef1[j] + coef1[j], and i is 1**

The code block modifies the values of `c0` and `c1` by adding the values of `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` to them, respectively. The values of `c0` and `c1` are now the sum of their initial values and the values of `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]`, respectively. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
