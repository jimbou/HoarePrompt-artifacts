Postcondition: **i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[i] is True, nodes is a list of integers with i appended to the end, x, y, r, coef0, and coef1 are lists of integers of length n, n is greater than 0, j is 0, dx is x[i] - x[j], dy is y[i] - y[j]. The current value of j is not visited and the square of the sum of r[i] and r[j] is equal to the sum of the squares of dx and dy.**
