Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where `visited[0]` is `True`, `coef0` is a list of integers of length `n` where `coef0[0]` is 0 and `coef0[2]` is 0, `coef1` is a list of integers of length `n` where `coef1[0]` is 1 and `coef1[2]` is 1, `nodes` is a list of integers of length `n`, `ok` is `True` if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise it remains `False`, `c0` is the sum of all elements in `coef0`, `c1` is the sum of all elements in `coef1`, `i` is 2, and `j` is the last node in `nodes`.**

In this output state, the value of `ok` has been updated to be `True` if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise it remains `False`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
