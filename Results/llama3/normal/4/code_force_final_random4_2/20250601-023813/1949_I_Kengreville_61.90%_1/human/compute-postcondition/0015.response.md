Output State: **i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where all elements are True, nodes is a list of integers with all elements from 0 to n-1 appended to the end, x, y, r, coef0, and coef1 are lists of integers of length n.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable i will be an integer between 0 and n-1 (inclusive), the visited list will have all its elements set to True, the nodes list will contain all integers from 0 to n-1, and the lists x, y, r, coef0, and coef1 will remain unchanged with their initial values.
