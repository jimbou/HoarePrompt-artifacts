Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of False values of length `n`, `coef0` is a list of None values of length `n`, `coef1` is a list of None values of length `n`, `nodes` is an empty list, `ok` is False, `i` is `n-1`, and stdin contains no inputs.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if not visited[i]:
        coef0[i] = 0
        coef1[i] = 1
        nodes = []
        dfs(i)
        c0 = 0
        c1 = 0
        for j in nodes:
            c0 += coef0[j]
            c1 += coef1[j]
        ok = ok or c1 != 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`. If `visited[i]` is False, then `visited[i]` is set to True, `coef0[i]` is set to 0, `coef1[i]` is set to 1, `nodes` is updated to have at least `n` nodes, `ok` is set to True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise it remains False, `c0` is the sum of all `coef0` values in the `nodes` list, `c1` is the sum of all `coef1` values in the `nodes` list, and `i` remains 0. If `visited[i]` is True, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than 0, x is a list of integers of length n, y is a list of integers of length n, r is a list of integers of length n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[0] is True, coef0 is a list of integers of length n where coef0[0] is 0, coef1 is a list of integers of length n where coef1[0] is 1, nodes has at least n nodes, ok is True if c1 is not equal to 0, otherwise it remains False, c0 is the sum of all coef0 values in the nodes list, c1 is the sum of all coef1 values in the nodes list, and i is 1. If visited[i] is False, then visited[i] is set to True, coef0[i] is set to 0, coef1[i] is set to 1, and a new node is added to the nodes list. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than 2, x is a list of integers of length n, y is a list of integers of length n, r is a list of integers of length n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[0] is True, coef0 is a list of integers of length n where coef0[0] is 0, coef1 is a list of integers of length n where coef1[0] is 1, nodes has at least n nodes, ok is True if c1 is not equal to 0, otherwise it remains False, c0 is the sum of all coef0 values in the nodes list, c1 is the sum of all coef1 values in the nodes list, and i is 2. If visited[i] is False, then coef0[2] is 0, coef1[2] is 1, and j is the last node in nodes.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
