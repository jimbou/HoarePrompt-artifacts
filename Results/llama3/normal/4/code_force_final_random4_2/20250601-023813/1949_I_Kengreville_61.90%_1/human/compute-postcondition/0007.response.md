The only variable in the loop head is `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is an integer such that 0 <= j < n. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is an integer such that 1 <= j < n. For the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `j`. 
State: **i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[i] is True. If not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) < d, j is an integer such that 1 <= j < n, n is greater than j**
