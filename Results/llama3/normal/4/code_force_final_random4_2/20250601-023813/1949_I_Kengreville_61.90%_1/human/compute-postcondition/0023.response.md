The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and nodes, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nodes. If nodes is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, nodes is empty, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to nodes is not empty and j is the first node in the nodes.
State: **n is an integer greater than 0, x is a list of integers of length n, y is a list of integers of length n, r is a list of integers of length n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[0] is True, coef0 is a list of integers of length n where coef0[0] is 0 and coef0[1] is 0, coef1 is a list of integers of length n where coef1[0] is 1 and coef1[1] is 1, nodes is a list of nodes that must not be empty, j is the first node in the nodes, ok is True if c1 is not equal to 0, otherwise it remains False, c0 is 0, c1 is 0, and i is 1**
