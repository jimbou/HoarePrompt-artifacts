Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`. If `visited[i]` is False, then `visited[i]` is set to True, `coef0[i]` is set to 0, `coef1[i]` is set to 1, `nodes` is updated to have at least `n` nodes, `ok` is set to True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise it remains False, `c0` is the sum of all `coef0` values in the `nodes` list, `c1` is the sum of all `coef1` values in the `nodes` list, and `i` remains 0. If `visited[i]` is True, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
