Functionality: **This function determines whether a given set of nodes with coordinates and radii can be traversed in a way that satisfies a certain condition. It takes no parameters but reads input from the standard input, expecting a positive integer n followed by n lines of input, each containing three integers representing the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and radius of a node. The function then performs a depth-first search on the nodes, calculating coefficients for each node and checking if the sum of these coefficients is non-zero. If the sum is non-zero, the function prints 'YES', indicating that the nodes can be traversed in a way that satisfies the condition. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**
