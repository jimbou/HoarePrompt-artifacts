Postcondition: ***i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n. If all elements of visited are False, then all elements of visited are set to True, and all integers from 0 to n-1 are appended to the end of nodes. x, y, r, coef0, and coef1 are lists of integers of length n. Otherwise, no changes are made to visited, nodes, x, y, r, coef0, and coef1.***
