Postcondition: ***i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[i] is True. If not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2, then visited[j] is True, nodes is a list of integers with i and j appended to the end, j is not 0, coef0[j] is r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i], and coef1[j] is -coef1[i]. Otherwise, no changes are made to visited, nodes, coef0, or coef1.***
