State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where `visited[0]` is True, `coef0` is a list of integers of length `n` where `coef0[0]` is 0, `coef1` is a list of integers of length `n` where `coef1[0]` is 1, `nodes` has at least `n` nodes, `ok` is True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise it remains False, `c0` is the sum of all `coef0` values in the `nodes` list, `c1` is the sum of all `coef1` values in the `nodes` list, and `i` is 1**
