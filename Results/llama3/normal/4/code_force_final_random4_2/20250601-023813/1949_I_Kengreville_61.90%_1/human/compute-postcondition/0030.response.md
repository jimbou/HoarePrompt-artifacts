Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, x is a list of integers of length n, y is a list of integers of length n, r is a list of integers of length n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[0] is True, coef0 is a list of integers of length n where coef0[0] is 0 and coef0[1] is 0, coef1 is a list of integers of length n where coef1[0] is 1 and coef1[1] is 1, nodes is an empty list, j is the last node in the nodes, ok is True if c1 is not equal to 0 or ok was previously True, otherwise it remains False, c0 is 0 + coef0[j] + coef0[j] + ... + coef0[j] (where j is each node in the nodes), c1 is 0 + coef1[j] + coef1[j] + ... + coef1[j] (where j is each node in the nodes), and i is 1**

In this output state, the value of `ok` has been updated to be True if `c1` is not equal to 0 or if `ok` was previously True. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
