Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, x is a list of integers of length n, y is a list of integers of length n, r is a list of integers of length n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[0] is True, coef0 is a list of integers of length n where coef0[0] is 0 and coef0[2] is 0, coef1 is a list of integers of length n where coef1[0] is 1 and coef1[2] is 1, nodes is a list that must have at least 1 node, ok is True if c1 is not equal to 0, otherwise it remains False, c0 is coef0[j], c1 is coef1[j], i is 2, and j is the first node in nodes.**

The code snippet increments the values of `c0` and `c1` by the values of `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]`, respectively. Since `j` is the first node in `nodes`, the values of `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` are added to `c0` and `c1`, respectively. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, `nodes`, `ok`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
