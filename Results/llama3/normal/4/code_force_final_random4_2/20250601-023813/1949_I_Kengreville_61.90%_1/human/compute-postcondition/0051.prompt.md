You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, x, y, and r are lists of integers of length n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n, coef0 and coef1 are lists of integers of length n, and nodes is a list of integers.
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef0 = [None] * n
    coef1 = [None] * n
    nodes = []
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: n is an integer, x is a list of integers of length n, y is a list of integers of length n, r is a list of integers of length n, visited is a list of False values of length n, coef0 is a list of None values of length n, coef1 is a list of None values of length n, nodes is an empty list, stdin contains no inputs, i is n-1
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef0[i] = 0
            coef1[i] = 1
            nodes = []
            dfs(i)
            c0 = 0
            c1 = 0
            for j in nodes:
                c0 += coef0[j]
                c1 += coef1[j]
            ok = ok or c1 != 0
        
    #State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, x is a list of integers of length n, y is a list of integers of length n, r is a list of integers of length n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where all elements are True, coef0 is a list of integers of length n where all elements are 0, coef1 is a list of integers of length n where all elements are 1, nodes has at least n nodes, ok is True if c1 is not equal to 0, otherwise it remains False, c0 is the sum of all coef0 values in the nodes list, c1 is the sum of all coef1 values in the nodes list, and i is n-1.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, x is a list of integers of length n, y is a list of integers of length n, r is a list of integers of length n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where all elements are True, coef0 is a list of integers of length n where all elements are 0, coef1 is a list of integers of length n where all elements are 1, nodes has at least n nodes, c0 is the sum of all coef0 values in the nodes list, c1 is the sum of all coef1 values in the nodes list, and i is n-1. If c1 is not equal to 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, x is a list of integers of length n, y is a list of integers of length n, r is a list of integers of length n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where all elements are True, coef0 is a list of integers of length n where all elements are 0, coef1 is a list of integers of length n where all elements are 1, nodes has at least n nodes, c0 is the sum of all coef0 values in the nodes list, c1 is the sum of all coef1 values in the nodes list, and i is n-1. The current value of ok is True, which means c1 is not equal to 0, and 'YES' is being printed

Case_2: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, x is a list of integers of length n, y is a list of integers of length n, r is a list of integers of length n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where all elements are True, coef0 is a list of integers of length n where all elements are 0, coef1 is a list of integers of length n where all elements are 1, nodes has at least n nodes, ok is False, c0 is the sum of all coef0 values in the nodes list, c1 is the sum of all coef1 values in the nodes list, and i is n-1, and 'NO' is printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
