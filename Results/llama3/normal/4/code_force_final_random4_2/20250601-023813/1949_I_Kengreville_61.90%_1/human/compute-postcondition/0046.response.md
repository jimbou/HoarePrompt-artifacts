Output: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, x is a list of integers of length n, y is a list of integers of length n, r is a list of integers of length n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where all elements are True, coef0 is a list of integers of length n where all elements are 0, coef1 is a list of integers of length n where all elements are 1, nodes has at least n nodes, c0 is the sum of all coef0 values in the nodes list, c1 is the sum of all coef1 values in the nodes list, and i is n-1. The current value of ok is True, which means c1 is not equal to 0, and 'YES' is being printed**
