The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 2.
State: **n is an integer greater than 2, x is a list of integers of length n, y is a list of integers of length n, r is a list of integers of length n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[0] is True, coef0 is a list of integers of length n where coef0[0] is 0, coef1 is a list of integers of length n where coef1[0] is 1, nodes has at least n nodes, ok is True if c1 is not equal to 0, otherwise it remains False, c0 is the sum of all coef0 values in the nodes list, c1 is the sum of all coef1 values in the nodes list, and i is 2.**
