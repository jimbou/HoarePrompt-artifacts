State: **n is an integer greater than 2, x is a list of integers of length n, y is a list of integers of length n, r is a list of integers of length n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[0] is True, coef0 is a list of integers of length n where coef0[0] is 0 and coef0[2] is 0, coef1 is a list of integers of length n where coef1[0] is 1 and coef1[2] is 1, nodes is a list that must have at least 3 nodes, ok is True if c1 is not equal to 0, otherwise it remains False, c0 is coef0[j] + coef0[j], c1 is coef1[j] + coef1[j], i is 2, and j is the third node in nodes**
