Output State: **i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[i] is True and visited[j] is True, dx is an integer equal to x[i] - x[j], dy is an integer equal to y[i] - y[j], n is greater than j, j is an integer such that 1 <= j < n, coef0[j] is r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i], coef1[j] is -coef1[i].**

The code modifies the values of `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` based on the values of `r[i]`, `r[j]`, `coef0[i]`, and `coef1[i]`. The `dfs(j)` function is called, which implies that the `visited[j]` value is set to `True`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
