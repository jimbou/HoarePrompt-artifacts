Output State: **i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[i] is True, dx is an integer equal to x[i] - x[j], dy is an integer equal to y[i] - y[j], n is greater than j, j is an integer such that 1 <= j < n, if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) < d**

The code snippet calculates the differences in x and y coordinates between two points i and j, assigning these differences to the variables dx and dy, respectively. The values of i, visited, n, j, and the condition (r[i] + r[j]) < d remain unchanged.
