Functionality: **This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a graph, starting from a given node 'i'. If 'i' has not been visited before, it marks 'i' as visited, adds 'i' to the list of nodes, and recursively explores neighboring nodes that are not visited and are at a distance equal to the sum of their radii. The function updates the coefficients (coef0 and coef1) for the neighboring nodes based on the current node's coefficients and radii. If all nodes have been visited, the function returns with the updated lists of visited nodes, nodes, and coefficients. If not all nodes have been visited, the function returns without modifying the input lists.**
