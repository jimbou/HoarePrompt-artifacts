Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[i] is True, nodes is a list of integers with i appended to the end, and x, y, r, coef0, and coef1 are lists of integers of length n.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    dx = x[i] - x[j]
    dy = y[i] - y[j]
    if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
        coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
        coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
        dfs(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[i] is True. If not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j])

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[i] is True. If not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j])

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *dx is the difference between the x-coordinate of i and the x-coordinate of j, dy is the difference between the y-coordinate of i and the y-coordinate of j, i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[i] is True, x is a list of x-coordinates, y is a list of y-coordinates, r is a list of values, n is an integer. If not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j])




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
