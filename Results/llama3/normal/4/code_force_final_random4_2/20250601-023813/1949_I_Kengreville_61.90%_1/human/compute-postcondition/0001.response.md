Output State: **i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[i] is True, nodes is a list of integers with i appended to the end, and x, y, r, coef0, and coef1 are lists of integers of length n.**

In this final state, the value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `visited` is updated such that the element at index `i` is now `True`, indicating that the node at index `i` has been visited. The list `nodes` is extended by appending the value of `i` to the end, effectively adding a new node to the list. The lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `coef0`, and `coef1` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
