Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, x is a list of integers of length n, y is a list of integers of length n, r is a list of integers of length n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[0] is True, coef0 is a list of integers of length n where coef0[0] is 0 and coef0[2] is 0, coef1 is a list of integers of length n where coef1[0] is 1 and coef1[2] is 1, nodes is an empty list, ok is True if c1 is not equal to 0, otherwise it remains False, c0 is 0, c1 is 0, and i is 2.**

The code modifies the values of coef0 and coef1 at index i (which is 2), setting them to 0 and 1, respectively. The dfs function is called with the argument i, but its effect is not specified in the given code snippet, so its impact is not included in the output state. The nodes list is reset to an empty list. The values of c0 and c1 are reset to 0. The value of ok is not directly modified by the code, but it depends on the value of c1, which is now 0. Therefore, ok remains False if c1 is 0, and True otherwise. All other variables remain unchanged.
