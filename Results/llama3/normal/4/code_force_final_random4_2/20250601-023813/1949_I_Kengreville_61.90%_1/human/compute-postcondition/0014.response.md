Postcondition: ***dx is the difference between the x-coordinate of i and the x-coordinate of j, dy is the difference between the y-coordinate of i and the y-coordinate of j, i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[i] is True, x is a list of x-coordinates, y is a list of y-coordinates, r is a list of values, n is an integer. If not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 equals dx ** 2 + dy ** 2, then coef0[j] is r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i] and coef1[j] is -coef1[i].***
