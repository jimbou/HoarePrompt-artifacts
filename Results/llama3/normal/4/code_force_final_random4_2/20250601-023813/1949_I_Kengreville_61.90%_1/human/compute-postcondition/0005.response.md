Output State: **i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[i] is True and visited[j] is True, nodes is a list of integers with i and j appended to the end, x, y, r, coef0, and coef1 are lists of integers of length n, n is greater than 0, j is not 0, dx is x[i] - x[j], dy is y[i] - y[j], coef0[j] is r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i], coef1[j] is -coef1[i].**
