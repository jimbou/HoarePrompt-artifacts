Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of False values of length `n` with `visited[i]` now being True, `coef0` is a list of None values of length `n` with `coef0[i]` now being 0, `coef1` is a list of None values of length `n` with `coef1[i]` now being 1, `nodes` is a list of nodes that must have at least `n` nodes, `j` is the last node in the list, `ok` is True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise it remains False, `i` is 0, `c0` is the sum of all `coef0` values in the `nodes` list, `c1` is the sum of all `coef1` values in the `nodes` list, and stdin contains no inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ok` is updated to True if the sum of all `coef1` values in the `nodes` list (`c1`) is not equal to 0, otherwise it remains False. All other variables remain unchanged.
