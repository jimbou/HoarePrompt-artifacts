To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `nodes`. The loop will execute if `nodes` is not empty.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where `visited[0]` is True, `coef0` is a list of integers of length `n` where `coef0[0]` is 0 and `coef0[2]` is 0, `coef1` is a list of integers of length `n` where `coef1[0]` is 1 and `coef1[2]` is 1, `nodes` is a list that must have at least 1 node, `ok` is True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise it remains False, `c0` is 0, `c1` is 0, `i` is 2, and `j` is the first node in `nodes`**
