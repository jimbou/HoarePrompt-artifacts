The only variable in the loop head is `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is an integer such that 0 <= `i` < `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where `visited[i]` is True, `nodes` is a list of integers with `i` appended to the end, and `x`, `y`, `r`, `coef0`, and `coef1` are lists of integers of length `n`. So for the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than 0 and `j` is 0.

State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= `i` < `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where `visited[i]` is True, `nodes` is a list of integers with `i` appended to the end, `x`, `y`, `r`, `coef0`, and `coef1` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**
