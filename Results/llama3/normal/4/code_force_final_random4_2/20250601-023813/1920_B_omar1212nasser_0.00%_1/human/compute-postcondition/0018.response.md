Output State: **`removals` is at least 1, `i` is 3, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `pos` is a list containing three elements where the first element is the difference between the sum of all elements in 'elements' and twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in 'elements', the second element is `s` decreased by the smallest element in `elements` and then decreased by twice the difference between the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end and the `i`th element from the end in `elements`, and the third element is `s` decreased by twice the difference between the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end and the `i`th element from the end in `elements`, `s` is decreased by the smallest element in `elements` and then decreased by the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end in `elements` and then decreased by the `i`th element from the end in `elements`, and `n` is either increased by the difference between the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end and the `i`th element from the end in `elements` if `negatives + i` is not greater than the length of `elements`, or remains the same if `negatives + i` is out of range**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being the value of `n`. The value of `n` is increased by the difference between the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end and the `i`th element from the end in `elements`, but only if `negatives + i` is within the range of the list `elements`. If `negatives + i` is out of range, the value of `n` remains the same.
