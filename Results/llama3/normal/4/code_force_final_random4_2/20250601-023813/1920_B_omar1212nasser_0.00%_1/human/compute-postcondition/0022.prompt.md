Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: removals is a non-negative integer, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, the pair (removals, negatives) is not equal to (6, 3), pos is a list containing one element which is the difference between the sum of all elements in 'elements' and twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in 'elements'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, removals + 1):
    s -= elements[-i]
    try:
        n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]
    except IndexError:
        n = 0
    pos.append(s - 2 * n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `removals` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `pos` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the difference between the sum of all elements in 'elements' and twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in 'elements', and the second element is `s` decreased by the smallest element in `elements` and then decreased by twice the difference between the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end and the `i`th element from the end in `elements`, `s` is decreased by the smallest element in `elements`, and if `negatives + i` is greater than the length of `elements`, `n` is 0, otherwise `n` is increased by the difference between the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end and the `i`th element from the end in `elements`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `removals` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `pos` is a list containing three elements where the first element is the difference between the sum of all elements in 'elements' and twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in 'elements', the second element is `s` decreased by the smallest element in `elements` and then decreased by twice the difference between the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end and the `i`th element from the end in `elements`, and the third element is `s` decreased by twice the difference between the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end and the `i`th element from the end in `elements`, `s` is decreased by the smallest element in `elements` and then decreased by the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end in `elements`, and `n` is either increased by the difference between the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end and the `i`th element from the end in `elements` if `negatives + i` is not greater than the length of `elements`, or 0 if `negatives + i` is out of range.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `removals` is at least 1, `i` is 3, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `pos` is a list containing four elements where the first element is the difference between the sum of all elements in 'elements' and twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in 'elements', the second element is `s` decreased by the smallest element in `elements` and then decreased by twice the difference between the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end and the `i`th element from the end in `elements`, the third element is `s` decreased by twice the difference between the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end and the `i`th element from the end in `elements`, and the fourth element is `s` decreased by twice the difference between the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end and the `i`th element from the end in `elements` and then decreased by 2 times the difference between the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end and the `i`th element from the end in `elements`, `s` is decreased by the smallest element in `elements` and then decreased by the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end in `elements` and then decreased by the `i`th element from the end in `elements`, and `n` is either increased by the difference between the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end and the `i`th element from the end in `elements` if `negatives + i` is not greater than the length of `elements`, or 0 if `negatives + i` is out of range.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
