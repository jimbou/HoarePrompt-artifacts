An `IndexError` might be triggered at `n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if `negatives + i` is greater than the length of `elements`. If `negatives + i` is not greater than the length of `elements`, the function increases `n` by the difference between the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end and the `i`th element from the end in `elements`. Otherwise, the function sets `n` to 0.

Output State: **`removals` is at least 1, `i` is 3, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `pos` is a list containing three elements where the first element is the difference between the sum of all elements in 'elements' and twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in 'elements', the second element is `s` decreased by the smallest element in `elements` and then decreased by twice the difference between the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end and the `i`th element from the end in `elements`, and the third element is `s` decreased by twice the difference between the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end and the `i`th element from the end in `elements`, `s` is decreased by the smallest element in `elements` and then decreased by the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end in `elements` and then decreased by the `i`th element from the end in `elements`, and `n` is either increased by the difference between the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end and the `i`th element from the end in `elements` if `negatives + i` is not greater than the length of `elements`, or 0 if `negatives + i` is out of range.**
