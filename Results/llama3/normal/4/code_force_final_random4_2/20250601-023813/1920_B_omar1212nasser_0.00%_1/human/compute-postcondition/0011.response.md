Output State: **`removals` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `pos` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the difference between the sum of all elements in 'elements' and twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in 'elements', and the second element is `s` decreased by the smallest element in `elements` and then decreased by twice the difference between the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end and the `i`th element from the end in `elements`, `s` is decreased by the smallest element in `elements` and then decreased by the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end in `elements`, and if `negatives + i` is greater than the length of `elements`, `n` is 0, otherwise `n` is increased by the difference between the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end and the `i`th element from the end in `elements`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` is decreased by the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end in `elements`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
