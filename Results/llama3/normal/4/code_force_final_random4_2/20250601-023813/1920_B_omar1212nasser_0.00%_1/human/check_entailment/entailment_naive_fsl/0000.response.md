Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the `func_2` function, specifically in the line `if removals == 6 and negatives == 3: return 0`. This line is a special case that returns 0 when `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, but it does not consider the actual elements in the array. This means that if the array contains elements that would result in a non-zero sum after the game, the program will incorrectly return 0.

For example, if the input is `n = 6, k = 6, x = 3` and the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, the program will return 0, but the correct answer is 3 (Alice removes the largest 3 elements, and Bob negates the remaining 3 elements, resulting in a sum of 3).

The program should be modified to remove this special case and instead calculate the sum of elements after the game based on the actual elements in the array.
