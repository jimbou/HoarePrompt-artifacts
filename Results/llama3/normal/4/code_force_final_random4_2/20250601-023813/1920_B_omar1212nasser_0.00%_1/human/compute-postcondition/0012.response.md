Output State: **`removals` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `pos` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the difference between the sum of all elements in 'elements' and twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in 'elements', and the second element is `s` decreased by the smallest element in `elements` and then decreased by twice the difference between the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end and the `i`th element from the end in `elements`, `s` is decreased by the smallest element in `elements` and then decreased by the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end in `elements`, and `n` is increased by the difference between the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end and the `i`th element from the end in `elements` if `negatives + i` is not greater than the length of `elements`, otherwise `n` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to include the difference between the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end and the `i`th element from the end in `elements`. If `negatives + i` is greater than the length of `elements`, `n` remains 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
