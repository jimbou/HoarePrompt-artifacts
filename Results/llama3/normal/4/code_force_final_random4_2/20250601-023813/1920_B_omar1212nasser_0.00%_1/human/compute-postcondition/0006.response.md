Output State: **`removals` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `pos` is a list containing one element which is the difference between the sum of all elements in 'elements' and twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in 'elements', `s` is decreased by the smallest element in `elements`, `n` is increased by the difference between the (negatives + i)th element from the end and the ith element from the end in `elements`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of removals is at least 1, the index i is 1, the number of negatives is a non-negative integer, the list of elements is sorted in ascending order, the list pos contains the difference between the sum of all elements and twice the sum of the last negatives elements, the value s is decreased by the smallest element in the list, and the value n is increased by the difference between the (negatives + i)th element from the end and the ith element from the end in the list of elements.
