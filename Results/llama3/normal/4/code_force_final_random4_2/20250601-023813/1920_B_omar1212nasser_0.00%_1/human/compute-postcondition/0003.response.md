The code snippet calculates the sum of all elements in the list, then calculates the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list, and finally appends the difference between the total sum and twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements to the list 'pos'. 

Output State: **removals is a non-negative integer, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, the pair (removals, negatives) is not equal to (6, 3), pos is a list containing one element which is the difference between the sum of all elements in 'elements' and twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in 'elements'.**
