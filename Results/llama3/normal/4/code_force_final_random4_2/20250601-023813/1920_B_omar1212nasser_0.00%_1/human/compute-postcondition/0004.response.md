According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `removals`. If `removals` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `removals` is a non-negative integer, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `removals` is at least 1. The variable `i` is also in the loop head, and it will be initialized to 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`removals` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `pos` is a list containing one element which is the difference between the sum of all elements in 'elements' and twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in 'elements'**
