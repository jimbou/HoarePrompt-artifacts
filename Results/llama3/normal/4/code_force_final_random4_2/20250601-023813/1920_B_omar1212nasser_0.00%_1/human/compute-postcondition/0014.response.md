The `IndexError` exception could be triggered when trying to access `elements[-(negatives + i)]` or `elements[-i]` if `negatives + i` or `i` is greater than the length of `elements`.

The try-except statement accomplishes the following: it attempts to increase `n` by the difference between the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end and the `i`th element from the end in `elements`. If this operation is successful, `n` is updated with the new value. However, if an `IndexError` occurs (i.e., if `negatives + i` or `i` is out of range), the except block is executed, and `n` is assigned the value 0.

Therefore, the output state after the execution of the try-except statement is:

Output State: **`removals` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `pos` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the difference between the sum of all elements in 'elements' and twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in 'elements', and the second element is `s` decreased by the smallest element in `elements` and then decreased by twice the difference between the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end and the `i`th element from the end in `elements`, `s` is decreased by the smallest element in `elements` and then decreased by the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end in `elements`, and `n` is either increased by the difference between the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end and the `i`th element from the end in `elements` if `negatives + i` is not greater than the length of `elements`, or 0 if `negatives + i` is out of range.**
