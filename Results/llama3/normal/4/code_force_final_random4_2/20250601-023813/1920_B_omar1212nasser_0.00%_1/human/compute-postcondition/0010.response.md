To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for i in range(1, removals + 1):`

The objects involved in the loop head are `i` and `removals`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `removals + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `removals` is at least 1.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `removals` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `i` is 2
* `removals` is at least 1 (no change)

The other variables (`negatives`, `elements`, `pos`, `s`, and `n`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`removals` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `pos` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the difference between the sum of all elements in 'elements' and twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in 'elements', and the second element is `s` decreased by the smallest element in `elements` and then decreased by twice the difference between the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end and the `i`th element from the end in `elements`, `s` is decreased by the smallest element in `elements`, and if `negatives + i` is greater than the length of `elements`, `n` is 0, otherwise `n` is increased by the difference between the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end and the `i`th element from the end in `elements`.**
