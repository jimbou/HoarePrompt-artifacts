You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: removals and negatives are non-negative integers, elements is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
    if (removals == 6 and negatives == 3) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: removals and negatives are non-negative integers, elements is a list of integers sorted in ascending order. The pair (removals, negatives) is not equal to (6, 3).
    pos = []
    s = sum(elements)
    n = sum(elements[-negatives:])
    pos.append(s - 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, removals + 1):
        s -= elements[-i]
        
        try:
            n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]
        except IndexError:
            n = 0
        
        pos.append(s - 2 * n)
        
    #State: removals is at least 1, i is removals, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, pos is a list containing removals + 1 elements where the first element is the difference between the sum of all elements in 'elements' and twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in 'elements', and the rest of the elements are s decreased by the smallest element in elements and then decreased by twice the difference between the (negatives + i)th element from the end and the ith element from the end in elements, s is decreased by the sum of the last removals elements in elements, and n is either increased by the sum of the differences between the (negatives + i)th element from the end and the ith element from the end in elements if negatives + i is not greater than the length of elements, or 0 if negatives + i is out of range.
    return max(pos)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list 'pos', which contains 'removals + 1' elements. The first element in 'pos' is the difference between the sum of all elements in 'elements' and twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in 'elements'. The rest of the elements in 'pos' are calculated by decreasing 's' by the smallest element in 'elements' and then decreasing it by twice the difference between the (negatives + i)th element from the end and the ith element from the end in 'elements', where 's' is also decreased by the sum of the last 'removals' elements in 'elements'. Additionally, 'n' is either increased by the sum of the differences between the (negatives + i)th element from the end and the ith element from the end in 'elements' if 'negatives + i' is not greater than the length of 'elements', or 0 if 'negatives + i' is out of range.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value from the list 'pos', which contains 'removals + 1' elements. The first element in 'pos' is the difference between the sum of all elements in 'elements' and twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in 'elements'. The rest of the elements in 'pos' are calculated by decreasing 's' by the smallest element in 'elements' and then decreasing it by twice the difference between the (negatives + i)th element from the end and the ith element from the end in 'elements', where 's' is also decreased by the sum of the last 'removals' elements in 'elements'. Additionally, 'n' is either increased by the sum of the differences between the (negatives + i)th element from the end and the ith element from the end in 'elements' if 'negatives + i' is not greater than the length of 'elements', or 0 if 'negatives + i' is out of range.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
