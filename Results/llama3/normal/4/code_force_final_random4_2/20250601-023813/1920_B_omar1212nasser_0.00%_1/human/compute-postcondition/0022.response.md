Output State: **removals is at least 1, i is removals, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, pos is a list containing removals + 1 elements where the first element is the difference between the sum of all elements in 'elements' and twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in 'elements', and the rest of the elements are s decreased by the smallest element in elements and then decreased by twice the difference between the (negatives + i)th element from the end and the ith element from the end in elements, s is decreased by the sum of the last removals elements in elements, and n is either increased by the sum of the differences between the (negatives + i)th element from the end and the ith element from the end in elements if negatives + i is not greater than the length of elements, or 0 if negatives + i is out of range.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `removals` will be at least 1, and the value of `i` will be equal to `removals`. The value of `negatives` will remain a non-negative integer, and the list `elements` will still be sorted in ascending order. The list `pos` will contain `removals + 1` elements, where the first element is the difference between the sum of all elements in `elements` and twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`, and the rest of the elements are calculated by decreasing `s` by the smallest element in `elements` and then decreasing it by twice the difference between the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end and the `i`th element from the end in `elements`. The value of `s` will be decreased by the sum of the last `removals` elements in `elements`, and the value of `n` will be either increased by the sum of the differences between the `(negatives + i)`th element from the end and the `i`th element from the end in `elements` if `negatives + i` is not greater than the length of `elements`, or 0 if `negatives + i` is out of range.
