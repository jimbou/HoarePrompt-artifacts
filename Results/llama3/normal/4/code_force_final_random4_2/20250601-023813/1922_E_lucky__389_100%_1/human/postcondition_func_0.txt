This function reads an integer from standard input, representing the number of test cases. If the number of test cases is 2, it prints 1 and 0 and returns without any further action. Otherwise, it reads a list of integers from standard input, calculates the base-2 logarithm of each integer plus 1, and stores these values in a list. It then generates a new list containing integers from 0 to the maximum base-2 logarithm minus 1, followed by all the calculated base-2 logarithms except the first one. The function prints the length of this new list, followed by its elements, and finally prints a newline character.
