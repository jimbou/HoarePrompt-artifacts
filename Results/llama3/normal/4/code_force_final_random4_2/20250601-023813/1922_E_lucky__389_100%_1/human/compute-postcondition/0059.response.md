Output State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` contains the base-2 logarithm of the original value of `x` plus 1 and must have at least `len(subseq_lens)` elements, `mx` is the original value of `mx`, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to the original value of `mx` minus 1 and all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, `i` is `len(subseq_lens) - 1`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `x` remains 0, `subseq_lens` still contains the base-2 logarithm of the original value of `x` plus 1 but now must have at least as many elements as its current length, `mx` remains unchanged, `ansv` now includes all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one in addition to the original list of integers from 0 to `mx` minus 1, the input in stdin remains the same, and the loop counter `i` reaches the last index of `subseq_lens`.
