Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `x` is greater than 0, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, and we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, `i` being 0 implies that the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of `x` plus 1 is 0.**
