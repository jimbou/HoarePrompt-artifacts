Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `subseq_lens` is either an empty list or contains the value `-1`, `mx` is either 0 or the maximum of its original value and `-1`, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, and we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of `i` is 0.***
