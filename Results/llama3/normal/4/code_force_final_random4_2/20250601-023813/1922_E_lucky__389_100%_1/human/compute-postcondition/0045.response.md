Output State: **`i` is the smallest integer such that 2 to the power of `i` is greater than `x`, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `subseq_lens` is either an empty list or contains the value `-1`, `mx` is either 0 or the maximum of its original value and `-1`, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, and we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, after the loop finishes executing, the value of `i` will be the smallest integer such that 2 to the power of `i` is greater than `x`. The value of `x` will remain greater than or equal to 1. The state of `subseq_lens` and `mx` will remain unchanged, and stdin will still contain 1 input: a list of integers.
