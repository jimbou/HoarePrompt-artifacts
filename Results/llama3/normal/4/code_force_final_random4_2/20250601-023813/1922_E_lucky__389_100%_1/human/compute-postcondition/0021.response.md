Postcondition: ***`i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(x) + 1, `x` is greater than or equal to 2, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers. If `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(x - 2)***
