According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If 2 to the power of `i` is less than or equal to `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `x` is greater than or equal to 2. `x` being greater than or equal to 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `x` is greater than or equal to 8. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is 2, `x` is greater than or equal to 8, `subseq_lens` is either an empty list or contains the value `-1`, `mx` is either 0 or the maximum of its original value and `-1`, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, and we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
