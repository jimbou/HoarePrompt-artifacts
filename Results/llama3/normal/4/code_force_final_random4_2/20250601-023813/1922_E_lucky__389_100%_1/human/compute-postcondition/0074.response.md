Output: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` contains the base-2 logarithm of the original value of `x` plus 1 and must have at least `len(subseq_lens)` elements, `mx` is the original value of `mx`, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to the original value of `mx` minus 1 and all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one and must have at least `len(ansv)` elements, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, `i` is `len(ansv) - 1`, and all elements of the list `ansv` are printed, and nothing is printed**
