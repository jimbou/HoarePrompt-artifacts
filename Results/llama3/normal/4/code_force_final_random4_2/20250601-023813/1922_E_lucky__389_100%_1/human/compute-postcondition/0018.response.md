Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is greater than or equal to 2, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `i`, `x`, `subseq_lens`, and `mx` do not change. However, the code executes a `break` statement, which means we exit the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The stdin still contains a list of integers as input.
