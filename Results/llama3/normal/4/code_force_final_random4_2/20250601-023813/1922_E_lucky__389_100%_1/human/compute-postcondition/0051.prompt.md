Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, x is an integer and is not equal to 2, subseq_lens is an empty list, mx is 0
Code of the loop:
while x != 0:
    i = 0
    while 2 ** i <= x:
        i += 1
    if i == 0:
        break
    else:
        subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
        x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
        mx = max(mx, i - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(x) + 1, `x` is greater than or equal to 2, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers. If `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(x - 2)
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of `x` plus 1, `x` is greater than 0, `subseq_lens` is either an empty list or contains the value `i - 1`, `mx` is either 0 or the maximum of its original value and `i - 1`, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, and we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, if `i` is 0, then the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of `x` plus 1 is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`i` is the smallest integer such that 2 to the power of `i` is greater than `x`, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `subseq_lens` is either an empty list or contains the value `-1` if `i` is 0, otherwise it contains the value `i - 1`, `mx` is either 0 or the maximum of its original value and `-1` if `i` is 0, otherwise it is the maximum of its original value and `i - 1`, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, and we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
