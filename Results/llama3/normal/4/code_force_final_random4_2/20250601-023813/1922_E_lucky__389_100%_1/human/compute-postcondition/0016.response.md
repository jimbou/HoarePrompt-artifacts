Output State: **`i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(x) + 1, `x` is greater than or equal to 2, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers.**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of `i` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of `x` plus 1. The value of `x` will be greater than or equal to 2, and the values of `subseq_lens` and `mx` will remain unchanged, as an empty list and 0, respectively. The input in stdin will still be a list of integers.
