According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If 2 to the power of `i` is less than or equal to `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is greater than 0. `x` being greater than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `x` is greater than or equal to 2 to the power of 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is 1, `x` is greater than or equal to 2 to the power of 2, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers**
