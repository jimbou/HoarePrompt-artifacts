Output State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` contains the base-2 logarithm of the original value of `x` plus 1 and must have at least 3 elements, `mx` is the original value of `mx`, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to the original value of `mx` minus 1 and the third element of `subseq_lens`, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, `i` is 2**

The value of `ansv` has been updated by appending the third element of `subseq_lens` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains a list of integers. The value of `i` is still 2.
