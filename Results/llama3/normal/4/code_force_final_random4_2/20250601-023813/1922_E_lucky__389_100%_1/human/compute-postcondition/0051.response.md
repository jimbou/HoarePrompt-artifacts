Output State: **x is 0, subseq_lens contains the base-2 logarithm of the original value of x plus 1, mx is the maximum of the original value of mx and the base-2 logarithm of the original value of x plus 1, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable x is 0, the list subseq_lens contains the base-2 logarithm of the original value of x plus 1, the variable mx is the maximum of the original value of mx and the base-2 logarithm of the original value of x plus 1, and stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers.
