Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` contains the base-2 logarithm of the original value of `x` plus 1 and must have at least `len(subseq_lens)` elements, `mx` is the original value of `mx`, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to the original value of `mx` minus 1 and all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, `i` is `len(subseq_lens) - 1`, and the length of `ansv` which is equal to `len(subseq_lens) - 1` is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(ansv)):
    print(ansv[i], end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` contains the base-2 logarithm of the original value of `x` plus 1 and must have at least `len(subseq_lens)` elements, `mx` is the original value of `mx`, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to the original value of `mx` minus 1 and all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one and must have at least 1 element, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, `i` is 0, and the first element of the list `ansv` which is 0 is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` contains the base-2 logarithm of the original value of `x` plus 1 and must have at least `len(subseq_lens)` elements, `mx` is the original value of `mx`, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to the original value of `mx` minus 1 and all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one and must have at least 2 elements, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, `i` is 1, and the 2nd element of the list `ansv` which is 1 is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` contains the base-2 logarithm of the original value of `x` plus 1 and must have at least `len(subseq_lens)` elements, `mx` is the original value of `mx`, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to the original value of `mx` minus 1 and all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one and must have at least 3 elements, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, `i` is 2, and the 3rd element of the list `ansv` which is 2 is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
