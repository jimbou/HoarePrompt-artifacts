The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` was 1, so the new value of `i` is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains 1 input: a list of integers. 

Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is greater than or equal to 2 to the power of 2, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers**
