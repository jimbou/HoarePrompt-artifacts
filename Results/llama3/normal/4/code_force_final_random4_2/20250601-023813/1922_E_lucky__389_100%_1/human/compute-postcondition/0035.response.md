Postcondition: ***`i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of `x` plus 1, `x` is greater than 0, `subseq_lens` is either an empty list or contains the value `i - 1`, `mx` is either 0 or the maximum of its original value and `i - 1`, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, and we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, if `i` is 0, then the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of `x` plus 1 is 0.***
