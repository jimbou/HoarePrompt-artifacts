Postcondition: ***`i` is the smallest integer such that 2 to the power of `i` is greater than `x`, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `subseq_lens` is either an empty list or contains the value `-1`, `mx` is either 0 or the maximum of its original value and `-1`, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, and we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. `i` is not equal to 0***
