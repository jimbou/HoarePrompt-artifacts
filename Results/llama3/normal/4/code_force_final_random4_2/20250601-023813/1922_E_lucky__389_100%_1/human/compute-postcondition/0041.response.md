Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is greater than or equal to 2, `subseq_lens` is either an empty list or contains the value `-1`, `mx` is either 0 or the maximum of its original value and `-1`, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, and we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged, so `x` is still greater than or equal to 2, `subseq_lens` is either an empty list or contains the value `-1`, and `mx` is either 0 or the maximum of its original value and `-1`. The stdin still contains 1 input: a list of integers. Additionally, we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement, which is still a valid condition.
