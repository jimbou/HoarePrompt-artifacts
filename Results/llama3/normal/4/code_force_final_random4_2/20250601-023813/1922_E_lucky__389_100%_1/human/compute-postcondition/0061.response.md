The `print(len(ansv))` statement will print the length of the list `ansv` after the loop has executed all its iterations.

Initially, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to the original value of `mx` minus 1. The loop iterates over all elements of `subseq_lens` and appends them to `ansv`, except for the first element which is not included in the loop.

Since `subseq_lens` contains the base-2 logarithm of the original value of `x` plus 1 and must have at least `len(subseq_lens)` elements, the length of `subseq_lens` is at least 1. The loop iterates over all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one, so it appends `len(subseq_lens) - 1` elements to `ansv`.

Therefore, the final length of `ansv` is the initial length of `ansv` (which is the original value of `mx`) plus the number of elements appended to it in the loop (which is `len(subseq_lens) - 1`).

Output: **mx + len(subseq_lens) - 1**
