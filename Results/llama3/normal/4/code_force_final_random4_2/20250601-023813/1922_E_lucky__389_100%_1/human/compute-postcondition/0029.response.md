Output State: **`i` is less than or equal to 3, `x` is greater than or equal to 2 to the power of 2, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now less than or equal to 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains a list of integers as input.
