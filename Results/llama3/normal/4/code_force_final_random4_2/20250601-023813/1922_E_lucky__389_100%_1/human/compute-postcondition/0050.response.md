Postcondition: ***`i` is the smallest integer such that 2 to the power of `i` is greater than `x`, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `subseq_lens` is either an empty list or contains the value `-1` if `i` is 0, otherwise it contains the value `i - 1`, `mx` is either 0 or the maximum of its original value and `-1` if `i` is 0, otherwise it is the maximum of its original value and `i - 1`, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, and we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
