Output State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` contains the base-2 logarithm of the original value of `x` plus 1 and must have at least 2 elements, `mx` is the original value of `mx`, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to the original value of `mx` minus 1 and the second element of `subseq_lens`, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `x` remains 0, and the value of `mx` also remains the same as its original value. The list `subseq_lens` still contains the base-2 logarithm of the original value of `x` plus 1 and must have at least 2 elements. The list `ansv` now includes the second element of `subseq_lens` in addition to the integers from 0 to the original value of `mx` minus 1. The stdin still contains 1 input: a list of integers, and the value of `i` is still 1.
