You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a list of integers (the values of X for each test case). Each value of X is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^18.
    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if (x == 2) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
        return
        #The program returns nothing because the return statement is empty. The value of x is still 2, subseq_lens is still an empty list, and mx is still 0. The numbers 1 and 0 have been printed.
    #State: *stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, x is an integer and is not equal to 2, subseq_lens is an empty list, mx is 0
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
        
    #State: x is 0, subseq_lens contains the base-2 logarithm of the original value of x plus 1, mx is the maximum of the original value of mx and the base-2 logarithm of the original value of x plus 1, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` contains the base-2 logarithm of the original value of `x` plus 1 and must have at least `len(subseq_lens)` elements, `mx` is the original value of `mx`, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to the original value of `mx` minus 1 and all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, `i` is `len(subseq_lens) - 1`
    #
    #The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except that `ansv` now includes all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one, and `i` is now equal to `len(subseq_lens) - 1`. The loop has iterated over all elements of `subseq_lens` and appended them to `ansv`, except for the first element which is not included in the loop.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: mx + len(subseq_lens) - 1
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` contains the base-2 logarithm of the original value of `x` plus 1 and must have at least `len(subseq_lens)` elements, `mx` is the original value of `mx`, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to the original value of `mx` minus 1 and all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one and must have at least `len(ansv)` elements, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, `i` is `len(ansv) - 1`, and all elements of the list `ansv` are printed
    print()
    #This is printed: a newline character (an empty line)

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing because the return statement is empty. The value of x is still 2, subseq_lens is still an empty list, and mx is still 0. The numbers 1 and 0 have been printed.

Case_2: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` contains the base-2 logarithm of the original value of `x` plus 1 and must have at least `len(subseq_lens)` elements, `mx` is the original value of `mx`, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to the original value of `mx` minus 1 and all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one and must have at least `len(ansv)` elements, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, `i` is `len(ansv) - 1`, and all elements of the list `ansv` are printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
