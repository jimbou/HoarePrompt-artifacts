Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `b` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 2*10^5 inclusive, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is equal to the index of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1 if `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, otherwise `k` is 2 if `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, otherwise `k` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `k` is updated to be the index of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1 if `d[j]` is found in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`. If `d[j]` is not found in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`, the value of `k` remains unchanged. If `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, then `k` is set to 2.
