Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `b` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2*10^5 inclusive, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `k` is equal to the index of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to be equal to the index of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1. The index of `d[j]` in `e` is the position where `d[j]` is found in `e`, and adding 1 to this index gives the new value of `k`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
