The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `b`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `b`. If `j` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `b` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2*10^5 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `b` must be greater than 2.
State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `b` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 2*10^5 inclusive, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then `k` is equal to the index of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1. If `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, then `k` is 2. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.**
