Postcondition: ***a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains a-2 test cases if k equals c or j equals b - 1, otherwise stdin contains a-1 test cases, b is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 0, j is 0, and k is 1 if k equals c or j equals b - 1, otherwise k is the index of the character at index j in string d in the string e plus 1 if d[j] is in e[k:], otherwise k is equal to j.***
