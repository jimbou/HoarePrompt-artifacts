Postcondition: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `b` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2*10^5 inclusive, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is equal to the index of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1. The current value of `k` is equal to `c` or the current value of `j` is equal to `b - 1`.**
