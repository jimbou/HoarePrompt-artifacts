Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains a-1 test cases, b is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 0, k is 0**

In this output state, the value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1, as one test case has been processed. The values of `b` and `c` are assigned the two integers from the input, which are between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive. The values of `d` and `e` are assigned the two binary strings from the input, with lengths `b` and `c`, respectively. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `k` is assigned 0.
