The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `b`. If `j` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1.
State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains a-2 test cases if k equals c or j equals b - 1, otherwise stdin contains a-1 test cases, b is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 0, j is 1, and k is 1 if k equals c or j equals b - 1, otherwise k is the index of the character at index j in string d in the string e plus 1 if d[j] is in e[k:], otherwise k is equal to j**
