Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains 0 test cases, b is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 2*10^5 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is a, j is b, k is b, and the value of k which is equal to b is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing all the test cases provided in the input. The value of `i` is equal to the initial value of `a`, indicating that the loop has iterated `a` times. The values of `j` and `k` are equal to `b`, indicating that the inner loop has finished executing for the last test case. The input buffer is empty, as all test cases have been processed.
