According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0, `k` is 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `stdin` contains `a-1` test cases, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`. For the loop to be executed, `b` must be greater than 0 and `j` is 0.
State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `stdin` contains `a-1` test cases, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `k` is 0**
