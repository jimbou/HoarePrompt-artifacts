To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `j` and the integer `b`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `b`. If `b` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is `b`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is 0 and `b` must be greater than 0.

State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `b` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2*10^5 inclusive, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 0**
