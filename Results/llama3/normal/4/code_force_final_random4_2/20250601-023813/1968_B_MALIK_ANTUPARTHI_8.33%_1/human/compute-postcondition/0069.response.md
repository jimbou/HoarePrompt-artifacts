Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `b` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2*10^5 inclusive, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then `k` is equal to the index of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1. If `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, then `k` is 2. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.***
