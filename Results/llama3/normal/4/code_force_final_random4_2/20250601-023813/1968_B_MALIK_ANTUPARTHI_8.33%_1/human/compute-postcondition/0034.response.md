Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `b` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2*10^5 inclusive, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0. If the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1 equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, then `k` is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
