The code snippet consists of two lines: `k = j` and `break`. The first line assigns the value of `j` to `k`, and the second line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables.

The initial state provides the following information:

* `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive
* `b` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2*10^5 inclusive
* `c` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive
* `d` is a binary string of length `b`
* `e` is a binary string of length `c`
* `i` is 1
* `j` is 3
* `k` is 2 or 3

After executing the code, the only change is that `k` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, b is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2*10^5 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 1, j is 3, k is 3**
