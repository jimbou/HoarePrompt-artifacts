The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `b` and `c`. Since `b` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 2*10^5 inclusive, and `c` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `b` and `c` become the input values. The second line assigns the binary string value of the input to `d`. Since `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `d` becomes the input binary string of length `b`. The third line assigns the binary string value of the input to `e`. Since `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `e` becomes the input binary string of length `c`. The fourth line assigns the value of 0 to `k`. Since `k` is `b`, `k` becomes 0.

Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, b is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 2*10^5 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 2, j is b, k is 0**
