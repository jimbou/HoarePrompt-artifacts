Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `b` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2*10^5 inclusive, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is the index of the first occurrence of `d[2]` in `e` plus 1**.

In natural language, the output state is: `a` is still an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `b` is still an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2*10^5 inclusive, `c` is still an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `d` is still a binary string of length `b`, `e` is still a binary string of length `c`, `i` is still 1, `j` is still 2. A new variable `k` is introduced, which is the index of the first occurrence of the second character of `d` in `e` plus 1.
