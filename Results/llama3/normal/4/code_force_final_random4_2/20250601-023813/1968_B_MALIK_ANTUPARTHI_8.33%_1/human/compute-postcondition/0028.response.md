Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, b is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 1, j is b-1, k is 0, stdin contains 2 test cases**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged from the initial state. The only change is that `k` is now 0, and `stdin` contains 2 test cases.
