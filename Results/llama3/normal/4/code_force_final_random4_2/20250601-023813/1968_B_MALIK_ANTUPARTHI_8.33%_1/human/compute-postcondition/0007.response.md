Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains a-2 test cases, b is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 0, j is 0, and k is 1.**

The first line assigns the value of `j + 1` to `k`. Since `j` is 0, `k` becomes 1. The second line breaks the loop, but since there is no loop in the given code snippet, it doesn't have any effect. No other variables are affected.
