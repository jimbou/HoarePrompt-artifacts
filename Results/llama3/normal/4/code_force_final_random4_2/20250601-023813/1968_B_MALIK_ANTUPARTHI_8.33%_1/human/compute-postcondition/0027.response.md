To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(a):`. This means that the only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `a` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `stdin` contains 0 test cases, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `i` is 1, `j` is `b-1`, and `k` is either `b` or `c` depending on whether `d[j]` is in `e[k:]` or not**
