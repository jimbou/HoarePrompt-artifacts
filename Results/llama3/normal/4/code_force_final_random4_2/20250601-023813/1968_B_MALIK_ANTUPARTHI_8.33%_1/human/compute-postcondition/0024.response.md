Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains 0 test cases, b is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 0, j is b-1, and k is either b or c depending on whether d[j] is in e[k:] or not.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over the entire string d, and the variable j has reached the end of the string. The value of k depends on whether the last character of d is found in the remaining part of string e. If it is, then k is equal to the length of string d (b). If it is not, then k is equal to the length of string e (c). The other variables remain unchanged.
