To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(a):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

The value of `a` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `j`, and `k` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `b` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 2*10^5 inclusive, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `i` is 2, `j` is `b`, `k` is `b`**
