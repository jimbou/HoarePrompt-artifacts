Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, b is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2*10^5 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 1, j is 3, k is the index of the substring d[j] in string e plus 1.**

In this output state, the value of k is now the index of the substring d[j] in string e plus 1. The index is calculated using the index() method of the string e, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring d[j] in e. The value of k is then incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
