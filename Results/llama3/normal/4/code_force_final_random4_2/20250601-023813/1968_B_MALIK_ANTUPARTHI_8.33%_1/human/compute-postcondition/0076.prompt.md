Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, b is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 2*10^5 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 2, j is b, k is 0
Code of the loop:
for j in range(b):
    if d[j] in e[k:]:
        k = e.index(d[j]) + 1
        if k == c or j == b - 1:
            k = j + 1
            break
    else:
        k = j
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `b` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2*10^5 inclusive, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`. If the character at index `j` of string `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`, then if the index of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1 equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `k` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are updated based on the conditions in the else part. If the character at index `j` of string `d` is not present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`, then `i`, `j`, and `k` are updated based on the conditions in the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `b` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2*10^5 inclusive, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then `k` is equal to the index of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1. If `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, then `k` is 2. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `b` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 2*10^5 inclusive, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, `k` is `j + 1`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is 2. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
