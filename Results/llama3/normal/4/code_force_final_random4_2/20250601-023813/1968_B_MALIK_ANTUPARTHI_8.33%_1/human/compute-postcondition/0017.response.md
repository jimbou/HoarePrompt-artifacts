Postcondition: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, b is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 0, j is 1, and k is either 1 or 2 depending on whether d[j] is in e[k:] or not. If k equals c or j equals b - 1, k is 1 or 2. Otherwise, k is the index of the character at index j in string d in the string e plus 1 if d[j] is in e[k:], otherwise k is equal to j.**
