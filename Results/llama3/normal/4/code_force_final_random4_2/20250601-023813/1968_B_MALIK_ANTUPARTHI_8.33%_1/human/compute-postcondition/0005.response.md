Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `stdin` contains `a-1` test cases, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `k` is the index of the character at index `j` in string `d` in the string `e` plus 1.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to be the index of the character at index `j` in string `d` in the string `e` plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the character at index `j` in string `d` is still found in the substring of `e` starting from index `k-1`, but now `k` points to the next character in `e`.
