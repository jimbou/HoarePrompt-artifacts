Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `b` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 2*10^5 inclusive, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, if `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, then `k` is `j + 1`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.***
