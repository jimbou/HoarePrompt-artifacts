Postcondition: ***a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, b is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 0, j is 2. If d[j] is in e[k:], then if k equals c or j equals b - 1, k is 3, otherwise no changes are made to the variables. If d[j] is not in e[k:], then k is 2.***
