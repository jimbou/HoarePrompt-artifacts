Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, b is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2*10^5 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 2, j is 0, k is 0. The character at index j of string d is not present in the substring of e starting from index k**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `k = j` and `break`. The first line assigns the value of `j` to `k`, making `k` equal to 0. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop or switch statement in the provided code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect.

As a result, the only change to the initial state is that `k` is now equal to 0, which was already the case in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
