Postcondition: ***a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, b is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2*10^5 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 1, j is 3. If k is equal to c or j is equal to b - 1, then k is 4. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
