Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `b` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2*10^5 inclusive, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`. If the index of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1 equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, then `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `k` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are updated based on the conditions in the else part.***
