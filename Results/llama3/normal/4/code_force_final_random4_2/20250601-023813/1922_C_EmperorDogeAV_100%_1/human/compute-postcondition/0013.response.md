Postcondition: ***`cities` is a list of non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(cities) and n is greater than 1, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers where the value at index `i` is either 1 or the absolute difference between the city at index `i` and the city at index `i+1`. The current value of `i` is less than n-1, the current value of `forward` is equal to the value of the city at index `i+1`, if the current value of `i` is greater than 0, the current value of `back` is equal to the value of the city at index `i-1`, otherwise the current value of `back` is -99999999999999999999. If the absolute difference between the current value of `forward` and the value of the city at index `i` is less than the absolute difference between the value of the city at index `i` and the current value of `back`, then the value at index `i` in `prog_cities` is 1. Otherwise, the value at index `i` in `prog_cities` is the absolute difference between the city at index `i` and the city at index `i+1`.***
