Output State: **cities is a list of non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(cities) and n is greater than 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers where the value at index i is either 1 or the absolute difference between the city at index i and the city at index i+1, i is less than n-1, forward is equal to the value of the city at index i+1, back is -99999999999999999999.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `back` and `forward`. The first line assigns a very large negative value to `back`, and the second line assigns a very large positive value to `forward`. The values of `cities`, `n`, `prog_cities`, and `i` remain unchanged.
