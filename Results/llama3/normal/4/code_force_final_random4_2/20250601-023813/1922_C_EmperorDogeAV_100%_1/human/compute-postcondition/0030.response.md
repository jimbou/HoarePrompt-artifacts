Output State: **`cities` is a list of non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(cities) and n is greater than 3, `prog_cities[i]` is the absolute difference between the city at index i+1 and the city at index i, if i is less than n-1, then if i is greater than 0, `back` is the city at index n-1 and `forward` is the city at index i+1, otherwise, `back` is -99999999999999999999 and `forward` is the city at index i+1, if i is not less than n-1, then the state of `back` and `forward` is not changed.**

In this output state, the value of `prog_cities[i]` has been updated to be the absolute difference between the city at index `i+1` and the city at index `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The state of `back` and `forward` is still dependent on the value of `i` and `n`.
