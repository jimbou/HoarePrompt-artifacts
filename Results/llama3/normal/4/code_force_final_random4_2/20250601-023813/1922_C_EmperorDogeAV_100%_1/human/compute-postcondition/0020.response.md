Output State: **cities is a list of non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(cities) and n is greater than 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers where the value at index i is 1 and the value at other indices j is either 1 or the absolute difference between the city at index j and the city at index j+1, if i is less than n-1, forward is equal to the value of the city at index i+1 and back is equal to the value of the city at index i-1. If i is 0, the value of back is -99999999999999999999. If i is not less than n-1, no changes are made.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of cities remains unchanged, the value of n remains the same, and the list of progressive cities is updated such that the value at index i is now 1, while the values at other indices remain either 1 or the absolute difference between adjacent cities. The values of forward and back are updated accordingly based on the index i.
