Output State: **cities is a list of non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(cities) and n is greater than 1, prog_cities is a list of n-1 zeros, the current value of i is greater than 0, back is equal to the value of the city at index i-1, and forward is 999999999999999999.**

In this output state, the value of `back` has been updated to the value of the city at index `i-1` in the `cities` list. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `back` is now a non-negative integer, as it is equal to a value in the `cities` list, which contains only non-negative integers.
