Output State: **cities is a list of non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(cities), prog_cities is a list of n-1 zeros.**

In this output state, the variable `prog_cities` has been assigned a list of `n-1` zeros, where `n` is a non-negative integer less than the length of the `cities` list. The values of the `cities` list and the `n` variable remain unchanged.
