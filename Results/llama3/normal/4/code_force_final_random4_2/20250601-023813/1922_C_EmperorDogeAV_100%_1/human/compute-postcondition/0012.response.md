Output State: **cities is a list of non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(cities) and n is greater than 1, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers where the ith element is the absolute difference between the city at index i and the city at index i+1, If the current value of i is less than n-1, then the current value of forward is equal to the value of the city at index i+1. If the current value of i is greater than or equal to n-1, then the current value of forward is 999999999999999999. If the current value of i is greater than 0, then the current value of back is equal to the value of the city at index i-1, otherwise the current value of back is -99999999999999999999. The absolute difference between the current city and the forward city is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between the current city and the backward city.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of cities remains unchanged, and the value of n also remains the same. The list prog_cities now contains the absolute difference between each city and the next city in the list. The values of forward and back are still dependent on the current index i, and the condition that the absolute difference between the current city and the forward city is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between the current city and the backward city still holds.
