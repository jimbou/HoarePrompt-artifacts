Postcondition: ***cities is a list of non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(cities) and n is greater than 1, prog_cities is a list of n-1 zeros. The current value of i is less than n-1, the current value of forward is equal to the value of the city at index i+1. If the current value of i is greater than 0, the current value of back is equal to the value of the city at index i-1, otherwise the current value of back is -99999999999999999999. The absolute difference between the current value of forward and the value of the city at index i is less than the absolute difference between the value of the city at index i and the current value of back.***
