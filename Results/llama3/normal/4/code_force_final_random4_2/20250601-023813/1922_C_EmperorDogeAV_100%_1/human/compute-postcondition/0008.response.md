Postcondition: ***cities is a list of non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(cities) and n is greater than 1, prog_cities is a list of n-1 zeros. If the current value of i is less than n-1, then the current value of forward is equal to the value of the city at index i+1. If the current value of i is greater than or equal to n-1, then the current value of forward is 999999999999999999. If the current value of i is greater than 0, then the current value of back is equal to the value of the city at index i-1, otherwise the current value of back is -99999999999999999999.***
