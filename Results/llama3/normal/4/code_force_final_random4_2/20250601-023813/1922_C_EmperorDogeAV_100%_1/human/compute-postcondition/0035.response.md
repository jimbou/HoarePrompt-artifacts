Functionality: This function takes a list of non-negative integers in ascending order and an integer n as input, where n is a non-negative integer less than the length of the list. It calculates the minimum absolute difference between each city and its adjacent cities, and returns a list of n-1 integers representing these differences. If the difference between a city and its next adjacent city is less than the difference between the city and its previous adjacent city, the function returns 1 for that city; otherwise, it returns the absolute difference between the city and its next adjacent city. The function effectively determines the minimum absolute difference between each city and its adjacent cities, and returns a list of these differences.
