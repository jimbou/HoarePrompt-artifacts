Output State: **cities is a list of non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(cities) and n is greater than or equal to 0, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers where the value at index i is either 1 or the absolute difference between the city at index i and the city at index i+1. If i is less than n-1, forward is equal to the value of the city at index i+1 and back is equal to the value of the city at index i-1. If i is 0, the value of back is -99999999999999999999. The value at index i in prog_cities is determined by the minimum absolute difference between the city at index i and its adjacent cities.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list of cities remains unchanged, the value of n remains unchanged, and the list of prog_cities is updated such that each element at index i is either 1 or the absolute difference between the city at index i and the city at index i+1. The values of forward and back are updated accordingly based on the value of i. The value at index i in prog_cities is determined by the minimum absolute difference between the city at index i and its adjacent cities.
