Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities. The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of cities, the coordinates of the cities, and the number of queries. For each query, it reads the source and destination cities.

The program uses two functions, `func_1` and the main function. The `func_1` function calculates the minimum cost to travel from each city to the next city. It does this by comparing the distance to the previous city and the next city, and choosing the smaller one. If the next city is closer, it sets the cost to 1, otherwise it sets the cost to the distance to the next city.

The main function first calls `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost to travel from each city to the next city in the forward direction. It then reverses the list of cities and calls `func_1` again to calculate the minimum cost to travel from each city to the next city in the backward direction.

The main function then calculates the prefix sum of the forward and backward costs. The prefix sum is an array where each element is the sum of all elements up to that point in the original array.

Finally, for each query, the program checks if the source city is less than the destination city. If it is, it calculates the minimum cost to travel from the source city to the destination city by subtracting the prefix sum of the forward costs at the source city from the prefix sum of the forward costs at the destination city. If the source city is not less than the destination city, it calculates the minimum cost to travel from the source city to the destination city by subtracting the prefix sum of the backward costs at the source city from the prefix sum of the backward costs at the destination city.

The program then prints the minimum cost to travel from the source city to the destination city for each query.

Correctness: **True**
