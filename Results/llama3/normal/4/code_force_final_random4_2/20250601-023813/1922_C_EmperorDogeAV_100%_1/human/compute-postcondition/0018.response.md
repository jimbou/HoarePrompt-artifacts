Output State: **cities is a list of non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(cities) and n is greater than 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers where the value at index i is either 1 or the absolute difference between the city at index i and the city at index i+1, i is less than n-1. forward is equal to the value of the city at index i+1 and back is equal to the value of the city at index i-1. If i is 0, the value of back is -99999999999999999999.**

In this output state, the value of the variable "forward" has been updated to be equal to the value of the city at index i+1 in the list "cities". The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list "cities" is still a list of non-negative integers in ascending order, and the list "prog_cities" still contains n-1 integers where each value is either 1 or the absolute difference between the city at index i and the city at index i+1. The value of "n" is still a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(cities) and n is greater than 2. The value of "i" is still less than n-1. The value of "back" is still equal to the value of the city at index i-1, and if i is 0, the value of "back" is still -99999999999999999999.
