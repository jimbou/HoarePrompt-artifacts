Postcondition: ***cities is a list of non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(cities) and n is greater than 1, prog_cities is a list of n-1 zeros. If the current value of i is greater than 0, then back is equal to the value of the city at index i-1, otherwise back is -99999999999999999999. The value of forward is always 999999999999999999.***
