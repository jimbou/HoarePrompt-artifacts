Output State: **cities is a list of non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(cities) and n is greater than 3, if i is greater than 0, back is the city at index n-1 and forward is the city at index i+1, otherwise, back is -99999999999999999999 and forward is the city at index i+1.**

In this output state, the value of `forward` has been updated to be the city at index `i+1` in the `cities` list. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. Note that the value of `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but it is implied that `i` is greater than 0, since `n` is greater than 3 and `i` is used to access the city at index `i+1`.
