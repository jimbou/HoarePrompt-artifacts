Output State: **cities is a list of non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(cities) and n is greater than 3, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers where the value at index i is either 1 or the absolute difference between the city at index i and the city at index i+1, back is -99999999999999999999, forward is 999999999999999999.**

The code snippet assigns new values to the variables `back` and `forward`, but does not modify the lists `cities` and `prog_cities`, or the integer `n`. The value of `back` is set to -99999999999999999999, and the value of `forward` is set to 999999999999999999. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
