Output State: **cities is a list of non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer such that 4 <= n < len(cities), prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers where the value at index i is either 1 or the absolute difference between the city at index i and the city at index i+1, back is the city at index n-1, forward is 999999999999999999.**

In this output state, the value of `back` has been updated to the city at index `n-1` in the `cities` list, while the values of the other variables remain the same. The precondition that `n` is greater than 3 is still valid, and the `cities` list and `prog_cities` list maintain their original properties.
