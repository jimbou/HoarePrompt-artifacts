#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(cities).
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        
        forward = 999999999999999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1

    #State: cities is a list of non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(cities) and n is greater than or equal to 0, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers where the value at index i is either 1 or the absolute difference between the city at index i and the city at index i+1. If i is less than n-1, forward is equal to the value of the city at index i+1 and back is equal to the value of the city at index i-1. If i is 0, the value of back is -99999999999999999999. The value at index i in prog_cities is determined by the minimum absolute difference between the city at index i and its adjacent cities.
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns a list of n-1 integers, where each integer is either 1 or the absolute difference between two adjacent cities in the list 'cities', and these integers are determined by the minimum absolute difference between each city and its adjacent cities.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function takes a list of non-negative integers in ascending order and an integer n as input, where n is a non-negative integer less than the length of the list. It calculates the minimum absolute difference between each city and its adjacent cities, and returns a list of n-1 integers representing these differences. If the difference between a city and its next adjacent city is less than the difference between the city and its previous adjacent city, the function returns 1 for that city; otherwise, it returns the absolute difference between the city and its next adjacent city. The function effectively determines the minimum absolute difference between each city and its adjacent cities, and returns a list of these differences.
