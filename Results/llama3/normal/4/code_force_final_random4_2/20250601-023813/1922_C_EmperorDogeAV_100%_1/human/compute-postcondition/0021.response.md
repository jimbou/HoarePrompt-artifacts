Output State: **cities is a list of non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(cities) and n is greater than 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers where the value at index i is the absolute difference between the city at index i+1 and the city at index i, forward is equal to the value of the city at index i+1 and back is equal to the value of the city at index i-1. If i is 0, the value of back is -99999999999999999999. If i is not less than n-1, no changes are made.**

In this output state, the value of prog_cities[i] has been updated to be the absolute difference between the city at index i+1 and the city at index i. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of forward and back also remains the same as they were not changed by the code.
