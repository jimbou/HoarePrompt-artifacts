Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of coins needed to travel between cities. The program first calculates the minimum absolute difference between each city and its adjacent cities, and then uses these differences to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to travel between any two cities.

The program correctly implements the logic of the problem. It first calculates the minimum absolute difference between each city and its adjacent cities, and stores these differences in the `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` lists. It then calculates the prefix sum of these differences, which represents the minimum number of coins needed to travel from the first city to each city.

The program then uses these prefix sums to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to travel between any two cities. If the destination city is to the right of the source city, it subtracts the prefix sum of the source city from the prefix sum of the destination city. If the destination city is to the left of the source city, it subtracts the prefix sum of the source city from the prefix sum of the destination city, but uses the `backward_cities` list instead of the `forward_cities` list.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the source and destination cities are the same, or when the source city is the first city and the destination city is the last city.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
