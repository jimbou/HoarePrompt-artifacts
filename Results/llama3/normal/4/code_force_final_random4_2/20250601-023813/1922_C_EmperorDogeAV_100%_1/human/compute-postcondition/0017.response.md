Postcondition: ***cities is a list of non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(cities) and n is greater than 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers where the value at index i is either 1 or the absolute difference between the city at index i and the city at index i+1, i is less than n-1. If i > 0, forward is equal to the value of the city at index i+1 and back is equal to the value of the city at index i-1. If i is 0, the value of back is -99999999999999999999.***
