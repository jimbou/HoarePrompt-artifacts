Output State: **cities is a list of non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(cities) and n is greater than 1, prog_cities is a list of n-1 zeros, i is 0, back is -99999999999999999999, forward is 999999999999999999**

The code assigns extremely large negative and positive values to the variables `back` and `forward`, respectively. These assignments do not affect the values of `cities`, `n`, `prog_cities`, or `i`, which remain unchanged.
