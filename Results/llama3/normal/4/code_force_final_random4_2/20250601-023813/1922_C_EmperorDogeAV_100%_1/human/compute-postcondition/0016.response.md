Output State: **cities is a list of non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(cities) and n is greater than 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers where the value at index i is either 1 or the absolute difference between the city at index i and the city at index i+1, i is less than n-1, forward is equal to the value of the city at index i+1, back is equal to the value of the city at index i-1.**

In this output state, the value of back has been updated to be equal to the value of the city at index i-1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged.
