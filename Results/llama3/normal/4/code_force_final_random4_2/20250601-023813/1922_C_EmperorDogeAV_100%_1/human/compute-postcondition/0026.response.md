Postcondition: ***cities is a list of non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(cities) and n is greater than 3. If i is greater than 0, back is the city at index n-1 and forward is 999999999999999999. Otherwise, back is -99999999999999999999 and forward is 999999999999999999.***
