Output State: **`cities` is a list of non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(cities) and n is greater than 1, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers where the value at index `i` is 1 and the rest are zeros, the current value of `i` is less than n-1, the current value of `forward` is equal to the value of the city at index `i+1`, if the current value of `i` is greater than 0, the current value of `back` is equal to the value of the city at index `i-1`, otherwise the current value of `back` is -99999999999999999999, and the absolute difference between the current value of `forward` and the value of the city at index `i` is less than the absolute difference between the value of the city at index `i` and the current value of `back`.**

In this output state, the only change is that the value at index `i` in the `prog_cities` list is now 1, indicating that the city at index `i` has been processed. The rest of the variables and their relationships remain the same as in the initial state.
