Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities. The program first calculates the minimum absolute difference between each city and its adjacent cities using the `func_1` function. It then calculates the prefix sum of these differences in both forward and backward directions. Finally, it uses these prefix sums to calculate the minimum number of coins required to travel between any two cities.

The program correctly handles the case where the closest city to a given city is unique, as stated in the problem description. It also correctly calculates the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities, taking into account the option to travel to the closest city for a cost of 1 coin.

The execution summary provided confirms that the `func_1` function correctly calculates the minimum absolute difference between each city and its adjacent cities.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and execution summary, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
