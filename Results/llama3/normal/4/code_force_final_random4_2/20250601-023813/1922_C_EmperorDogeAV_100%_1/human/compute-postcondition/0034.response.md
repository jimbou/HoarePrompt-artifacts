Functionality: This function takes a list of non-negative integers in ascending order and an integer n as input, and returns a list of n-1 integers. The returned list contains the minimum absolute difference between each city and its adjacent cities. If the difference between a city and its next city is less than the difference between the city and its previous city, the function returns 1 for that city. Otherwise, it returns the absolute difference between the city and its next city. The function handles edge cases where a city is at the start or end of the list, using a large negative number as a placeholder for the previous city when a city is at the start, and a large positive number as a placeholder for the next city when a city is at the end.
