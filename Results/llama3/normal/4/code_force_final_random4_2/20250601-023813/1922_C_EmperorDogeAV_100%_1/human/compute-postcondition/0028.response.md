Postcondition: ***cities is a list of non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(cities) and n is greater than 3. If i is less than n-1, then if i is greater than 0, back is the city at index n-1 and forward is the city at index i+1, otherwise, back is -99999999999999999999 and forward is the city at index i+1. If i is not less than n-1, then the state of back and forward is not changed***
