Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 997 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and the length of the list is at least 2, `start_year` is ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + 1 // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1], `x` is 1, stdin contains num_tests - 1 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `start_year` has been updated based on the previous value of `start_year` and the value of `nums[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `start_year` is now calculated as ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + 1 // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1], which is a more complex expression involving the values of `nums[0]` and `nums[1]`.
