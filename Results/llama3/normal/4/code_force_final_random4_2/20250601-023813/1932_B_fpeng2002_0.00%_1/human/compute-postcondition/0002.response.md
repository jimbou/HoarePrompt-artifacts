Output State: **num_tests is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, start_year is 0, stdin contains num_tests - 1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of num_tests has been decremented by 1, n has been assigned the value of the first integer in the first test case, and nums has been assigned the list of integers in the first test case. The value of start_year remains unchanged at 0. The number of test cases in stdin has also been decremented by 1.
