Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive that must have at least 2 integers, `start_year` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 + 2 inclusive, `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `start_year` has been updated to be between 2 and 10^6 + 2 inclusive. This is because the expression `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` will always result in a value that is at least 2 (since `nums[x]` is at least 1 and `start_year` is at least 1) and at most 10^6 + 2 (since `start_year` is at most 10^6 and `nums[x]` is at most 10^6). The other variables remain unchanged.
