Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the list of sign periodicities, updating the start year for each sign based on the previous sign's occurrence. The calculation `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` ensures that the next sign occurs after the previous one, taking into account the periodicity of each sign.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When the signs have different periodicities
* When the signs have the same periodicity
* When the number of signs is 1
* When the number of signs is greater than 1

The program also handles edge cases, such as when the input values are at their minimum or maximum allowed values.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all potential cases correctly.
