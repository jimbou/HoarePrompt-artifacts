Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, based on the periodicities of the signs.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases (`num_tests`) from the input.
2. It then enters a loop that runs for each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities of the signs (`nums`) from the input.
4. It initializes a variable `start_year` to 0, which will keep track of the year in which the current sign is expected to occur.
5. The program then iterates over the periodicities of the signs. For each sign, it calculates the year in which the sign is expected to occur by using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
6. This formula works as follows:
	* `start_year + 1` is the year after the previous sign occurred.
	* `// nums[x]` calculates the number of times the current sign's periodicity fits into the year after the previous sign occurred.
	* `+ 1` increments this count by 1, effectively rounding up to the next occurrence of the current sign.
	* `* nums[x]` multiplies the result by the periodicity of the current sign, giving the year in which the sign is expected to occur.
7. The program updates the `start_year` variable with the calculated year for the current sign.
8. After iterating over all signs, the program prints the final value of `start_year`, which represents the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
