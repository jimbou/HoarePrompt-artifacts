Output State: **num_tests is an integer between 0 and 997 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, start_year is ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0], x is 0, stdin contains num_tests - 1 test cases**

In this output state, the value of start_year has been updated based on the initial value of start_year (0) and the first element of the list nums (nums[0]). The expression ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] calculates the new value of start_year. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains num_tests - 1 test cases, as one test case has been processed.
