The only variable in the loop head is variable x and nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x and the length of the list nums. If x is less than the length of the list nums, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is 1, the length of the list nums is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, x must be increased by 1, so x is 2 and for the loop to execute again the length of the list nums must be at least 3.
State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 997 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and the length of the list is at least 3, `start_year` is ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + 1 // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1], `x` is 2, stdin contains num_tests - 1 test cases**
