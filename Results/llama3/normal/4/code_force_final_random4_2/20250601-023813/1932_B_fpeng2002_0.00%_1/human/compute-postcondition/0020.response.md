Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `start_year` is the sum of ((`start_year` + 1) // `nums[i]` + 1) * `nums[i]` for all `i` in range `n`, `x` is `n - 1`, stdin contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations, with the value of `start_year` being updated at each iteration based on the corresponding value in the `nums` list. The value of `x` has reached `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
