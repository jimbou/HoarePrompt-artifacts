According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x` and `nums`. If `x` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1 and `nums` has at least 2 integers. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be increased by 1 and `nums` must have at least 3 integers.
State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of at least 3 integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `start_year` is ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + ((1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + ((2) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2], `x` is 2, stdin contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases**
