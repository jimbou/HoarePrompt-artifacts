Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities of the signs `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
3. It initializes the `start_year` to 0, which represents the year when the first sign occurs.
4. The program then iterates over each sign, updating the `start_year` to be the next occurrence of the current sign after the previous sign has occurred. This is done using the formula `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
5. After iterating over all signs, the program prints the final `start_year`, which represents the year when the last sign occurs and the apocalypse happens.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, and the formula used to update the `start_year` is correct. The program also handles the edge cases correctly, such as when the number of signs is 1.

Correctness: **True**
