To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `x` and the list `nums`. 

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x` and the length of `nums`. If `x` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 0, and `nums` is a list of at least 1 integer.

For the loop to execute again, `x` must be increased by 1, so `x` is 1. The length of `nums` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of at least 2 integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `start_year` is ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0], `x` is 1, stdin contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases**
