According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nums`. If `nums` has at least 1 integer, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `start_year` is 0, and `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases. For the loop to be executed, `nums` must have at least 1 integer and `x` is 0.

State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive that must have at least 1 integer, `start_year` is 0, `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is 0**
