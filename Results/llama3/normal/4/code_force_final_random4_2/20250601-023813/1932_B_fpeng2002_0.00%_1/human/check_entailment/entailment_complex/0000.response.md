Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities of the signs `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
3. It initializes the `start_year` to 0 and then iterates over the signs.
4. For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence of the sign by adding 1 to the current `start_year`, dividing by the periodicity of the sign, rounding up to the nearest integer, and then multiplying by the periodicity of the sign. This effectively calculates the next occurrence of the sign after the current `start_year`.
5. After iterating over all signs, it prints the final `start_year`, which represents the year when all `n` signs will occur.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, and the execution states provided as comments confirm that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
