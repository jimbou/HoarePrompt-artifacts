The only objects in the loop head are variables  x and nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x and the length of the list nums.  If x is less than the length of the list nums the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, x is 0, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive. So for the loop to be executed one more time x is 1 and the length of the list nums is at least 2.
State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 997 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and the length of the list is at least 2, `start_year` is ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0], `x` is 1, stdin contains num_tests - 1 test cases**
