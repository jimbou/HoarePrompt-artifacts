Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive that must have at least 3 integers, `start_year` is an integer between 3 and 10^6 + 2 inclusive, `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is 2**

The value of `start_year` is updated based on the value of `nums[x]`, where `x` is 2. The new value of `start_year` is calculated as `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. Since `start_year` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 + 2 inclusive, and `nums[x]` is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, the new value of `start_year` will be an integer between 3 and 10^6 + 2 inclusive. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
