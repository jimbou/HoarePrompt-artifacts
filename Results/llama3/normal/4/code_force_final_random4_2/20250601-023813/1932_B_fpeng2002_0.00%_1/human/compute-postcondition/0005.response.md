To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for x in range(0, len(nums)):`. The objects involved are `x` and `nums`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 0, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive that must have at least 1 integer.

For the loop to execute again, `x` needs to be incremented by 1, and `nums` needs to have at least one more integer.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `x` is 1
* `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive that must have at least 2 integers

The other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, `start_year`, and `stdin`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive that must have at least 2 integers, `start_year` is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is 1**
