The variable in the loop head is num_tests, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable num_tests.  If num_tests is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, num_tests is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, So for the loop to be executed one more time num_tests must be greater than 0.
State: **num_tests is an integer between 1 and 999 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, start_year is an integer between n and 10^6 * n inclusive, stdin contains num_tests - 1 test cases, x is n - 1, and start_year which is an integer between n and 10^6 * n inclusive is being printed**
