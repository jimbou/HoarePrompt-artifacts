To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `num_tests > 0`. Since `num_tests` is already defined as an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, it inherently satisfies the condition for the loop to execute at least once.

Given that `num_tests` is within the range of 1 to 1000, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustments to the state of `num_tests` or any other variables are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains `num_tests` test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).**
