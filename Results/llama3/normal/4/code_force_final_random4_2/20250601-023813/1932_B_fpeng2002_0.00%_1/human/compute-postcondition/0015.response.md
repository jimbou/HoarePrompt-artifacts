Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of at least 1 integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `start_year` is ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0], `x` is 0, stdin contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `start_year` has been updated based on the initial value of `start_year` (which is 0) and the value of `nums[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases.
