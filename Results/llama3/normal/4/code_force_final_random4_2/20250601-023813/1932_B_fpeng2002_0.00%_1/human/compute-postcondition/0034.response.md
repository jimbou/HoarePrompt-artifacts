Output State: **num_tests is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, start_year is (((((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + 1 // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2], x is n - 1, stdin contains no test cases, and the start_year is printed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the number of test cases is 0, the number of integers in the list is between 1 and 100 inclusive, the list of integers is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, the start year is calculated based on the list of integers, the loop counter is at the last index of the list, there are no more test cases in the standard input, and the start year is printed.
