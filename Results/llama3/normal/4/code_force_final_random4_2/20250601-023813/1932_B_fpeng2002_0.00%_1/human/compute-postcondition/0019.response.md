Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of at least 3 integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `start_year` is ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + ((1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + ((2) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2] + ((3) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2], `x` is 2, stdin contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `start_year` has been updated by adding the result of the expression `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` to its previous value. The value of `x` is still 2, and the values of `num_tests`, `n`, and `nums` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases.
