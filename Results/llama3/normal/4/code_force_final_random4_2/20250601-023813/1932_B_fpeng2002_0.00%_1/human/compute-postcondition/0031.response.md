Output State: **num_tests is an integer between 0 and 997 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, start_year is (((((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + 1 // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2], x is n - 1, stdin contains num_tests - 1 test cases**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the value of `start_year`, which has been updated according to the loop body. The value of `x` has also been updated to `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The state of the other variables, including `num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, and `stdin`, remains unchanged.
