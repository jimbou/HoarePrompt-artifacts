The variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`.  If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive. For the loop to be executed one more time, `num_tests` must be greater than 0.
State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 1 and 998 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `start_year` is the sum of ((`start_year` + 1) // `nums[i]` + 1) * `nums[i]` for all `i` in range `n`, `x` is `n - 1`, stdin contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, and the start_year is printed**
