According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x` and `nums`. If `x` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1, `nums` has at least 2 integers. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be increased by 1 and `nums` must have at least 3 integers.

State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive that must have at least 3 integers, `start_year` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 + 2 inclusive, `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is 2**
