Output State: **num_tests is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, start_year is an integer between n and 10^6 * n inclusive, stdin contains num_tests - 1 test cases, x is n - 1**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations, and the variables have reached their final values. The value of `start_year` has been updated to be between `n` and `10^6 * n` inclusive, reflecting the cumulative effect of the loop iterations. The value of `x` has reached `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The other variables, `num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, and `stdin`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
