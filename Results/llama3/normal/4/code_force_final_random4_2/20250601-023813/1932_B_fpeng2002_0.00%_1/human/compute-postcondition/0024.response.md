Output State: **num_tests is an integer between 0 and 997 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, start_year is 0, x is n - 1, stdin contains num_tests test cases.**

Here's a breakdown of the changes:

*   `num_tests` is decremented by 1, so it's now between 0 and 997 inclusive.
*   `n` is assigned a new value from the input, so it's now an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
*   `nums` is reassigned a new list of integers from the input, so it's now a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive.
*   `start_year` is reset to 0.
*   `x` is not modified in this code snippet, but since `n` has changed, `x` is now `n - 1`.
*   `stdin` now contains `num_tests` test cases, since one test case has been processed.
