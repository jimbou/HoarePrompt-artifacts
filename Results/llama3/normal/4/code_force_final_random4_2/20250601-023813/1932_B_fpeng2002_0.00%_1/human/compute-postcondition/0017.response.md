Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of at least 2 integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `start_year` is ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + ((1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1], `x` is 1, stdin contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `num_tests` remains the same, between 0 and 998 inclusive. The value of `n` remains the same, between 1 and 100 inclusive. The value of `nums` remains the same, a list of at least 2 integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive. The value of `start_year` is updated to be the sum of the original `start_year` and the result of the expression `((1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`. The value of `x` remains the same, 1. The stdin still contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases.
