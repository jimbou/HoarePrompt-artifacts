Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, based on the provided periodicities of the signs.

The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the number of signs for each test case. It then calculates the start year for each test case by iterating through the list of periodicities.

The calculation of the start year is done using the formula `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, which is correct based on the problem description. This formula ensures that the start year is incremented by the smallest multiple of the current periodicity that is greater than the current start year.

The program then prints the calculated start year for each test case.

Based on the execution summary, the program behaves as expected, reading the input, calculating the start year, and printing the result for each test case.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
