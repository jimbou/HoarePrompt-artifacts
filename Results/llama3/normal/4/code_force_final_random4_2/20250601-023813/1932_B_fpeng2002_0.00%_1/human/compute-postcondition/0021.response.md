The code prints the value of `start_year`, which is calculated as the sum of ((`start_year` + 1) // `nums[i]` + 1) * `nums[i]` for all `i` in range `n`. However, since `start_year` is not explicitly defined, we cannot compute its exact numerical value.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is the sum of ((start_year + 1) // nums[i] + 1) * nums[i] for all i in range n)**
