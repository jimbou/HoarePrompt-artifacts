To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `nums`. The loop will execute if `nums` has at least one element. Since `x` is the loop variable, it should start at 0. 

State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of at least 1 integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `start_year` is 0, `x` is 0, stdin contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, and the value of `start_year` which is an integer between `n` and 10^6 * `n` inclusive is being printed**
