Output State: **num_tests is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, start_year is 0, x is n - 1, stdin contains num_tests - 1 test cases, and the value of start_year which is an integer between n and 10^6 * n inclusive is being printed.**

The code block modifies the initial state in the following ways:

1. The first line decrements `num_tests` by 1, resulting in a value between 0 and 998 inclusive.

2. The second line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, making it an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.

3. The third line assigns a list of integers from the input to `nums`, making it a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive.

4. The fourth line assigns 0 to `start_year`, overriding its previous value.

The value of `x` remains unchanged as `n - 1`, and the value of `start_year` which is an integer between `n` and 10^6 * `n` inclusive is being printed. Stdin now contains `num_tests - 1` test cases.
