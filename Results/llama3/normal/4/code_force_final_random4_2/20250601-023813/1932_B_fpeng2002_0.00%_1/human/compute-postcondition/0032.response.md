The code prints the value of `start_year` which is calculated based on the values of `nums[0]`, `nums[1]`, and `nums[2]`. Since the exact values of `nums[0]`, `nums[1]`, and `nums[2]` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `start_year`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated `start_year`.
Output: **start_year (where start_year is the calculated value based on the values of nums[0], nums[1], and nums[2])**
