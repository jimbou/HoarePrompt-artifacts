The code prints the value of `s1` if `cnt` is not zero, otherwise it prints 0. Since `s1` is equal to the count of '1' in string `s` and `t1` is equal to the count of '1' in string `t`, and the current value of `s1` is equal to the current value of `t1`, the print statement will output the count of '1' in string `s` if `cnt` is not zero, otherwise it will output 0.
Output: **s1 (which is the count of '1' in string s) if cnt is not zero, otherwise 0**
