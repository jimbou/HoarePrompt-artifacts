Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5). The second and third lines contain strings s and f of n characters, respectively, where each character is either '1' or '0'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    t = input()
    s1 = s.count('1')
    t1 = t.count('1')
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        cnt += s[i] != t[i]
    if s1 == t1:
        print(s1 if cnt else 0)
    else:
        d = abs(s1 - t1)
        print((cnt - d) // 2 + d)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `s`, `t1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `t`, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is `n-1`. If the count of '1' in `s` is equal to the count of '1' in `t`, then the value of `s1` is printed if `cnt` is not zero, otherwise 0 is printed. If the count of '1' in `s` is not equal to the count of '1' in `t`, then the absolute difference between the count of '1' in `s` and the count of '1' in `t` is calculated and `(cnt - d) // 2 + d` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `s`, `t1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `t`, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `_` is 1, `i` is `n-1`. If the current value of `s1` is equal to the current value of `t1`, then the value of `s1` is printed if `cnt` is not zero, otherwise 0 is printed. If `s1` is not equal to `t1`, then the result of the expression `(cnt - d) // 2 + d` is printed, where `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `s`, `t1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `t`, `cnt` is the sum of the boolean values of `s[i]` not being equal to `t[i]` for all `i` in range `n`, `_` is 2, `i` is `n-1`. If the count of '1's in `s` is equal to the count of '1's in `t`, then the count of '1's in `s` is printed if `cnt` is true, otherwise 0 is printed. If the count of '1's in `s` is not equal to the count of '1's in `t`, then the value of `(cnt - d) // 2 + d` is printed, where `d` is the absolute difference between the count of '1' in `s` and the count of '1' in `t`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
