According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer greater than 1, s is a string, t is a string, s1 is an integer equal to the count of '1' in s, t1 is an integer equal to the count of '1' in t, cnt is 0, _ is 2, i is n-1 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 0.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `s`, `t1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `t`, `cnt` is 0, `_` is 2, `i` is 0**
