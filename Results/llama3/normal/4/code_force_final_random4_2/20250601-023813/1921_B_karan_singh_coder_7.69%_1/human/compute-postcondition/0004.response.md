To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables (`s`, `t`, `s1`, `t1`, `cnt`, and `_`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `s`, `t1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `t`, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 0, `i` is 1**
