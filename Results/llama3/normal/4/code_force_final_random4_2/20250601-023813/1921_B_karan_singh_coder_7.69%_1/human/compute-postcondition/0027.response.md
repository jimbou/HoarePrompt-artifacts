The code prints the value of `s1` if `cnt` is not zero, otherwise it prints 0. Since `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n` (inclusive), and `s1` is equal to `t1` which is the count of '1' in string `t`, the print statement will output either the count of '1' in string `t` or 0.
Output: **the count of '1' in string t if cnt is not zero, otherwise 0**
