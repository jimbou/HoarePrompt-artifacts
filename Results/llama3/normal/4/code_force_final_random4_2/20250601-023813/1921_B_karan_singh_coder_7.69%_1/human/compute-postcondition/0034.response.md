The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and the range of the loop, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and the range of the loop. If `_` is less than the range of the loop, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, the range of the loop is `n` which is an integer greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again the range of the loop must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `s`, `t1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `t`, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `_` is 2, `i` is `n-1`.**
