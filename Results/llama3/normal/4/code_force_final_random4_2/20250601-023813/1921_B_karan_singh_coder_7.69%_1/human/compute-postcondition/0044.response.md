To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the given information and the code snippet.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0.
   - `s` and `t` are strings.
   - `s1` is the count of '1' in string `s`.
   - `t1` is the count of '1' in string `t`.
   - `cnt` is the sum of boolean values indicating whether `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]` for all `i` in range `n`.
   - `_` is 2 (though this variable does not affect the print statement directly).
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - The current value of `s1` is equal to the current value of `t1`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```
   print(s1 if cnt else 0)
   ```

Given the condition in the print statement, there are two possible outcomes based on the value of `cnt`:

- **If `cnt` is True (or any non-zero value)**: This means there is at least one position `i` where `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`. In this case, the statement will print the value of `s1`, which is the count of '1' in string `s`.

- **If `cnt` is False (or zero)**: This means for all positions `i`, `s[i]` is equal to `t[i]`. In this case, the statement will print `0`.

Since the exact values of `s`, `t`, and consequently `cnt` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical output. However, based on the condition, the output will either be the count of '1' in string `s` (if `cnt` is True) or `0` (if `cnt` is False).

**Output: ** **s1 (the count of '1' in string s) if cnt is True, otherwise 0**
