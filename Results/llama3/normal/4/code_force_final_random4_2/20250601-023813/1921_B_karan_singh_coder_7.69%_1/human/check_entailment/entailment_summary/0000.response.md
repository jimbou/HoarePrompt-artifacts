Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct. It accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes into the desired state. It handles both cases when the number of '1's in the initial and desired states are equal and when they are not. The program's logic is sound, and it produces the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
