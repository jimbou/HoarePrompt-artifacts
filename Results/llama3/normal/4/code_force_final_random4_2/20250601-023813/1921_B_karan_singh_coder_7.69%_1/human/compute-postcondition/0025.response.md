Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `s`, `t1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `t`, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `_` is 1, `i` is `n-1`.**

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `n`, `s`, `t`, `s1`, `t1`, and `_` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `cnt` has been updated to reflect the total number of mismatches between the strings `s` and `t` up to the length of `n`, and the variable `i` has reached its final value of `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
