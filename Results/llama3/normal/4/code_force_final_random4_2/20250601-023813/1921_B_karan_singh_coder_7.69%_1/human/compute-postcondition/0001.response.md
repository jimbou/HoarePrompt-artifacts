The code block consists of six lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since stdin contains an integer `t` that must be greater than 0, `n` becomes equal to `t`. The second line assigns the string value of the input to `s`. The third line assigns the string value of the input to `t`. The fourth line assigns the count of '1' in string `s` to `s1`. The fifth line assigns the count of '1' in string `t` to `t1`. The sixth line assigns 0 to `cnt`.

Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, s is a string, t is a string, s1 is an integer equal to the count of '1' in s, t1 is an integer equal to the count of '1' in t, cnt is 0, _ is 0, stdin is empty**
