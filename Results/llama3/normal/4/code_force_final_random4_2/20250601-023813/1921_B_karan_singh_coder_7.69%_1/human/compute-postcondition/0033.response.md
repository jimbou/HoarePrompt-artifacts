Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `s`, `t1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `t`, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `_` is 1, `i` is `n-1`. If the current value of `s1` is equal to the current value of `t1`, then the value of `s1` is printed if `cnt` is not zero, otherwise 0 is printed. If `s1` is not equal to `t1`, then the result of the expression `(cnt - d) // 2 + d` is printed, where `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.***
