This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the minimum number of operations required to make two binary strings equal. It takes no arguments and returns no value, but instead prints the result for each test case. The function reads an integer t, followed by t test cases, each consisting of an integer n and two binary strings s and t of length n. It then calculates the minimum number of operations required to make s and t equal, considering two cases: when the number of '1's in s and t are equal, and when they are not. In the first case, it prints the count of '1's in s if the strings are not identical, otherwise 0. In the second case, it prints the minimum number of operations required to make the strings equal, taking into account the difference in the count of '1's between the two strings.
