The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5) — the number of boxes. The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters, where the i-th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise. The third line of each test case contains a string f of n characters, where the i-th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise.
