Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `s`, `t1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `t`, `cnt` is either 0, 1 or 2, `_` is 0, `i` is 1**

The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1 if the characters at index `i` in strings `s` and `t` are different, otherwise it remains the same. Since `i` is 1, the comparison is between the second characters of `s` and `t`. The value of `cnt` can be 0, 1 or 2 depending on whether the characters at index `i` in `s` and `t` are the same or different. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
