The code `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` increments the value of `cnt` by 1 if the characters at index `i` in strings `s` and `t` are different, and leaves `cnt` unchanged if they are the same.

In the initial state, `i` is 0, so we are comparing the first characters of `s` and `t`. The value of `cnt` is initially 0.

If the first characters of `s` and `t` are different, `cnt` becomes 1. If they are the same, `cnt` remains 0.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `s`, `t1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `t`, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 1, `i` is 0**
