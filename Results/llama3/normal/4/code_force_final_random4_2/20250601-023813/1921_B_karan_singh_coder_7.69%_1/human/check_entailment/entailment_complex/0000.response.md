Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to make two binary strings equal. The program considers two cases: when the number of '1's in the initial and final strings are equal, and when they are not. In the first case, it prints the count of '1's in the initial string if the strings are not identical, otherwise 0. In the second case, it prints the minimum number of operations required to make the strings equal, taking into account the difference in the count of '1's between the two strings.

Correctness: **True**
