#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5). The second and third lines contain strings s and f of n characters, respectively, where each character is either '1' or '0'.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        t = input()
        
        s1 = s.count('1')
        
        t1 = t.count('1')
        
        cnt = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            cnt += s[i] != t[i]
        
        if s1 == t1:
            print(s1 if cnt else 0)
        else:
            d = abs(s1 - t1)
            print((cnt - d) // 2 + d)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `s`, `t1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `t`, `cnt` is the sum of the boolean values of `s[i]` not being equal to `t[i]` for all `i` in range `n`, `_` is equal to the integer `t` from the initial state, `i` is `n-1`. If the count of '1's in `s` is equal to the count of '1's in `t`, then the count of '1's in `s` is printed if `cnt` is true, otherwise 0 is printed. If the count of '1's in `s` is not equal to the count of '1's in `t`, then the value of `(cnt - d) // 2 + d` is printed, where `d` is the absolute difference between the count of '1' in `s` and the count of '1' in `t`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the minimum number of operations required to make two binary strings equal. It takes no arguments and returns no value, but instead prints the result for each test case. The function reads an integer t, followed by t test cases, each consisting of an integer n and two binary strings s and t of length n. It then calculates the minimum number of operations required to make s and t equal, considering two cases: when the number of '1's in s and t are equal, and when they are not. In the first case, it prints the count of '1's in s if the strings are not identical, otherwise 0. In the second case, it prints the minimum number of operations required to make the strings equal, taking into account the difference in the count of '1's between the two strings.
