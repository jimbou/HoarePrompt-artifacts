Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `s`, `t1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `t`, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 0, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` is either 0 or 1 because it is incremented by the result of the comparison `s[i] != t[i]`, which is either `True` (1) or `False` (0). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
