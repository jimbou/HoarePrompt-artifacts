The code `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` increments the value of `cnt` by 1 if the characters at index `i` in strings `s` and `t` are different, otherwise it remains the same.

Since `i` is 1, we are comparing the second characters of `s` and `t`. The value of `cnt` is either 0 or 1.

If the second characters of `s` and `t` are the same, `cnt` remains the same, i.e., either 0 or 1.

If the second characters of `s` and `t` are different, `cnt` is incremented by 1, so it becomes either 1 or 2.

The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `s`, `t1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `t`, `cnt` is either 0, 1 or 2, `_` is 1, `i` is 1**
