Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `s`, `t1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `t`, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of `n` remains unchanged, `s` and `t` are still strings, `s1` and `t1` still represent the count of '1' in `s` and `t` respectively, `cnt` has been incremented by the number of times `s[i]` was not equal to `t[i]` during the loop iterations, and `i` has reached the value of `n-1`. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0.
