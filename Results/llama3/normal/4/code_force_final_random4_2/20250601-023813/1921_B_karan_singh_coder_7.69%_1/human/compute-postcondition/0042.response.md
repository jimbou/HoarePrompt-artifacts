Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `s`, `t1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `t`, `cnt` is the sum of the boolean values of `s[i]` not being equal to `t[i]` for all `i` in range `n`, `_` is 2, `i` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` can be any integer (including 0), `s` and `t` remain strings, `s1` and `t1` still represent the count of '1' in `s` and `t` respectively, `cnt` now holds the total count of positions where `s` and `t` differ, the value of `_` remains unchanged at 2, and `i` has reached the last index of the range defined by `n`.
