Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `s`, `t1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `t`, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `d` is an integer greater than 0 equal to the absolute difference between the count of '1' in `s` and the count of '1' in `t`.**

In this output state, the value of `d` is calculated as the absolute difference between the count of '1' in `s` and the count of '1' in `t`, which is greater than 0 since the count of '1' in `s` is not equal to the count of '1' in `t`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
