Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `s`, `t1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `t`, `cnt` is the sum of the boolean values of `s[i]` not being equal to `t[i]` for all `i` in range `n`, `_` is 2, `i` is `n-1`, `d` is the absolute difference between the count of '1' in `s` and the count of '1' in `t`.**

In this output state, the value of `d` is the absolute difference between the count of '1' in `s` and the count of '1' in `t`, which is calculated using the `abs` function. The other variables remain unchanged.
