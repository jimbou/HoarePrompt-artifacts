Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `s`, `t1` is an integer equal to the count of '1' in `t`, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `_` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `s1` is not equal to `t1`, and `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `s`, `t`, `s1`, `t1`, `cnt`, `_`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. A new variable `d` is introduced, which is assigned the absolute difference between the count of '1' in strings `s` and `t`, represented by `s1` and `t1` respectively.
