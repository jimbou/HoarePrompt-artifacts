Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `x` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `cx` is a set containing the integer `x` if `a` is 1 otherwise it is a set containing the integer `x` if `x` is not already in `cx`, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is 1 otherwise it is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1 otherwise it is the maximum of `x` and the maximum of `x` and -1, stdin contains `t-6` test cases if `a` is 1 otherwise `t-5` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer greater than 0. The list `r` is still empty. The value of `n` remains an integer greater than 2. The value of `_` remains 2. The value of `a` remains the first integer from the input. The value of `x` remains the second integer from the input. The set `cx` now contains the integer `x` if `a` is 1, or if `a` is not 1, `cx` now contains the integer `x` if `x` is not already in `cx`. The value of `ax` remains 1000000007 if `a` is 1, otherwise it remains the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. The value of `bx` remains the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise it remains the maximum of `x` and the maximum of `x` and -1. The number of test cases in stdin remains `t-6` if `a` is 1, otherwise it remains `t-5`.
