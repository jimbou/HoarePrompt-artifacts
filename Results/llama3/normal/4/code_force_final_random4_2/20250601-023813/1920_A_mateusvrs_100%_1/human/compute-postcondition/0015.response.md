Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 otherwise it is a set containing the integer `x` if `a` is 2, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is 1 otherwise it is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1 otherwise it is -1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, and `x` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `r`, `_`, and `n` remain unchanged. The value of `stdin` is updated to contain `t-4` test cases, as one test case has been consumed by the `input()` function. The values of `cx`, `ax`, and `bx` are updated based on the new values of `a` and `x`. The values of `a` and `x` are updated to the first and second integers from the input, respectively.
