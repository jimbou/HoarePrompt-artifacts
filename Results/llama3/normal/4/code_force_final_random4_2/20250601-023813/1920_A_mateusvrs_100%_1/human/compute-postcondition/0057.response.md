Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is a list containing one element, `stdin` contains a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input and is not equal to 1. If `a` is equal to 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set, and `x` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input. If `a` is not equal to 2, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is a set containing one element which is the second integer from the input.***
