Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is a list containing three elements, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and the minimum of all `x` values when `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of -1 and the maximum of all `x` values when `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing all `x` values when `a` is not 1 and not 2, `i` is the last element in the set `cx`, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, and the last element in `r` is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, except for `r`, which now contains three elements. The last element in `r` is calculated as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `ax` and `bx` are the minimum and maximum values of `x` when `a` is 2 and 1, respectively, and `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that fall within the range of `bx` to `ax`.
