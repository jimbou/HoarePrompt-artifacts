Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is a set containing one or more elements which are `x`, stdin is empty, and the current value of `bx` is greater than the current value of `ax`.**

In this output state, the list `r` now contains two elements, with the second element being 0, which was appended by the code. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
