Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases if `a` is 1 otherwise `t-4` test cases, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 otherwise it is a set containing the integer `x`, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is 1 otherwise it is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1 otherwise it is the maximum of `x` and the maximum of `x` and -1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, and `x` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input.***
