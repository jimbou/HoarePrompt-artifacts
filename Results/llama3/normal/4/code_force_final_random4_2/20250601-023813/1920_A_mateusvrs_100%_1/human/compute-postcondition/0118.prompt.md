Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than n+1, r is a list containing two elements, _ is n+1, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is an integer, x is an integer, ax is 1000000007, bx is -1, cx is an empty set, stdin is empty, i is not defined, tmp is not defined
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    a, x = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 1:
        bx = max(x, bx)
    elif a == 2:
        ax = min(x, ax)
    else:
        cx.add(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer greater than `n`+1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `x` is an integer, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1. If `a` is 1, `ax` is 1000000007. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 1 and not 2, `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. `i` is not defined, `tmp` is not defined, `stdin` contains a space-separated list of integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than `n`+1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer. If `a` is 1, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 1 and not 2, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. `i` is not defined, `tmp` is not defined, stdin is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than `n`+1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `i` is not defined, `tmp` is not defined, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers. If `a` is 1, `ax` is 1000000007 and `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 1 and not 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
