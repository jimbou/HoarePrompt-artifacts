To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is a list containing one element, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, and `x` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input**
