Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`, stdin is empty. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x`, 1000000007 and the previous value of `ax`, `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `cx` is a set containing two elements which are `x`.***
