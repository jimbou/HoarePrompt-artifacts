To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for i in cx:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `cx`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `cx` has at least one more element. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the first element in the set `cx`. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be the next element in the set `cx`, and `cx` should have at least one more element.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `tmp` is 1 if the second element in the set `cx` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `tmp` is 0, stdin is empty, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `cx` is a set containing all integers `x` where `a` is not 1 or 2 and must have at least 2 elements, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` where `a` is 2 and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` where `a` is 1 and -1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `x` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, and `i` is the second element in the set `cx`.**
