Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is a set containing at least two elements which are `x` and another element, `i` is the second element in the set `cx`, `tmp` is either 1 or 2. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), then `tmp` is 2; otherwise, `tmp` is 1.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial properties, except for `tmp`. The value of `tmp` is incremented by 1, so it can be either 1 or 2. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), then `tmp` is 2; otherwise, `tmp` is 1.
