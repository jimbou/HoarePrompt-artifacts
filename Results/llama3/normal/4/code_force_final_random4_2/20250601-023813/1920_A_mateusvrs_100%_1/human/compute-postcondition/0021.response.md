To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `n` is an integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `_` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases if `a` is 1 otherwise `t-4` test cases, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 otherwise it is a set containing the integer `x`, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is 1 otherwise it is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1 otherwise it is the maximum of `x` and the maximum of `x` and -1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, and `x` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input.**
