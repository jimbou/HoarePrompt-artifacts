The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is `n`, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is `n+1` and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than `n+1`.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is `n+1`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is a set containing one or more elements which are `x`, stdin is empty. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, then the current value of `bx` is greater than the current value of `ax`. Otherwise, `i` is the last element in the set `cx`, and `tmp` is either equal to the number of elements in `cx` or the number of elements in `cx` that are within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive).**
