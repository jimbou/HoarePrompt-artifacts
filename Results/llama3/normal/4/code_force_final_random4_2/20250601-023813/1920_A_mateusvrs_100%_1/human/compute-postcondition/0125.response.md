Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and the minimum of all `x` values when `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of -1 and the maximum of all `x` values when `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing all `x` values when `a` is not 1 and not 2 that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the set `cx`, `tmp` is 1, and `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`. The current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `tmp` being 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships.
