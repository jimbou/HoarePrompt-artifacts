Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. It iterates over each constraint and updates the maximum x value when a is 1, the minimum x value when a is 2, and the set of x values when a is not 1 or 2.
3. It checks if the maximum x value when a is 1 is greater than the minimum x value when a is 2. If this condition is true, it means that there are no integers k that satisfy all constraints, so it appends 0 to the result list.
4. If the condition is false, it calculates the number of x values in the set that are within the range of the minimum and maximum x values. This is done by iterating over the set of x values and checking if each value is within the range.
5. It then calculates the total number of integers k that satisfy all constraints by subtracting the count of x values within the range from the difference between the maximum and minimum x values plus 1.
6. Finally, it appends the result to the result list and prints the list.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
