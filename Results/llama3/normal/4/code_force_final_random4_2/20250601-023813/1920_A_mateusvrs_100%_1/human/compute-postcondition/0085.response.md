The only object in the loop head is variable  i and set cx, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set cx.  If the set has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, cx has at least 2 elements, i is the second element in the set cx. So for the loop to be executed one more time the set must have at least 3 elements and the i is the third element in the set cx.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is a set containing at least three elements which are `x`, the second element in the set `cx` and another element, `i` is the third element in the set `cx`, stdin is empty. The maximum of `x` and -1 is less than or equal to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), then `tmp` is 2; otherwise, `tmp` is 1.**
