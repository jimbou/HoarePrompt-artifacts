The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and set cx, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set cx. If the set cx has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, cx has at least 2 elements, i is the second element in the set cx. So for the loop to be executed one more time the set cx must have at least 3 elements and the i is the third element in the set cx.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `tmp` is 2 if the third element in the set `cx` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `tmp` is 1, stdin is empty, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `cx` is a set containing all integers `x` where `a` is not 1 or 2 and must have at least 3 elements, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` where `a` is 2 and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` where `a` is 1 and -1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `x` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, and `i` is the third element in the set `cx`.**
