The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and set `cx`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `cx`. If the set `cx` has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `cx` has at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the set `cx`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the set `cx` must have at least 2 elements and the `i` is the second element in the set `cx`.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and the minimum of all `x` values when `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of -1 and the maximum of all `x` values when `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing all `x` values when `a` is not 1 and not 2 that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the set `cx`, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
