Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`, stdin is empty.**

The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `x`, respectively. Since the initial state specifies that `a` is the first integer from the input and `x` is the second integer from the input, the values of `a` and `x` are updated to the new input values.

The values of `t`, `r`, `_`, and `n` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code.

The value of `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and -1, as specified in the initial state.

The value of `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, as specified in the initial state.

The value of `cx` is updated to a set containing one element, which is `x`, as specified in the initial state.

The stdin is now empty, as the input has been read and processed.

Note that the initial state specifies conditional updates for `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` based on the value of `a`, but since `a` is now an integer, these conditions are no longer applicable.
