The only variables in the loop head are variables  `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`, stdin is empty. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x`, 1000000007 and the previous value of `ax`, `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `cx` is a set containing two elements which are `x`.**
