The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, `t` becomes the number of test cases. The second line initializes an empty list `r`.

Output State: **t is the number of test cases, r is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases.**
