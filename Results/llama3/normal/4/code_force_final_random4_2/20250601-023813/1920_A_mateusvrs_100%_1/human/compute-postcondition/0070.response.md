Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `cx` is a set containing two elements which are `x` and `x`, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `r`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `x`, `bx`, and `ax` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The only change is in the set `cx`, which initially contained one element `x` but now contains two elements, both of which are `x`, because the code added `x` to the set again. The stdin remains empty as it was initially.
