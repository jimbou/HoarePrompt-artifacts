Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, r is an empty list, stdin is empty, _ is n, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, cx is a set containing all integers x where a is not 1 or 2, ax is the minimum of all x where a is 2 and 1000000007, bx is the maximum of all x where a is 1 and -1, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, and x is an integer equal to the second integer from the input.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* `t` remains a positive integer greater than 0.
* `r` remains an empty list.
* `stdin` is empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
* `_` is equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times.
* `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, indicating the number of iterations.
* `cx` is a set containing all integers `x` where `a` is not 1 or 2.
* `ax` is the minimum of all `x` where `a` is 2 and 1000000007.
* `bx` is the maximum of all `x` where `a` is 1 and -1.
* `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input.
* `x` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input.

Note that the state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
