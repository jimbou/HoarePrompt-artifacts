Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than `n`+1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `x` is an integer, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1. If `a` is 1, `ax` is 1000000007. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 1 and not 2, `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. `i` is not defined, `tmp` is not defined, `stdin` contains a space-separated list of integers.***
