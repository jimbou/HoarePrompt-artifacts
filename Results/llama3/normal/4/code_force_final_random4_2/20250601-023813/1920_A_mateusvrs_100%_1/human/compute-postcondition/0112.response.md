Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `n`+1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `i` is not defined, `tmp` is not defined, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers. If `a` is 1, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 1 and not 2, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `r`, `_`, and `n` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `x` are updated to the input values. The values of `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` are updated based on the value of `a`. The stdin now contains a space-separated list of integers. The values of `i` and `tmp` are still undefined.
