Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, r is a list containing one element which is 0, stdin is empty, _ is n, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, cx is a set containing all integers x where a is not 1 or 2, ax is the minimum of all x where a is 2 and 1000000007, bx is the maximum of all x where a is 1 and -1, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, and x is an integer equal to the second integer from the input. The current value of bx is greater than the current value of ax.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 0. The list r, which was initially empty, now contains one element which is 0. The stdin remains empty. The value of n remains unchanged as an integer greater than or equal to 0. The set cx remains unchanged as a set containing all integers x where a is not 1 or 2. The value of ax remains unchanged as the minimum of all x where a is 2 and 1000000007. The value of bx remains unchanged as the maximum of all x where a is 1 and -1. The value of a remains unchanged as an integer equal to the first integer from the input. The value of x remains unchanged as an integer equal to the second integer from the input. The current value of bx is still greater than the current value of ax.
