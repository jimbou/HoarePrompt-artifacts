Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is a set containing one or more elements which are `x`, `tmp` is 0, stdin is empty. The maximum of `x` and -1 is less than or equal to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `tmp` which is assigned the value 0. All other variables retain their original values and properties.
