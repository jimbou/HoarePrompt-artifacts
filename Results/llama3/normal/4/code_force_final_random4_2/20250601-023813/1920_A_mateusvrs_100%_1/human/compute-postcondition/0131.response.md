Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and the minimum of all `x` values when `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of -1 and the maximum of all `x` values when `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing all `x` values when `a` is not 1 and not 2 that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is `i'` (the next element in the set `cx`), `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is 3. Otherwise, `tmp` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been incremented by 1. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax`, `tmp` is now 3; otherwise, it is 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
