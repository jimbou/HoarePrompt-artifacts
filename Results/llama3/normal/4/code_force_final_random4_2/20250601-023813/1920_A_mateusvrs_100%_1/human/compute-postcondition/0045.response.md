Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, r is a list containing one element, stdin is empty, _ is n, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, cx is a set containing all integers x where a is not 1 or 2, ax is the minimum of all x where a is 2 and 1000000007, bx is the maximum of all x where a is 1 and -1, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, and x is an integer equal to the second integer from the input. If bx is greater than ax, the list r contains 0. Otherwise, the list r contains ax - bx + 1 - tmp, where tmp is the number of elements in cx that are greater than or equal to bx and less than or equal to ax.**
