Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `n`+1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1. If `a` is 1, `ax` is 1000000007. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 1 and not 2, `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. `i` is not defined, `tmp` is not defined, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `r`, `_`, and `n` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `x` are updated to the integers read from the input. The value of `bx` is determined based on the value of `a`. The values of `ax` and `cx` are updated based on the value of `a`. The values of `i` and `tmp` are still undefined. The stdin is now empty since the input has been read.
