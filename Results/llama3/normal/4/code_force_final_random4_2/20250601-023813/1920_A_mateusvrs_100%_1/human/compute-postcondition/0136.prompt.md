Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is the number of test cases, r is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cx = set()
    ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
    bx = -1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, x = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1:
            bx = max(x, bx)
        elif a == 2:
            ax = min(x, ax)
        else:
            cx.add(x)
    if bx > ax:
        r.append(0)
    else:
        tmp = 0
        for i in cx:
            if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                tmp += 1
        r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 0, r is a list containing one element, stdin is empty, _ is n, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, cx is a set containing all integers x where a is not 1 or 2, ax is the minimum of all x where a is 2 and 1000000007, bx is the maximum of all x where a is 1 and -1, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, and x is an integer equal to the second integer from the input. If bx is greater than ax, the list r contains 0. Otherwise, the list r contains ax - bx + 1 - tmp, where tmp is the number of elements in cx that are greater than or equal to bx and less than or equal to ax.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is a set containing one or more elements which are `x`, stdin is empty. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, then the current value of `bx` is greater than the current value of `ax`. Otherwise, `i` is the last element in the set `cx`, and `tmp` is either equal to the number of elements in `cx` or the number of elements in `cx` that are within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 0, r is a list containing three elements, _ is n, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is an integer, x is an integer, ax is the minimum of 1000000007 and the minimum of all x values when a is 2, bx is the maximum of -1 and the maximum of all x values when a is 1, cx is a set containing all x values when a is not 1 and not 2. If bx > ax, then the current value of bx is greater than the current value of ax. Otherwise, i is the last element in the set cx, bx is less than or equal to ax, tmp is the number of elements in cx that are greater than or equal to bx and less than or equal to ax, and the last element in r is ax - bx + 1 - tmp.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
