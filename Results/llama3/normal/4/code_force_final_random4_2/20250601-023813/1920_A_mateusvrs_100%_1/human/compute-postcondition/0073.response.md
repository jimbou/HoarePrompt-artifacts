Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is a set containing one or more elements which are `x`, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 1.
*   The list `r` still contains one element.
*   The variable `_` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times.
*   The value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer greater than or equal to 0.
*   The values of `a` and `x` are the last values read from the input.
*   The value of `ax` is the minimum of all the values of `x` that were read when `a` was 2, and 1000000007.
*   The value of `bx` is the maximum of all the values of `x` that were read when `a` was 1, and -1.
*   The set `cx` contains all the values of `x` that were read when `a` was not 1 or 2.
*   The standard input `stdin` is empty, indicating that all input has been read.
