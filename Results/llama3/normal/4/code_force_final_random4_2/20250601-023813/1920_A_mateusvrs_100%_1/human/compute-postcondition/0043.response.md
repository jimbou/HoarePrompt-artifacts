Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, stdin is empty, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `cx` is a set containing all integers `x` where `a` is not 1 or 2, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` where `a` is 2 and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` where `a` is 1 and -1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `x` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, and `i` is the last element in the set `cx`.**

The output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `tmp` will be the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive). The other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still a positive integer, `r` an empty list, stdin empty, `_` equal to `n`, `n` an integer greater than or equal to 0, `cx` a set of integers where `a` is not 1 or 2, `ax` the minimum of all `x` where `a` is 2 and 1000000007, `bx` the maximum of all `x` where `a` is 1 and -1, `a` the first integer from the input, `x` the second integer from the input, and `bx` less than or equal to `ax`. The variable `i` will be the last element in the set `cx` after the loop finishes.
