Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is a set containing one or more elements which are `x`, `tmp` is 0, stdin is empty. The maximum of `x` and -1 is less than or equal to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007.
Code of the loop:
for i in cx:
    if i >= bx and i <= ax:
        tmp += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is a set containing at least one element which is `x`, `i` is `x`, stdin is empty. The maximum of `x` and -1 is less than or equal to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), then `tmp` is 1; otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is a set containing at least two elements which are `x` and another element, `i` is the second element in the set `cx`, stdin is empty. The maximum of `x` and -1 is less than or equal to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), then `tmp` is 2; otherwise, `tmp` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is a set containing at least three elements which are `x`, the second element in the set `cx` and another element, `i` is the third element in the set `cx`, stdin is empty. The maximum of `x` and -1 is less than or equal to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), then `tmp` is 2; otherwise, `tmp` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
