Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `bx` has been updated to be the maximum of `x` and its previous value. The previous value of `bx` was the maximum of `x` and -1, so the new value of `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the maximum of `x` and -1, which simplifies to the maximum of `x` and -1. The other variables remain unchanged.
