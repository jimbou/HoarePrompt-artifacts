Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases if `a` is 2 otherwise `t-5` test cases, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `cx` is a set containing the integer `x` if `a` is 2 otherwise it is an empty set if `a` is 1, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 2 otherwise it is 1000000007 if `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1 otherwise it is -1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, and `x` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input.**
