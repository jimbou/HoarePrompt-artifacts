The only variables in the loop head are variables  `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `n`+1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer. If `a` is 1, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 1 and not 2, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. `i` is not defined, `tmp` is not defined, stdin is empty.**
