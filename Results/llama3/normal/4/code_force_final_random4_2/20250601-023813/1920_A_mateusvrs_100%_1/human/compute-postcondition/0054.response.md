Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is a list containing one element, `stdin` contains a space-separated list of integers (excluding the first two integers), `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an integer equal to 2, and `x` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ax` is updated to be the minimum of its original value (1000000007) and the value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged. The `stdin` now contains a space-separated list of integers, excluding the first two integers that were used to assign values to `a` and `x`.
