To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for i in cx:`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `cx` is a set containing all `x` values when `a` is not 1 and not 2, and it must have at least 2 elements. We also know that `i` is the second element in the set `cx`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `i` and `cx`. Since `i` is the second element in the set `cx`, we need to move to the next element in the set. Let's assume the next element in the set `cx` is `i'`.

The state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and the minimum of all `x` values when `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of -1 and the maximum of all `x` values when `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing all `x` values when `a` is not 1 and not 2 that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is `i'` (the next element in the set `cx`), `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is 2. Otherwise, `tmp` is 1.**

Note that we only adjusted the state of `i` and `cx`, as they are the only objects involved in the loop head. The other variables remain unchanged.
