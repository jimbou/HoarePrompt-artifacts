The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer n followed by n lines of two integers a and x. It then processes each test case by finding the maximum x value when a is 1, the minimum x value when a is 2, and the set of x values when a is not 1 or 2. If the maximum x value when a is 1 is greater than the minimum x value when a is 2, it appends 0 to the result list. Otherwise, it calculates the number of x values in the set that are within the range of the minimum and maximum x values and appends the difference between the maximum and minimum x values plus 1 minus this count to the result list. Finally, it prints the result list.
