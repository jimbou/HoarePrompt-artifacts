Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-5 test cases, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `cx` is a set containing the integer `x` if `a` is 2 otherwise it is a set containing the integer `x` if `a` is 1, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is 1 otherwise it is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1 otherwise it is -1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, and `x` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input.**

In this output state, the value of `cx` has been updated to include the integer `x` regardless of the value of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in `stdin` has decreased by 1.
