Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0, r is a list containing three elements, _ is n, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is an integer, x is an integer, ax is the minimum of 1000000007 and the minimum of all x values when a is 2, bx is the maximum of -1 and the maximum of all x values when a is 1, cx is a set containing all x values when a is not 1 and not 2. If bx > ax, then the current value of bx is greater than the current value of ax. Otherwise, i is the last element in the set cx, bx is less than or equal to ax, tmp is the number of elements in cx that are greater than or equal to bx and less than or equal to ax, and the last element in r is ax - bx + 1 - tmp.***
