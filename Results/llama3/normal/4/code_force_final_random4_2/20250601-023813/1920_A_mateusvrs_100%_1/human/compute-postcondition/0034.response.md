Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `tmp` is 0, stdin is empty, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `cx` is a set containing all integers `x` where `a` is not 1 or 2 and must have at least 1 element, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` where `a` is 2 and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` where `a` is 1 and -1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `x` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, and `i` is the first element in the set `cx`. The current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.**
