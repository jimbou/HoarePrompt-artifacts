Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is a set containing at least one element which is `x`, `i` is `x`, stdin is empty. The maximum of `x` and -1 is less than or equal to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), then `tmp` is 1; otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.***
