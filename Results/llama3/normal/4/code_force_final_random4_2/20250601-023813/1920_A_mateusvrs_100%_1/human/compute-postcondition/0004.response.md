Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, r is an empty list, stdin contains t-2 test cases, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 0, cx is an empty set, ax is 1000000007, bx is -1, a is an integer, x is an integer**

In this output state, the values of t, r, _, n, cx, ax, and bx remain unchanged. The stdin now contains t-2 test cases because one test case has been consumed by the input() function. The variables a and x are assigned integer values from the input, where a is the first integer and x is the second integer in the input.
