Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `r`, `_`, and `n` remain unchanged. The value of `a` is now the first integer from the input, and the value of `x` is the second integer from the input. The values of `bx` and `ax` are updated based on the new value of `x`. The value of `cx` is also updated to contain the new value of `x`. The stdin is now empty since the input has been consumed.
