Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is a list containing one element, `stdin` contains a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, and `x` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `r`, `_`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, and `bx` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `x` are updated to be the first and second integers from the input, respectively. The `stdin` is now empty, as the input has been consumed.
