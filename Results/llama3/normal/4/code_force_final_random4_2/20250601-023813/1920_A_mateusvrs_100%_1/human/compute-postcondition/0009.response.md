Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, stdin contains `t-2` test cases, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is 2, `x` is an integer.**

In this output state, the value of `ax` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value (1000000007) and the value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
