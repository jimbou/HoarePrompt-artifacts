Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `n`+1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set, `i` is not defined, `tmp` is not defined, `stdin` contains a space-separated list of integers.**

The code assigns the values of `a` and `x` to the integers from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin now contains a space-separated list of integers. The values of the other variables are not affected.
