To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(n):`. The objects involved are `_` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than the current value of `_`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `n` is an integer greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than the new value of `_`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `_` is 1
* `n` must be greater than 1

The other variables (`t`, `r`, `stdin`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`, `a`, and `x`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 otherwise it is a set containing the integer `x` if `a` is 2, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is 1 otherwise it is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1 otherwise it is -1, `a` is an integer, and `x` is an integer.**
