The only object in the loop head is variable  `cx`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `cx`.  If the set has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `cx` has at least 1 element which is `x`, `i` is `x`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the set must have at least 2 elements and `i` is the second element in the set.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is a set containing at least two elements which are `x` and another element, `i` is the second element in the set `cx`, stdin is empty. The maximum of `x` and -1 is less than or equal to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), then `tmp` is 1; otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.**
