Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `x` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 otherwise it is a set containing the integer `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1 otherwise it is the maximum of `x` and the maximum of `x` and -1, stdin contains `t-6` test cases if `a` is 1 otherwise `t-5` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `ax` has been updated to be the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. The other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin also remains the same, depending on the value of `a`.
