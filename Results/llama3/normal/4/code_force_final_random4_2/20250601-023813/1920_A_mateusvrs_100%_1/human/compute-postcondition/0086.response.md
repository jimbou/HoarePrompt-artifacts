Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is a set containing at least three elements which are `x`, the second element in the set `cx` and another element, `i` is the third element in the set `cx`, `tmp` is either 2 or 3 depending on whether `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), stdin is empty.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial properties. The only change is in the value of `tmp`, which is incremented by 1. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), `tmp` becomes 3; otherwise, it becomes 2.
