Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 otherwise it is a set containing the integer `x` if `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 1 otherwise it is the minimum of `x` and the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1 otherwise it is -1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, and `x` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ax` has been updated to be the minimum of `x` and its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ax` now depends on the value of `a`. If `a` is 1, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the minimum of `x` and 1000000007.
