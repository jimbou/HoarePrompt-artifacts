Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `n`+1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `i` is not defined, `tmp` is not defined, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers. If `a` is 1, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 1 and not 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`.**

In this output state, the value of `ax` has been updated to be the minimum of `x` and its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `bx` and `cx` are still dependent on the value of `a`.
