Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is a list containing one element, `stdin` contains a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. If `a` is equal to 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` is equal to 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not equal to 1 or 2, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is a set containing one element which is the second integer from the input.***
