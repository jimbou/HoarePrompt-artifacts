Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `tmp` is 2 if the second element in the set `cx` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `tmp` is 1, stdin is empty, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `cx` is a set containing all integers `x` where `a` is not 1 or 2 and must have at least 2 elements, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` where `a` is 2 and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` where `a` is 1 and -1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `x` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, and `i` is the second element in the set `cx`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `tmp` has been incremented by 1. If the second element in the set `cx` is within the range of `bx` and `ax`, `tmp` is now 2; otherwise, it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
