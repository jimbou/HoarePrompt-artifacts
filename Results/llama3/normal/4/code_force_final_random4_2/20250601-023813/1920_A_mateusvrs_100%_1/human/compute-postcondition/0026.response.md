Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `x` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input. If `a` is 2, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 otherwise it is a set containing the integer `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1 otherwise it is the maximum of `x` and the maximum of `x` and -1, stdin contains `t-6` test cases if `a` is 1 otherwise `t-5` test cases. If `a` is not 2, `cx` is a set containing the integer `x` if `a` is 1 otherwise it is a set containing the integer `x` if `x` is not already in `cx`, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is 1 otherwise it is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1 otherwise it is the maximum of `x` and the maximum of `x` and -1, stdin contains `t-6` test cases if `a` is 1 otherwise `t-5` test cases.***
