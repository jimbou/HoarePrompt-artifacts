Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It initializes the minimum and maximum possible values of k (bx and ax) and a set to store the values that k cannot be equal to (cx). It then iterates over the constraints, updating bx and ax accordingly and adding values to cx when necessary.

After processing all constraints, it checks if bx is greater than ax, which would mean that there are no possible values of k that satisfy all constraints, and appends 0 to the result list. Otherwise, it calculates the number of possible values of k by subtracting the number of values in cx that are within the range [bx, ax] from the total number of values in the range [bx, ax] (ax - bx + 1).

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when there are no possible values of k, when there are values of k that are not equal to any of the values in cx, and when there are values of k that are equal to some of the values in cx. The use of a set to store the values in cx ensures that duplicate values are ignored, which is in line with the problem description.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
