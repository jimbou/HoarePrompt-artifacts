Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `n`+1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1. If `a` is 1, `ax` is 1000000007. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is not 1 and not 2, `ax` is 1000000007. `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. `i` is not defined, `tmp` is not defined, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `cx` is now a set containing the integer `x`, regardless of the value of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
