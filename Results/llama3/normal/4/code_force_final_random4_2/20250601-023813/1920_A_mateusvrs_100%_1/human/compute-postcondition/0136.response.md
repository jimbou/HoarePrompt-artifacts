Output State: **t is 0, r is a list containing t elements, stdin is empty, _ is n, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is an integer, x is an integer, ax is the minimum of 1000000007 and the minimum of all x values when a is 2, bx is the maximum of -1 and the maximum of all x values when a is 1, cx is a set containing all x values when a is not 1 and not 2. If bx > ax, then the current value of bx is greater than the current value of ax. Otherwise, i is the last element in the set cx, bx is less than or equal to ax, tmp is the number of elements in cx that are greater than or equal to bx and less than or equal to ax, and the last element in r is ax - bx + 1 - tmp.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is as follows:

- The number of test cases `t` is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
- The list `r` contains `t` elements, which means it contains the results of all test cases.
- The standard input `stdin` is empty, indicating that all input data has been consumed.
- The loop variable `_` is equal to `n`, which is the number of elements in the current test case.
- The variables `a` and `x` are integers, which are the last values read from the input.
- The variables `ax` and `bx` are the minimum and maximum values of `x` when `a` is 2 and 1, respectively, or 1000000007 and -1 if no such values are found.
- The set `cx` contains all `x` values when `a` is not 1 or 2.
- If `bx` is greater than `ax`, then the current value of `bx` is greater than the current value of `ax`.
- Otherwise, `i` is the last element in the set `cx`, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that are within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), and the last element in `r` is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.
