Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is a set containing at least one element which is `x`, `i` is `x`, `tmp` is 1, stdin is empty. The maximum of `x` and -1 is less than or equal to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. The current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `tmp` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
