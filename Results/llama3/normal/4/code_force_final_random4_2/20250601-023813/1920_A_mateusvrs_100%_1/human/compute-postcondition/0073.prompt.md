Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 1, r is a list containing one element, stdin is empty, _ is n + 1, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, cx is an empty set, ax is 1000000007, bx is -1, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, and x is an integer equal to the second integer from the input.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    a, x = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 1:
        bx = max(x, bx)
    elif a == 2:
        ax = min(x, ax)
    else:
        cx.add(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is a list containing one element, `stdin` contains a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. If `a` is equal to 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` is equal to 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not equal to 1 or 2, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is a set containing one element which is the second integer from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`, stdin is empty. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x`, 1000000007 and the previous value of `ax`, `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `cx` is a set containing two elements which are `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x` if `a` is 1, otherwise `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x` if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing two elements which are `x` and `x`, stdin is empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
