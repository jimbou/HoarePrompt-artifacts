Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `tmp` is 0, stdin is empty, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `cx` is a set containing all integers `x` where `a` is not 1 or 2, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` where `a` is 2 and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` where `a` is 1 and -1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, and `x` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input. Additionally, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`.**

In this output state, a new variable `tmp` is introduced and assigned the value 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin remains empty. The relationships between the variables, such as `bx` being less than or equal to `ax`, are still valid.
