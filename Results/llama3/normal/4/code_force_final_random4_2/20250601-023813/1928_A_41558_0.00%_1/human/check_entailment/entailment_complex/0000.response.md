Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle, and then forming another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles.

The program first checks if both dimensions are odd, in which case it is not possible to form another rectangle, so it prints 'NO'. Then it checks if one dimension is twice the other, in which case it is also not possible to form another rectangle, so it prints 'NO'. For all other cases, it prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to form another rectangle.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
