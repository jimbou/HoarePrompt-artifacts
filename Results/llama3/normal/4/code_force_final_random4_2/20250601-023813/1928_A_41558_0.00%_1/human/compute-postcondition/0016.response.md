The code assigns the values of `a` and `b` from the input. The initial state already contains the values of `a` and `b`, but they are updated with the new values from the input. The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers from the input**
