Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers**.

In this output state, the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code. The code assigned the values of `a` and `b` to be integers, which were obtained from the input. The input was a space-separated list of integers, which was split and converted to integers using the `int` function. The specific values of `a` and `b` are not known, but they are integers.
