Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine if a given rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions. The program takes the dimensions of the original rectangle as input and outputs "YES" if a new rectangle can be formed and "NO" otherwise.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases (n) and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the rectangle (a and b) and checks if both a and b are odd. If they are, it prints "NO" because a rectangle with odd dimensions cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
3. If a and b are not both odd, the program checks if a is twice b or b is twice a. If either condition is true, it prints "NO" because the rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles with different dimensions.
4. If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints "YES" because the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles and rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
