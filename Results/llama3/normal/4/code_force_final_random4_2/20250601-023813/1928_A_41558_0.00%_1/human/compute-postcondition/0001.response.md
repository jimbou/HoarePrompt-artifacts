The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, since stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, it means that the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `n` to be at least 1 and `i` to be 0 (since it will start from 0 in the range).

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0**
