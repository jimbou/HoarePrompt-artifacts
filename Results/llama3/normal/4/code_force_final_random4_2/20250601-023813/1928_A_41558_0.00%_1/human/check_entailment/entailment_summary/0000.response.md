Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly handles all the possible cases where a rectangle can or cannot be partitioned into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. 

The program first checks if both dimensions are odd, in which case it is not possible to partition the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, so it prints 'NO'. 

Then, it checks if one dimension is twice the other, in which case it is also not possible to partition the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, so it prints 'NO'. 

For all other cases, it prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to partition the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.

Correctness: **True**
