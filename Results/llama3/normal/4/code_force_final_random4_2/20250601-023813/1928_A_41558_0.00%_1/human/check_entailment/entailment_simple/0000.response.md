Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it means that the rectangle cannot be cut into two rectangles with integer sides, so the program prints 'NO'.

2. If `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`, it means that the rectangle can only be cut into two rectangles of the same size, which are considered the same, so the program prints 'NO'.

3. In all other cases, the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides, and these two rectangles can be used to form another rectangle that is different from the original one, so the program prints 'YES'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
