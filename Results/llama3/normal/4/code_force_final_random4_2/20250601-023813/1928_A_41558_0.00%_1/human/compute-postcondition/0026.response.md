Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers from the input.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to be the two integers from the input. The conditions for printing 'NO' or 'YES' are still valid, but the specific values of `a` and `b` are now determined by the input.
