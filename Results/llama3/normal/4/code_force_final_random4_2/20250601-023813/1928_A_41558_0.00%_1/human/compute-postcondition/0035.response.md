Output State: **`n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n-1`, `a` and `b` are integers from the input. If both `a` and `b` are odd, 'NO' is printed. If `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the test cases (minus one) provided in the input, and for each test case, it has printed 'NO' if both numbers are odd or if one number is twice the other, and 'YES' otherwise. The loop has iterated `n` times, where `n` is the number of test cases minus one, and the variable `i` has reached the value `n-1`. The variables `a` and `b` have taken on the values of the last test case processed.
