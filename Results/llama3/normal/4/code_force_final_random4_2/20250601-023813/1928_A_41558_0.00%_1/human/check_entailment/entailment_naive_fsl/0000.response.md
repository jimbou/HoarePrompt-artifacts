Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is 3 3, the program prints 'NO', but the correct answer is 'YES'. This is because the program only checks if the rectangle can be cut into two equal rectangles, but it does not consider the case where the rectangle can be cut into two different rectangles that can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

In this case, the 3x3 rectangle can be cut into two 1x3 rectangles, which can then be rearranged to form a 2x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 3x3 rectangle. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this case.
