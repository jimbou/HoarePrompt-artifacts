Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is between 1 and `n - 2` (inclusive), `s` is a sorted list of integers containing all elements of `arr` with a 0 prepended to it, `ans` is 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `arr` is a list of integers. The difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)th` elements of `s` is less than or equal to 1.**

The code `ans ^= 1` flips the value of `ans` from 1 to 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)th` elements of `s` is still less than or equal to 1, and `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
