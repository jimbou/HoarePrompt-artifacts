Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `s` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements and a 0 prepended to it, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is greater than 1, `ans` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is less than or equal to 1.***
