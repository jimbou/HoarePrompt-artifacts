Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `s` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements and a 0 prepended to it, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is `n - 1`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. `ans` is 1 if the number of times the loop executes is even, otherwise `ans` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` is at least 3, `s` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements and a 0 prepended to it, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is `n - 1`, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The value of `ans` depends on the number of times the loop executes: if it executes an even number of times, `ans` is 1; otherwise, `ans` is 0.
