Postcondition: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `s` is a sorted list of integers starting with 0, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, Alice or Bob is printed depending on the value of `n` and the number of iterations and gaps in `s`.**
