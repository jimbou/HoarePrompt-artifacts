The only variables in the loop head are the variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the expression `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `int(input())` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
