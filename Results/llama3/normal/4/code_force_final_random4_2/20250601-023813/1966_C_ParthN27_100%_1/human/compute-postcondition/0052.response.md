Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `s` is a sorted list of integers starting with 0, `ans` is 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, Alice or Bob is printed depending on the value of `n` and the number of iterations and gaps in `s`. The current value of `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is greater than 1***
