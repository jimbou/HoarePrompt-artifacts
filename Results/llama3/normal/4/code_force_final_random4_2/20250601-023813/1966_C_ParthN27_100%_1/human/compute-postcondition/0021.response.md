Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is between 2 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `s` is a sorted list of integers containing all elements of `arr` with a 0 prepended to it, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `arr` is a list of integers, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The break statement does not change the values of any variables, it only terminates the execution of the innermost loop or conditional statement.
