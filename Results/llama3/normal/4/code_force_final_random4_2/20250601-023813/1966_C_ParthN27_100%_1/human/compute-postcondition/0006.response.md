To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` is greater than 1, it must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables, `arr`, `s`, `stdin`, and `_`, are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing the first two elements of `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 2**
