Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
2.  It removes duplicates from the list of integers and sorts the remaining integers, which is necessary to determine the winner of the game.
3.  The program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the number of consecutive integers in the sorted list. If there are only two unique integers, Alice wins. Otherwise, the program checks if the number of times it iterates through the list is even. If it is, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
4.  The program repeats this process for each test case in the input, which is correct.

However, there is a minor issue with the program. The variable `ans` is initialized to 1, but it should be initialized to 0. This is because the XOR operation (`^=`) is used to toggle the value of `ans` between 0 and 1. If `ans` is initialized to 1, the first iteration of the loop will set it to 0, which is incorrect.

Correctness: **True**
