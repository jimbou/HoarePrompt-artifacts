Postcondition: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is between 1 and `n - 2` (inclusive), `s` is a sorted list of integers containing all elements of `arr` with a 0 prepended to it, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `arr` is a list of integers. If the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)th` elements of `s` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 1, `_` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is 0, `_` is 0, and the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)th` elements of `s` is less than or equal to 1.**
