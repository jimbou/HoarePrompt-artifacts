The code adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. The value of `i` is 0, so the element added to the set is the first element of the list `arr`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing the first element of `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 0**
