Postcondition: ***n is the length of s, s is a sorted list of integers containing all elements of arr with a 0 prepended to it, ans is 1, i is n-1, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, arr is a list of integers. If n is 2, 'Alice' is printed. If n is at least 3, 'Alice' is printed if the number of iterations is odd and no gaps larger than 1 are found in s, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.***
