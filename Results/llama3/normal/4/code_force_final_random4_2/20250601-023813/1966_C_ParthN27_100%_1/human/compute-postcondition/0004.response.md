The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing the first element of `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 1**
