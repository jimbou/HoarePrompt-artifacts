Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It removes duplicates from the list, sorts the remaining integers, and then determines the winner of a game based on the number of consecutive integers in the sorted list. If there are only two unique integers, the function prints 'Alice'. Otherwise, it prints 'Alice' if the number of times it iterates through the list is even, and 'Bob' otherwise. The function repeats this process for each test case in the input.**
