Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `s` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements and a 0 prepended to it, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `_` is 1, `ans` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `s`, `arr`, `i`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is set to 1, indicating that the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is greater than 1. Additionally, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.
