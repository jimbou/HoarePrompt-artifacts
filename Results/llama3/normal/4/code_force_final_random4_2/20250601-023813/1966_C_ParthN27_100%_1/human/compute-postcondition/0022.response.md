Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is between 2 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `s` is a sorted list of integers containing all elements of `arr` with a 0 prepended to it, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `arr` is a list of integers, `ans` is either 1 or 0, `_` is 0**

The code `ans ^= 1` flips the value of `ans`, which means if `ans` was 0, it becomes 1, and if it was 1, it becomes 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
