According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, which means it is already at least 1. However, to ensure the loop executes at least once, we can adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 0 and `i` to be 0 (since the loop starts from 0).

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is an empty set, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 0**
