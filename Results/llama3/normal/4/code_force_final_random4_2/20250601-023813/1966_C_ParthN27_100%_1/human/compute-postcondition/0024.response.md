To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is between 2 and `n - 1` (inclusive), and `n` is at least 4.

To execute the loop again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes between 3 and `n` (inclusive). Also, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `i`, so `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is at least 5, `i` is between 3 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `s` is a sorted list of integers containing all elements of `arr` with a 0 prepended to it, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `arr` is a list of integers, `_` is 0. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `ans` is either 0 or 1. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1 or 0.**
