Postcondition: ***n is the number of elements in s plus 1, s is a sorted list of integers starting with 0, ans is 1, i is n-1, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If n is 2, 'Alice' is printed. If n is at least 3, the loop has finished executing, and the program has either printed "Alice" if ans is 1 or "Bob" if ans is 0, depending on the value of n and the number of iterations and gaps in s.***
