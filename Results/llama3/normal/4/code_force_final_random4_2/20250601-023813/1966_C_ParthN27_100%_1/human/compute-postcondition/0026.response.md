Output State: **`n` is at least 5, `i` is between 3 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `s` is a sorted list of integers containing all elements of `arr` with a 0 prepended to it, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `arr` is a list of integers, `_` is 0. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `ans` is either 1 or 0 if it was 0, or 0 or 1 if it was 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been toggled, i.e., if it was 0, it is now 1, and if it was 1, it is now 0. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
