Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `s` is a sorted list of integers starting with 0, `ans` is either 1 or 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been flipped, i.e., if it was 0, it is now 1, and if it was 1, it is now 0. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.
