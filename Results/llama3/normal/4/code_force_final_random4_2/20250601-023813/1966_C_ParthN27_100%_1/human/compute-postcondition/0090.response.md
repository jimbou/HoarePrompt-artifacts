Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `s` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements and a 0 prepended to it, `ans` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The condition `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is still greater than 1, and `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
