Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *n is the length of the sorted list s plus 1, s is the sorted list of integers from the original set s with a 0 prepended to it, ans is 1, arr is a list of integers, i is undefined, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, and n is not equal to 2
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:
        break
    else:
        ans ^= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is at least 3, `s` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements and a 0 prepended to it, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is less than or equal to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is at least 4, `s` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements and a 0 prepended to it, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is greater than 1, `ans` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is less than or equal to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is at least 4, `s` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements and a 0 prepended to it, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is 3, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is the opposite of its previous value (1 if it was 0, 0 if it was 1).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
