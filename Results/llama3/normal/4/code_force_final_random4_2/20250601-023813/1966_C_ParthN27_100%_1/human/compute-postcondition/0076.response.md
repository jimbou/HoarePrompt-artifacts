To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `i` is initialized to `n-1`, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 1, and `i` will be adjusted accordingly.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is an empty set, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `ans` is 1, `i` is 0, `_` is 1**
