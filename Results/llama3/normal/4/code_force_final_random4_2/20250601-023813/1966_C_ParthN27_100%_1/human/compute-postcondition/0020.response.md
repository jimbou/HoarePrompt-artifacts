To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is between 1 and `n - 2` (inclusive), and `n` is at least 3.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes between 2 and `n - 1` (inclusive). The value of `n` remains the same, but we can refine the lower bound of `n` to be at least 4, since `i` is now at least 2.

The other variables, such as `s`, `stdin`, `arr`, `ans`, and `_`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is between 2 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `s` is a sorted list of integers containing all elements of `arr` with a 0 prepended to it, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `arr` is a list of integers, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 0**
