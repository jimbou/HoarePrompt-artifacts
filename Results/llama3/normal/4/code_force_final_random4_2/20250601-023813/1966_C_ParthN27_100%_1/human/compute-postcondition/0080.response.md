To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for i in range(n):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` is greater than 1, it must also be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables in the state (`arr`, `s`, `stdin`, `ans`, and `_`) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing the first two elements of `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `ans` is 1, `i` is 2, `_` is 1**
