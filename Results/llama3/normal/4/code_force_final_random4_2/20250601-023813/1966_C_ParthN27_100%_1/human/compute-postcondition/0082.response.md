Output State: **`n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing all elements of `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `ans` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is 1**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the set `s` will contain all elements from the list `arr`, and the loop counter `i` will be at the last index of the list (`n-1`). The other variables remain unchanged.
