Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` contains the integer at index `i` of `arr`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, Alice or Bob is printed depending on the value of n and the number of iterations and gaps in s**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the integer at index `i` of `arr`, which is the current element being processed. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The printing of Alice or Bob still depends on the value of `n` and the number of iterations and gaps in `s`.
