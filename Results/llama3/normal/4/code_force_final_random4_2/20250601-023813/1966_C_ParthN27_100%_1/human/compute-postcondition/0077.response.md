The code adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Since `i` is 0, the first element of `arr` is added to `s`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing the first element of `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `ans` is 1, `i` is 0, `_` is 1**
