Postcondition: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 1`, `s` is a sorted list of integers containing all elements of `arr` with a 0 prepended to it, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `arr` is a list of integers, `_` is 0. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` at any point, `ans` is either 0 or 1. Otherwise, `ans` is either 0 or 1, depending on whether the number of iterations is even or odd. The current value of `ans` is 1.**
