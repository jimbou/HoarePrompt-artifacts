Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `s` is a sorted list of integers starting with 0, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If the difference between the second and first elements of `s` is greater than 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with `ans` being either 0 or 1.***
