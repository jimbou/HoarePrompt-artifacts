Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `s` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements and a 0 prepended to it, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is 3, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `ans` is the opposite of its previous value (1 if it was 0, 0 if it was 1)**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been toggled, meaning it has been changed to the opposite of its previous value. If `ans` was 0 before, it is now 1, and if it was 1 before, it is now 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
