Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `s` is a sorted list of integers starting with 0, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `s`, `ans`, and `_` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
