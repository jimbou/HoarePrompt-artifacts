Output State: **n is a positive integer, arr is a list of integers, s is an empty set, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` becomes a positive integer. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `arr`. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The third line initializes an empty set `s`. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0.
