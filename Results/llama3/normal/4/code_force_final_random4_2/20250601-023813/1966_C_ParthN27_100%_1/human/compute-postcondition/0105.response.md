Output: **`n` is at least 3, `s` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements and a 0 prepended to it, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is `n - 1`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The number of times the loop executes is even, so `ans` is 1, and 'Alice' is being printed**
