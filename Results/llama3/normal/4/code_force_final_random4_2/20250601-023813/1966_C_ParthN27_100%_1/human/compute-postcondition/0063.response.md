Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `s` is a sorted list of integers starting with 0, `ans` is either 1 or 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.**

The code `ans ^= 1` flips the value of `ans` from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0. Since the initial state of `ans` is either 0 or 1, after executing the code, `ans` will be the opposite of its initial value. The other variables remain unchanged.
