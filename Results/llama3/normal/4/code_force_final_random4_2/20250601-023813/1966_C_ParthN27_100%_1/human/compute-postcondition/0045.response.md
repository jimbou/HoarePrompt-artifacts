Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` contains all the integers in `arr`, `ans` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, Alice or Bob is printed depending on the value of `n` and the number of iterations and gaps in `s`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the set `s` will contain all the integers from the list `arr`, and the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, which is the last index of the list `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
