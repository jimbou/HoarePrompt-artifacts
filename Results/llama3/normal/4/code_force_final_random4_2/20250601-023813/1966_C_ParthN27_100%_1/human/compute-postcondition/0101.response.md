Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `s` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements and a 0 prepended to it, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is 3, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is the opposite of its previous value (1 if it was 0, 0 if it was 1).***
