Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The number of test cases is given in the first line of the input.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = set()
    for i in range(n):
        s.add(arr[i])
    s = list(s)
    s.sort()
    s = [0] + s
    ans = 1
    n = len(s)
    if n == 2:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:
                break
            else:
                ans ^= 1
        if ans:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is the length of s, s is a sorted list of integers containing all elements of arr with a 0 prepended to it, ans is 1, i is n-1, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, arr is a list of integers. If n is 2, 'Alice' is printed. If n is at least 3, 'Alice' is printed if the number of iterations is odd and no gaps larger than 1 are found in s, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is the number of elements in s plus 1, s is a sorted list of integers starting with 0, ans is 1, i is n-1, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If n is 2, 'Alice' is printed. If n is at least 3, the loop has finished executing, and the program has either printed "Alice" if ans is 1 or "Bob" if ans is 0, depending on the value of n and the number of iterations and gaps in s.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is the length of the sorted list s plus 1, s is the sorted list of integers from the original set s with a 0 prepended to it, ans is 1, arr is a list of integers, i is undefined, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If n is 2, 'Alice' is printed. If n is at least 3, 'Alice' is printed if the number of times the loop executes is even, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
