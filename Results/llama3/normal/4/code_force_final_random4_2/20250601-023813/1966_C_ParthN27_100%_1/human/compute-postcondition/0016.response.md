Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is between 1 and `n - 2` (inclusive), `s` is a sorted list of integers containing all elements of `arr` with a 0 prepended to it, `ans` is 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `arr` is a list of integers and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables. The current value of `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is still greater than 1. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.
