Postcondition: ***n is the length of the sorted list s plus 1, s is the sorted list of integers from the original set s with a 0 prepended to it, ans is 1, arr is a list of integers, i is undefined, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If n is 2, 'Alice' is printed. If n is at least 3, 'Alice' is printed if the number of times the loop executes is even, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.***
