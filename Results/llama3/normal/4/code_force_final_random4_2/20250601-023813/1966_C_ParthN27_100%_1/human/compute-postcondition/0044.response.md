Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` contains the integer at index `i` of `arr` and the integer at index `i` of `arr` and the integer at index `i` of `arr`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 2, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, Alice or Bob is printed depending on the value of n and the number of iterations and gaps in s**

The code adds the integer at index `i` of `arr` to the set `s`. The value of `i` is 2, so the integer at index 2 of `arr` is added to `s`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The output of the program, either Alice or Bob, depends on the value of `n` and the number of iterations and gaps in `s`.
