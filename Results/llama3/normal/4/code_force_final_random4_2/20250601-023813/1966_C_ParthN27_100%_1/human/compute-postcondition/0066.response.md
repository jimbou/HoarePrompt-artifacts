Postcondition: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is a sorted list of integers starting with 0, `ans` is 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The loop has finished executing, and the program has either printed "Alice" or "Bob" depending on the value of `n` and the number of iterations and gaps in `s`.**
