Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `i` is between 2 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `s` is a sorted list of integers containing all elements of `arr` with a 0 prepended to it, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `arr` is a list of integers, `_` is 0. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `ans` is either 0 or 1. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1 or 0.***
