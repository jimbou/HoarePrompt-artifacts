Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `s` is a sorted list of integers starting with 0, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is greater than 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the same values for `n`, `i`, `s`, `ans`, `_`, and `stdin`.***
