Output State: **n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is an empty set, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, ans is 1, i is n-1, _ is 1**.

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, which is now an integer. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `arr`, making `arr` a list of integers. The third line initializes an empty set `s`. The value of `ans` remains 1, `i` remains `n-1`, and `_` remains 1. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.
