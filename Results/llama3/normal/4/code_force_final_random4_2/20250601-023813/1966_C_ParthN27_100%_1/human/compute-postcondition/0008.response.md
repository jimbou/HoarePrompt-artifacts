Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing all elements of `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the set `s` will contain all elements from the list `arr`, and the loop counter `i` will be one less than the total number of elements in `arr` (since indexing starts at 0). The other variables remain unchanged.
