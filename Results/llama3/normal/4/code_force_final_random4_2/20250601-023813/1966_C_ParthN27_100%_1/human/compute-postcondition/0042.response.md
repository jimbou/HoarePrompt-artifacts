Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` contains the integer at index `i` of `arr` and the integer at index `i` of `arr`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, Alice or Bob is printed depending on the value of n and the number of iterations and gaps in s**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been updated to include the integer at index `i` of `arr` in addition to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The value of `n`, `arr`, `ans`, `i`, and `_` are still the same. The output of Alice or Bob is still dependent on the value of `n` and the number of iterations and gaps in `s`.
