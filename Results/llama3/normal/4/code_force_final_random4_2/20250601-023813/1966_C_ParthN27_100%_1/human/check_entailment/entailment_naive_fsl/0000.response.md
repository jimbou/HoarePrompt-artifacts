Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The issue lies in the way it calculates the answer. The program uses the XOR operation to determine the winner, but this approach is incorrect.

The correct approach is to find the minimum number of stones in the piles and then check if the number of piles with this minimum number of stones is odd or even. If it's odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

Here's a counterexample:

Input:

3
1 2 3

The program outputs "Alice", but the correct output is "Bob". The minimum number of stones in the piles is 1, and there is only one pile with this number of stones, so Bob wins.

The correct code should be:

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        min_stones = min(arr)
        count = arr.count(min_stones)
        if count % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')
