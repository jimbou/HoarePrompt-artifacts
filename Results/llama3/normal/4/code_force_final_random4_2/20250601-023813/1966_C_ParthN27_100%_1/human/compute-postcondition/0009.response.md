Output State: **n is the length of s, s is a sorted list of integers containing all elements of arr with a 0 prepended to it, ans is 1, i is n-1, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, arr is a list of integers**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to be the length of the sorted list `s`, which contains all elements of `arr` with a 0 prepended to it. The value of `ans` is 1, and the value of `i` is `n-1`. The value of `_` remains 0. The state of `stdin` remains the same, containing multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The state of `arr` also remains the same, being a list of integers.
