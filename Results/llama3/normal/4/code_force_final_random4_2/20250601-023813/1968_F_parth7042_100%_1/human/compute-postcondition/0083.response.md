Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 1], q is an integer equal to the value of data[index], a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the value of data[index - 1 + i - 1] for 1 <= i <= n and all other elements are 0, pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the XOR of the value of data[index - 1 + j - 1] for 1 <= j <= i and all other elements are 0, mp is a dictionary with n+1 key-value pairs where the key is the XOR of the value of data[index - 1 + j - 1] for 1 <= j <= i and the value is a list containing only i for 1 <= i <= n, index is incremented by n, data remains unchanged, i is n, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q times, v1 is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, v2 is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, it1 is an integer representing the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is an integer representing the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1, l is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 1], r is an integer equal to the value of data[index], x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1].**

This output state describes the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop iterates from 1 to n, and in each iteration, it updates the variables a, pf, and mp based on the values in the data list. The variable index is incremented by n, and the variable i is set to n. The other variables remain unchanged.
