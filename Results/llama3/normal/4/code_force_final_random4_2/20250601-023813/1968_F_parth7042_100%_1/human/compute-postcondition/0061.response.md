Postcondition: **t is at least 2, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer that must be greater than 1, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is an integer for all i in range(1, n+1), pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the XOR of the element at index i in a and the element at index i-1 in pf for all i in range(1, n+1), mp is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the XOR of the element at index 1 in pf and the value is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, index is incremented by 2, data remains unchanged, i is n, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q+2 times, v1 is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, v2 is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, it1 is an integer representing the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is an integer representing the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1. Either the current value of it1 is less than the length of v1, the current value of it2 is greater than or equal to 0, and the current value of v1[it1] is less than the current value of v2[it2], or it1 is equal to or greater than the length of v1, or it2 is less than 0, or v1[it1] is not less than v2[it2], l is an integer, r is an integer, x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1]. If x is equal to 0, then results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q+3 times.**
