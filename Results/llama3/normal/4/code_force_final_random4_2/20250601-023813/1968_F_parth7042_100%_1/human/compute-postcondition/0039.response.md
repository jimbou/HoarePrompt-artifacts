Output State: **t is at least 2, n is an integer, q is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of n+1 elements where all elements are 0, pf is a list of n+1 elements where all elements are 0, mp is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is 0 and the value is a list containing 0, index is incremented by 2*q, data remains unchanged, i is n, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q times**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `data`, `i`, and `results` remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of `n` is updated to an integer value read from `data[index]`, and the value of `q` is updated to an integer value read from `data[index + 1]`. The value of `index` is incremented by 2*q. The list `a` is initialized with `n+1` elements, all set to 0. The list `pf` is also initialized with `n+1` elements, all set to 0. The dictionary `mp` is initialized with one key-value pair, where the key is 0 and the value is a list containing 0.
