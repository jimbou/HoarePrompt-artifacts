Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer, q is an integer that must be greater than 1, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the integer value of data at index i, pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the XOR of the element at index i-1 and the element at index i in a, mp is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is the value of pf at index i and the value is a list containing at least the element i, index is incremented by 2, data remains unchanged, i is n, l is the integer value of data at index index - 2, r is the integer value of data at index index - 1, x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1], v1 is a list containing at least the element l, v2 is a list containing at least the element r - 1, it1 is the insertion point of l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point of r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1, results is a list that now contains the string 'YES' appended to its end.**

The code block appends the string 'YES' to the results list, leaving all other variables unchanged. The continue statement does not affect the state of the program.
