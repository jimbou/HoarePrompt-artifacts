Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 zeros, pf is a list of n+1 zeros, mp is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where key is 0 and value is a list containing a single element 0, index is incremented by 2, data remains unchanged, results remains an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is greater than 0, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is an integer, pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is the XOR of the element at index 0 and the element at index 1 in a, mp is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is the value of pf at index 1 and the value is a list containing at least the element 1, index is incremented by 2, data remains unchanged, results remains an empty list, i is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is at least 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is greater than 1, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is an integer and the element at index i is the integer value of data at index, pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is the XOR of the element at index 0 and the element at index 1 in a and the element at index i is the XOR of the element at index i-1 and the element at index i in a, mp is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is the value of pf at index 1 and the value is a list containing at least the element 1 and the element i, index is incremented by 2, data remains unchanged, results remains an empty list, i is 2

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is at least 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is greater than 2, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is an integer and the element at index i is the integer value of data at index, pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is the XOR of the element at index 0 and the element at index 1 in a and the element at index i is the XOR of the element at index i-1 and the element at index i in a, mp is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is the value of pf at index 1 and the value is a list containing at least the element 1 and the element i, index is incremented by 1, data remains unchanged, results remains an empty list, i is 3, a[i] is the integer value of data at index, pf[i] is the XOR of pf[i-1] and a[i], mp[pf[i]] contains i.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
