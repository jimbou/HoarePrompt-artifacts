Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the results of queries to stdout. It accepts a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers (n and q) followed by a list of n integers and q pairs of integers (l and r). The function then performs XOR operations on the list of integers and uses the results to determine the answers to the queries. The answers are either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether a certain condition is met, and are printed to stdout, one per line, for a total of q*t lines.**
