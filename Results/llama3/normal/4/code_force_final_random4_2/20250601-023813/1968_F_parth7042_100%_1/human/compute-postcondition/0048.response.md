Output State: **t is at least 2, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer that must be greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is an integer for all i in range(1, n+1), pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the XOR of the element at index i in a and the element at index i-1 in pf for all i in range(1, n+1), mp is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the XOR of the element at index 1 in pf and the value is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, index is incremented by 2, data remains unchanged, i is n, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q times, _ is 0, l is an integer equal to the value at index in data, r is an integer equal to the value at index + 1 in data, x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1].**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `i`, `results`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `index` is incremented by 2, and the values of `l` and `r` are assigned the integers at indices `index` and `index + 1` in `data`, respectively. The value of `x` is calculated as the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`.
