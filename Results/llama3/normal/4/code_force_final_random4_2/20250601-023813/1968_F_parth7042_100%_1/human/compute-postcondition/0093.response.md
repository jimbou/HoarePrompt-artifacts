Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data[index - 3]`, `q` is an integer equal to the value of `data[index - 2]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n+1` elements where the element at index `i` is the value of `data[index - 3 + i - 1]` for `1 <= i <= n` and all other elements are 0, `pf` is a list of `n+1` elements where the element at index `i` is the XOR of the value of `data[index - 3 + j - 1]` for `1 <= j <= i` and all other elements are 0, `mp` is a dictionary with `n+1` key-value pairs where the key is the XOR of the value of `data[index - 3 + j - 1]` for `1 <= j <= i` and the value is a list containing only `i` for `1 <= i <= n`, `index` is incremented by 2, `data` remains unchanged, `i` is `n`, `results` is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end `q` times and 'NO' is appended to its end, `v1` is a list containing only the value of `i` where `pf[r]` is the XOR of the value of `data[index - 3 + j - 1]` for `1 <= j <= i`, `v2` is a list containing only the value of `i` where `pf[l - 1]` is the XOR of the value of `data[index - 3 + j - 1]` for `1 <= j <= i`, `it1` is an integer representing the insertion point for `l` in `v1` to maintain sorted order, `it2` is an integer representing the insertion point for `r` in `v2` to maintain sorted order minus 1, `l` is an integer equal to the value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is an integer equal to the value of `data[index - 1]`, and either `it1` is equal to or larger than the length of `v1` or `it2` is less than 0 or (`v1[it1]` is larger than or equal to `v2[it2]`).**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that 'NO' is appended to the end of the `results` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
