Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 2, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is an integer for all i in range(1, n+1), pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the XOR of the element at index i in a and the element at index i-1 in pf for all i in range(1, n+1), mp is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the XOR of the element at index 1 in pf and the value is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, index is incremented by n, data remains unchanged, i is n, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q times.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[index])
    r = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp[pf[r]]
    v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
    it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is at least 2, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer that must be greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is an integer for all i in range(1, n+1), pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the XOR of the element at index i in a and the element at index i-1 in pf for all i in range(1, n+1), mp is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the XOR of the element at index 1 in pf and the value is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, index is incremented by 2, data remains unchanged, i is n, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q+1 times, v1 is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, v2 is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, it1 is an integer representing the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is an integer representing the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1. Either the current value of it1 is less than the length of v1, the current value of it2 is greater than or equal to 0, and the current value of v1[it1] is less than the current value of v2[it2], or it1 is equal to or greater than the length of v1, or it2 is less than 0, or v1[it1] is not less than v2[it2].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is at least 2, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer that must be greater than 1, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is an integer for all i in range(1, n+1), pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the XOR of the element at index i in a and the element at index i-1 in pf for all i in range(1, n+1), mp is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the XOR of the element at index 1 in pf and the value is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, index is incremented by 2, data remains unchanged, i is n, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q+3 times, v1 is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, v2 is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, it1 is an integer representing the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is an integer representing the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1. Either the current value of it1 is less than the length of v1, the current value of it2 is greater than or equal to 0, and the current value of v1[it1] is less than the current value of v2[it2], or it1 is equal to or greater than the length of v1, or it2 is less than 0, or v1[it1] is not less than v2[it2], l is an integer, r is an integer, x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1]. If x is equal to 0, then results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q+3 times.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is at least 2, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer that must be greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is an integer for all i in range(1, n+1), pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the XOR of the element at index i in a and the element at index i-1 in pf for all i in range(1, n+1), mp is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the XOR of the element at index 1 in pf and the value is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, index is incremented by 2, data remains unchanged, i is n, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q+3 times, v1 is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, v2 is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, it1 is an integer representing the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is an integer representing the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1. Either the current value of it1 is less than the length of v1, the current value of it2 is greater than or equal to 0, and the current value of v1[it1] is less than the current value of v2[it2], or it1 is equal to or greater than the length of v1, or it2 is less than 0, or v1[it1] is not less than v2[it2], l is an integer equal to the value of data[index], r is an integer equal to the value of data[index + 1], x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1]. If x is equal to 0, then results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q+3 times. Otherwise, results remains a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q+2 times. If it1 is less than the length of v1 and it2 is greater than or equal to 0 and v1[it1] is less than v2[it2], then results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q+3 times. Otherwise, results remains a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q+2 times.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
