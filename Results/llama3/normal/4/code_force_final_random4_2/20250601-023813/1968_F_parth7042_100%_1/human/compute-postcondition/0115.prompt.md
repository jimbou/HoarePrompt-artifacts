You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and q, followed by a list of n integers, followed by q pairs of integers l and r. All integers are non-negative and 1 <= l < r <= n.
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])

            it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1

                results.append('YES')
            else:
                results.append('NO')
        
    #State: t is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the integer value of data at index i, pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the XOR of the element at index i-1 and the element at index i in a, mp is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is the value of pf at index i and the value is a list containing at least the element i, index is incremented by 2*q*t, data remains unchanged, i is n, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q*t times.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: A list of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, each on a new line, where the total number of strings is q*t, indicating the results of q*t queries

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
