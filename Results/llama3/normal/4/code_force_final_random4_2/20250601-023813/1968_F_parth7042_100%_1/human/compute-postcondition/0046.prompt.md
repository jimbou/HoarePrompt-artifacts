Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 2, n is an integer, q is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of n+1 elements where all elements are 0, pf is a list of n+1 elements where all elements are 0, mp is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is 0 and the value is a list containing 0, index is incremented by 2*q, data remains unchanged, i is n, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q times
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 2, n is an integer that must be greater than 0, q is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is an integer and all other elements are 0, pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is the XOR of the element at index 1 in a and the element at index 0 in pf, and all other elements are 0, mp is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the XOR of the element at index 1 in pf and the value is a list containing 0 and 1, index is incremented by 2*q + 1, data remains unchanged, i is 1, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q times.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is at least 2, n is an integer that must be greater than 0, q is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is an integer and the element at index i is an integer, and all other elements are 0, pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is the XOR of the element at index 1 in a and the element at index 0 in pf, the element at index i is the XOR of the element at index i in a and the element at index i-1 in pf, and all other elements are 0, mp is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the XOR of the element at index 1 in pf and the value is a list containing 0, 1, and i, index is incremented by 2*q + 2, data remains unchanged, i is 2, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q times

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is at least 2, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, q is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is an integer and the element at index i is an integer, and all other elements are 0, pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is the XOR of the element at index 1 in a and the element at index 0 in pf, the element at index i is the XOR of the element at index i in a and the element at index i-1 in pf, and all other elements are 0, mp is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the XOR of the element at index 1 in pf and the value is a list containing 0, 1, and i, index is incremented by 1, data remains unchanged, i is 3, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q times, a[i] is the integer value of data[index-1], pf[i] is the XOR of pf[i-1] and a[i], and mp[pf[i]] is a list containing 0, 1, i.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
