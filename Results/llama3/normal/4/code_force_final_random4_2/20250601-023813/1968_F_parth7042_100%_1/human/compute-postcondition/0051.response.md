Postcondition: ***t is at least 2, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer that must be greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is an integer for all i in range(1, n+1), pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the XOR of the element at index i in a and the element at index i-1 in pf for all i in range(1, n+1), mp is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the XOR of the element at index 1 in pf and the value is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, index is incremented by 2, data remains unchanged, i is n, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q times. If x is 0, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q+1 times.***
