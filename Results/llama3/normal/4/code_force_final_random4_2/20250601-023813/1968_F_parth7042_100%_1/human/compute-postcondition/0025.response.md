Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer, q is an integer that must be greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the integer value of data at index i, pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the XOR of the element at index i-1 and the element at index i in a, mp is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is the value of pf at index i and the value is a list containing at least the element i, index is incremented by 2, data remains unchanged, i is n, l is the integer value of data at index index, r is the integer value of data at index index + 1, x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1], v1 is a list containing at least the element l, v2 is a list containing at least the element r - 1, it1 is the insertion point of l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point of r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1, results is a list that now contains the string 'YES' appended to its end if x is 0, otherwise results is a list containing the string 'NO'.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `mp[pf[r]]` to `v1` and the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]` to `v2`. Since `mp` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is the value of `pf` at index `i` and the value is a list containing at least the element `i`, `v1` and `v2` are lists containing at least the elements `l` and `r - 1` respectively. The code then assigns the insertion point of `l` in `v1` to maintain sorted order to `it1` and the insertion point of `r` in `v2` to maintain sorted order minus 1 to `it2`. No other variables are affected.
