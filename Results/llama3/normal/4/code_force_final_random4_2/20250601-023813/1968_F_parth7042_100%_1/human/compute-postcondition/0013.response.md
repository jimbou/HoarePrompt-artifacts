Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer, q is an integer that must be greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the integer value of data at index, pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the XOR of the element at index i-1 and the element at index i in a, mp is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is the value of pf at index i and the value is a list containing at least the element i, index is incremented by 2, data remains unchanged, results is a list containing the string 'YES', i is n, l is the integer value of data at index, r is the integer value of data at index + 1, x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1], and the current value of x is 0.**

The code block appends the string 'YES' to the results list and then continues to the next iteration of the loop. The continue statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration. 

The results list, which was initially empty, now contains the string 'YES'. All other variables remain unchanged.
