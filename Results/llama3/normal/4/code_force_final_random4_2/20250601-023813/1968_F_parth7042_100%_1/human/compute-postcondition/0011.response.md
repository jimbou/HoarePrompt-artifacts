Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer, q is an integer that must be greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the integer value of data at index, pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the XOR of the element at index i-1 and the element at index i in a, mp is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is the value of pf at index i and the value is a list containing at least the element i, index is incremented by 2, data remains unchanged, results remains an empty list, i is n, l is the integer value of data at index, r is the integer value of data at index + 1, x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1].**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `data`, and `results` remain unchanged. The value of `index` is incremented by 2, and the values of `l` and `r` are assigned the integer values of `data` at `index` and `index + 1`, respectively. The value of `x` is calculated as the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`.
