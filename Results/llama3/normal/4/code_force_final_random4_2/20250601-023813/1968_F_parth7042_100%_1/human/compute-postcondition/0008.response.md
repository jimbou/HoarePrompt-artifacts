Output State: **t is at least 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is greater than 2, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is an integer and the element at index i is the integer value of data at index, pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is the XOR of the element at index 0 and the element at index 1 in a and the element at index i is the XOR of the element at index i-1 and the element at index i in a, mp is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is the value of pf at index 1 and the value is a list containing at least the element 1 and the element i, index is incremented by 1, data remains unchanged, results remains an empty list, i is 3, a[i] is the integer value of data at index, pf[i] is the XOR of pf[i-1] and a[i], mp[pf[i]] contains i.**
