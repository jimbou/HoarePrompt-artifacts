Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer, q is an integer that must be greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the integer value of data at index i, pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the XOR of the element at index i-1 and the element at index i in a, mp is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is the value of pf at index i and the value is a list containing at least the element i, index is incremented by 2, data remains unchanged, i is n, l is the integer value of data at index index, r is the integer value of data at index index + 1, x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1], v1 is a list containing at least the element l, v2 is a list containing at least the element r - 1, it1 is the insertion point of l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point of r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1, results is a list that now contains the string 'YES' appended to its end.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `results.append('YES')` and `continue`. The first line appends the string 'YES' to the end of the `results` list. The second line, `continue`, skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. 

Since the `continue` statement does not affect any variables, the only change in the output state is the appending of 'YES' to the `results` list. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
