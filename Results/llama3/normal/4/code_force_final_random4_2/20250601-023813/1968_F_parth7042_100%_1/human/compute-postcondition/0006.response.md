Output State: **t is at least 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is greater than 1, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is an integer and the element at index i is the integer value of data at index, pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is the XOR of the element at index 0 and the element at index 1 in a and the element at index i is the XOR of the element at index i-1 and the element at index i in a, mp is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is the value of pf at index 1 and the value is a list containing at least the element 1 and the element i, index is incremented by 2, data remains unchanged, results remains an empty list, i is 2**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1 as one test case is processed. The value of `n` remains greater than 1 as it is not modified by the code. The value of `q` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `a` now has an additional element at index `i` which is the integer value of `data` at index. The list `pf` now has an additional element at index `i` which is the XOR of the element at index `i-1` and the element at index `i` in `a`. The dictionary `mp` now has an additional key-value pair where the key is the value of `pf` at index `i` and the value is a list containing at least the element `i`. The value of `index` is incremented by 2 as it is incremented by 1 in each of the two lines that modify it. The value of `data` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `results` remains empty as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` remains 2 as it is not modified by the code.
