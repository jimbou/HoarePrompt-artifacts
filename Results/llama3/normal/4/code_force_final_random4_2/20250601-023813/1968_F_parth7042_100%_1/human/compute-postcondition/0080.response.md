Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer equal to the value of data[index], q is an integer equal to the value of data[index + 1], a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is the value of data[index - 1], the element at index 2 is the value of data[index], and all other elements are 0, pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is the XOR of the value of data[index - 1] and 0, the element at index 2 is the XOR of the value of data[index - 1] and the value of data[index], and all other elements are 0, mp is a dictionary with three key-value pairs where the key is 0 and the value is a list containing only 0, the key is the XOR of the value of data[index - 1] and 0 and the value is a list containing only 1, and the key is the XOR of the value of data[index - 1] and the value of data[index] and the value is a list containing only 2, index is incremented by 1, data remains unchanged, i is 2, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q times, v1 is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, v2 is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, it1 is an integer representing the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is an integer representing the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1, l is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 1], r is an integer equal to the value of data[index], x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1].**

The code block modifies the values of `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `index`, and `i`. The value of `a` at index 2 is updated to the value of `data[index]`. The value of `pf` at index 2 is updated to the XOR of the value of `pf` at index 1 and the value of `a` at index 2. The dictionary `mp` is updated with a new key-value pair where the key is the value of `pf` at index 2 and the value is a list containing only 2. The value of `index` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged. All other variables remain unchanged.
