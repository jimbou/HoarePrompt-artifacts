Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer equal to the value of data[index], q is an integer equal to the value of data[index + 1], a is a list of n+1 elements where all elements are 0, pf is a list of n+1 elements where all elements are 0, mp is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is 0 and the value is a list containing only 0, index is incremented by 2, data remains unchanged, i is n, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q times, v1 is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, v2 is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, it1 is an integer representing the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is an integer representing the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1, l is an integer equal to the value of data[index], r is an integer equal to the value of data[index + 1], x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1].**

In this final state, the values of `n` and `q` have been updated to the values of `data[index]` and `data[index + 1]`, respectively. The list `a` and `pf` have been reinitialized with `n+1` elements, all set to 0. The dictionary `mp` has been reinitialized with a single key-value pair where the key is 0 and the value is a list containing only 0. The value of `index` has been incremented by 2. The lists `v1` and `v2` still contain all integers from 0 to `n`. The values of `it1` and `it2` remain unchanged. The values of `l` and `r` are still equal to the values of `data[index]` and `data[index + 1]`, respectively. The value of `x` is still the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`. The list `results` still contains the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end `q` times.
