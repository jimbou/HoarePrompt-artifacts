Output State: **t is at least 2, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, q is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is an integer and the element at index i is an integer, and all other elements are 0, pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is the XOR of the element at index 1 in a and the element at index 0 in pf, the element at index i is the XOR of the element at index i in a and the element at index i-1 in pf, and all other elements are 0, mp is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the XOR of the element at index 1 in pf and the value is a list containing 0, 1, and i, index is incremented by 1, data remains unchanged, i is 3, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q times, a[i] is the integer value of data[index-1], pf[i] is the XOR of pf[i-1] and a[i], and mp[pf[i]] is a list containing 0, 1, i.**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to the integer value of `data[index-1]`, and `pf[i]` has been updated to the XOR of `pf[i-1]` and `a[i]`. The dictionary `mp` now contains a new key-value pair where the key is the XOR of the element at index 1 in `pf` and the value is a list containing 0, 1, and `i`. The `index` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
