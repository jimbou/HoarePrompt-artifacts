Output State: **t is at least 2, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer that must be greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is an integer for all i in range(1, n+1), pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the XOR of the element at index i in a and the element at index i-1 in pf for all i in range(1, n+1), mp is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the XOR of the element at index 1 in pf and the value is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, index is incremented by 2, data remains unchanged, i is n, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q+1 times, _ is 0, l is an integer equal to the value at index in data, r is an integer equal to the value at index + 1 in data, x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] and equals 0**

The code appends 'YES' to the results list, incrementing the number of times 'YES' or 'NO' is appended to the end of the results list by 1. No other variables are affected by the code.
