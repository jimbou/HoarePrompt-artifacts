Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 1, n is an integer equal to the value of data[index], q is an integer equal to the value of data[index + 1], a is a list of n+1 elements where all elements are 0, pf is a list of n+1 elements where all elements are 0, mp is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is 0 and the value is a list containing only 0, index is incremented by 2, data remains unchanged, i is n, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q times, v1 is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, v2 is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, it1 is an integer representing the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is an integer representing the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1, l is an integer equal to the value of data[index], r is an integer equal to the value of data[index + 1], x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1].
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, n is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 1] and must be at least 1, q is an integer equal to the value of data[index], a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is the value of data[index - 1] and all other elements are 0, pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is the XOR of the value of data[index - 1] and 0 and all other elements are 0, mp is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the key is 0 and the value is a list containing only 0, and the key is the XOR of the value of data[index - 1] and 0 and the value is a list containing only 1, index is incremented by 1, data remains unchanged, i is 1, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q times, v1 is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, v2 is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, it1 is an integer representing the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is an integer representing the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1, l is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 1], r is an integer equal to the value of data[index], x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is at least 1, n is an integer equal to the value of data[index], q is an integer equal to the value of data[index + 1], a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is the value of data[index - 1], the element at index 2 is the value of data[index], the element at index 3 is the value of data[index], and all other elements are 0, pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is the XOR of the value of data[index - 1] and 0, the element at index 2 is the XOR of the value of data[index - 1] and the value of data[index], the element at index 3 is the XOR of the value of data[index - 1], the value of data[index], and the value of data[index], and all other elements are 0, mp is a dictionary with four key-value pairs where the key is 0 and the value is a list containing only 0, the key is the XOR of the value of data[index - 1] and 0 and the value is a list containing only 1, the key is the XOR of the value of data[index - 1] and the value of data[index] and the value is a list containing only 2, and the key is the XOR of the value of data[index - 1], the value of data[index], and the value of data[index] and the value is a list containing only 3, index is incremented by 1, data remains unchanged, i is 3, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q times, v1 is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, v2 is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, it1 is an integer representing the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is an integer representing the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1, l is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 1], r is an integer equal to the value of data[index], x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1]




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
