Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 1, n is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 1], q is an integer equal to the value of data[index], a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the value of data[index - 1 + i - 1] for 1 <= i <= n and all other elements are 0, pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the XOR of the value of data[index - 1 + j - 1] for 1 <= j <= i and all other elements are 0, mp is a dictionary with n+1 key-value pairs where the key is the XOR of the value of data[index - 1 + j - 1] for 1 <= j <= i and the value is a list containing only i for 1 <= i <= n, index is incremented by n, data remains unchanged, i is n, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q times, v1 is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, v2 is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, it1 is an integer representing the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is an integer representing the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1, l is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 1], r is an integer equal to the value of data[index], x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1].
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[index])
    r = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp[pf[r]]
    v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
    it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is at least 1, n is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 3], q is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 2] and must be greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the value of data[index - 3 + i - 1] for 1 <= i <= n and all other elements are 0, pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the XOR of the value of data[index - 3 + j - 1] for 1 <= j <= i and all other elements are 0, mp is a dictionary with n+1 key-value pairs where the key is the XOR of the value of data[index - 3 + j - 1] for 1 <= j <= i and the value is a list containing only i for 1 <= i <= n, index is incremented by 2, data remains unchanged, i is n, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q times, v1 is a list containing only the value of i where pf[r] is the XOR of the value of data[index - 3 + j - 1] for 1 <= j <= i, v2 is a list containing only the value of i where pf[l - 1] is the XOR of the value of data[index - 3 + j - 1] for 1 <= j <= i, it1 is an integer representing the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is an integer representing the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1, l is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 2], r is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 1], and if it1 is less than the length of v1 and it2 is greater than or equal to 0 and v1[it1] is less than v2[it2], then 'YES' is appended to results. Otherwise, 'NO' is appended to results.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is at least 1, n is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 5], q is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 4] and must be greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the value of data[index - 5 + i - 1] for 1 <= i <= n and all other elements are 0, pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the XOR of the value of data[index - 5 + j - 1] for 1 <= j <= i and all other elements are 0, mp is a dictionary with n+1 key-value pairs where the key is the XOR of the value of data[index - 5 + j - 1] for 1 <= j <= i and the value is a list containing only i for 1 <= i <= n, index is incremented by 4, data remains unchanged, i is n, v1 is a list containing only the value of i where pf[r] is the XOR of the value of data[index - 5 + j - 1] for 1 <= j <= i, v2 is a list containing only the value of i where pf[l - 1] is the XOR of the value of data[index - 5 + j - 1] for 1 <= j <= i, it1 is an integer representing the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is an integer representing the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1, l is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 2], r is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 1], x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1]. If it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] < v2[it2]), then results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q+1 times. Otherwise, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q times and one more 'NO' than before.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is at least 1, n is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 7], q is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 6] and must be greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the value of data[index - 7 + i - 1] for 1 <= i <= n and all other elements are 0, pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the XOR of the value of data[index - 7 + j - 1] for 1 <= j <= i and all other elements are 0, mp is a dictionary with n+1 key-value pairs where the key is the XOR of the value of data[index - 7 + j - 1] for 1 <= j <= i and the value is a list containing only i for 1 <= i <= n, index is incremented by 6, data remains unchanged, i is n, v1 is a list containing the values of i where pf[r] is the XOR of the value of data[index - 7 + j - 1] for 1 <= j <= i, v2 is a list containing the values of i where pf[l - 1] is the XOR of the value of data[index - 7 + j - 1] for 1 <= j <= i, it1 is an integer representing the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is an integer representing the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1, l is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 2], r is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 1], x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1]. If it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] < v2[it2]), then results is a list containing 'YES'. Otherwise, results is a list containing 'NO'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
