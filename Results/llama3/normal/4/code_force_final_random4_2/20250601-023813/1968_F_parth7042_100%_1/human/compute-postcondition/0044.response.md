To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an integer that must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `i` must be less than `n + 1` for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `q` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of `n+1` elements where the element at index 1 is an integer and the element at index `i` is an integer, and all other elements are 0, `pf` is a list of `n+1` elements where the element at index 1 is the XOR of the element at index 1 in `a` and the element at index 0 in `pf`, the element at index `i` is the XOR of the element at index `i` in `a` and the element at index `i-1` in `pf`, and all other elements are 0, `mp` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the XOR of the element at index 1 in `pf` and the value is a list containing 0, 1, and `i`, `index` is incremented by 2*q + 2, `data` remains unchanged, `i` is 3, `results` is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end `q` times**
