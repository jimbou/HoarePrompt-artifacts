Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 5], q is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 4] and must be greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the value of data[index - 5 + i - 1] for 1 <= i <= n and all other elements are 0, pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the XOR of the value of data[index - 5 + j - 1] for 1 <= j <= i and all other elements are 0, mp is a dictionary with n+1 key-value pairs where the key is the XOR of the value of data[index - 5 + j - 1] for 1 <= j <= i and the value is a list containing only i for 1 <= i <= n, index is incremented by 4, data remains unchanged, i is n, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q+1 times, v1 is a list containing only the value of i where pf[r] is the XOR of the value of data[index - 5 + j - 1] for 1 <= j <= i, v2 is a list containing only the value of i where pf[l - 1] is the XOR of the value of data[index - 5 + j - 1] for 1 <= j <= i, it1 is an integer representing the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is an integer representing the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1, l is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 2], r is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 1], x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1].**

The code appends 'YES' to the results list, increasing the number of 'YES' or 'NO' strings in the list by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
