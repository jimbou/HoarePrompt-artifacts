The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is incremented by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is greater than 1, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is an integer, pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is the XOR of the element at index 0 and the element at index 1 in a, mp is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is the value of pf at index 1 and the value is a list containing at least the element 1, index is incremented by 2, data remains unchanged, results remains an empty list, i is 2**
