The only variable in the loop head is variable q, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable q. If q is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, q is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, q must be decreased by 1.
State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 3], q is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 2] and must be greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the value of data[index - 3 + i - 1] for 1 <= i <= n and all other elements are 0, pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the XOR of the value of data[index - 3 + j - 1] for 1 <= j <= i and all other elements are 0, mp is a dictionary with n+1 key-value pairs where the key is the XOR of the value of data[index - 3 + j - 1] for 1 <= j <= i and the value is a list containing only i for 1 <= i <= n, index is incremented by 2, data remains unchanged, i is n, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q times, v1 is a list containing only the value of i where pf[r] is the XOR of the value of data[index - 3 + j - 1] for 1 <= j <= i, v2 is a list containing only the value of i where pf[l - 1] is the XOR of the value of data[index - 3 + j - 1] for 1 <= j <= i, it1 is an integer representing the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is an integer representing the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1, l is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 2], r is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 1], and if it1 is less than the length of v1 and it2 is greater than or equal to 0 and v1[it1] is less than v2[it2], then 'YES' is appended to results. Otherwise, 'NO' is appended to results.**
