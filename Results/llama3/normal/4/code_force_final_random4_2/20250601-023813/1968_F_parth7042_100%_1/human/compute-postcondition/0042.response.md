To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer greater than 0.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `q` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of `n+1` elements where the element at index 1 is an integer and all other elements are 0, `pf` is a list of `n+1` elements where the element at index 1 is the XOR of the element at index 1 in `a` and the element at index 0 in `pf`, and all other elements are 0, `mp` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the XOR of the element at index 1 in `pf` and the value is a list containing 0 and 1, `index` is incremented by 2*q + 1, `data` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `results` is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end `q` times**
