Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 3], q is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 2] and must be greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the value of data[index - 3 + i - 1] for 1 <= i <= n and all other elements are 0, pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the XOR of the value of data[index - 3 + j - 1] for 1 <= j <= i and all other elements are 0, mp is a dictionary with n+1 key-value pairs where the key is the XOR of the value of data[index - 3 + j - 1] for 1 <= j <= i and the value is a list containing only i for 1 <= i <= n, index is incremented by 2, data remains unchanged, i is n, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q times, v1 is a list containing only the value of i where pf[r] is the XOR of the value of data[index - 3 + j - 1] for 1 <= j <= i, v2 is a list containing only the value of i where pf[l - 1] is the XOR of the value of data[index - 3 + j - 1] for 1 <= j <= i, it1 is an integer representing the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is an integer representing the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1, l is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 2], r is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 1], and if the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0, results has 'YES' appended to its end.**

The code executes the following operations:

1.  `v1 = mp[pf[r]]`: This line assigns to `v1` the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, which is a list containing only the value of `i` where `pf[r]` is the XOR of the value of `data[index - 3 + j - 1]` for `1 <= j <= i`.
2.  `v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]`: This line assigns to `v2` the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, which is a list containing only the value of `i` where `pf[l - 1]` is the XOR of the value of `data[index - 3 + j - 1]` for `1 <= j <= i`.
3.  `it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)`: This line assigns to `it1` the insertion point for `l` in `v1` to maintain sorted order.
4.  `it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`: This line assigns to `it2` the insertion point for `r` in `v2` to maintain sorted order minus 1.

The final state includes all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution, and updates the values of the variables that are modified by the code. The variables `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` are updated based on the values of `pf[r]`, `pf[l - 1]`, `l`, and `r`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
