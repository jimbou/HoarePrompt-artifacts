To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `q`. The loop will execute as long as `q` is greater than 0. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, its value doesn't matter, but we can infer that it will take on the values from 0 to `q-1` during each iteration.

State: **t is at least 2, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer that must be greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is an integer for all i in range(1, n+1), pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the XOR of the element at index i in a and the element at index i-1 in pf for all i in range(1, n+1), mp is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the XOR of the element at index 1 in pf and the value is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, index is incremented by n, data remains unchanged, i is n, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q times, _ is 0**
