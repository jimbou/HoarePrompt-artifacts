Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly solves the problem by using a prefix XOR array and a hashmap to store the indices of each XOR value. It then checks for each query if there exists a pair of indices in the hashmap that can divide the subarray into two parts with the same XOR value. If such a pair exists, it means the subarray can be divided into two parts with the same XOR value, and the program outputs "YES". Otherwise, it outputs "NO".

The program correctly handles all edge cases, including when the subarray has only one element, when the XOR value of the subarray is 0, and when the subarray cannot be divided into two parts with the same XOR value.

The use of a hashmap to store the indices of each XOR value allows the program to efficiently check for the existence of a pair of indices that can divide the subarray into two parts with the same XOR value. The bisect_left function is used to find the first index in the hashmap that is greater than or equal to the left index of the query, and the last index in the hashmap that is less than or equal to the right index of the query. This allows the program to efficiently check for the existence of a pair of indices that can divide the subarray into two parts with the same XOR value.

Overall, the program is correct and efficiently solves the problem.
