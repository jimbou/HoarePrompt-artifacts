Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 1] and must be at least 1, q is an integer equal to the value of data[index], a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is the value of data[index - 1] and all other elements are 0, pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is the XOR of the value of data[index - 1] and 0 and all other elements are 0, mp is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the key is 0 and the value is a list containing only 0, and the key is the XOR of the value of data[index - 1] and 0 and the value is a list containing only 1, index is incremented by 1, data remains unchanged, i is 1, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q times, v1 is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, v2 is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, it1 is an integer representing the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is an integer representing the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1, l is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 1], r is an integer equal to the value of data[index], x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1].**

This output state reflects the changes made by the code snippet. The value of `a[i]` is updated to the value of `data[index]`, and `index` is incremented by 1. The prefix sum `pf[i]` is updated to the XOR of `pf[i - 1]` and `a[i]`, and the dictionary `mp` is updated with a new key-value pair where the key is `pf[i]` and the value is a list containing only `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
