To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable in the loop head, which is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is at least 1, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and q, followed by a list of n integers, followed by q pairs of integers l and r, index is 1, data is a list of strings, results is an empty list**
