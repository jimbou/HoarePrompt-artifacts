Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `q` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n+1` elements where the element at index `i` is the integer value of `data` at index `i`, `pf` is a list of `n+1` elements where the element at index `i` is the XOR of the element at index `i-1` and the element at index `i` in `a`, `mp` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is the value of `pf` at index `i` and the value is a list containing at least the element `i`, `index` is incremented by 2, `data` remains unchanged, `i` is `n`, `l` is the integer value of `data` at index, `r` is the integer value of `data` at index + 1, `x` is the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is a list containing at least the element `l`, `v2` is a list containing at least the element `r - 1`, `it1` is the insertion point of `l` in `v1` to maintain sorted order, `it2` is the insertion point of `r` in `v2` to maintain sorted order minus 1, and `results` is a list that now contains the string 'YES' appended to its end.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables maintain their initial values and properties, and the only change is that the list `results` now has the string 'YES' appended to its end.
