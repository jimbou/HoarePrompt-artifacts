Output State: **t is at least 2, n is an integer that must be greater than 0, q is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is an integer and all other elements are 0, pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is the XOR of the element at index 1 in a and the element at index 0 in pf, and all other elements are 0, mp is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the XOR of the element at index 1 in pf and the value is a list containing 0 and 1, index is incremented by 2*q + 1, data remains unchanged, i is 1, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end q times.**

The code modifies the values of `a`, `pf`, `mp`, and `index`. The value of `a` at index `i` (which is 1) is set to the integer value of `data` at index `index` (which is incremented by 2*q). The value of `pf` at index `i` is set to the XOR of the value of `a` at index `i` and the value of `pf` at index `i-1` (which is 0). The dictionary `mp` is updated with a new key-value pair where the key is the value of `pf` at index `i` and the value is a list containing 0 and 1. The value of `index` is incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `data`, and `results` remain unchanged.
