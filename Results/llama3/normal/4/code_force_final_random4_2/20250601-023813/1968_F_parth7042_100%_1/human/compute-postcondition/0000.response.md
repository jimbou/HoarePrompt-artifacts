Output State: **stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and q, followed by a list of n integers, followed by q pairs of integers l and r. t is an integer, index is 1, data is a list of strings, results is an empty list.**

Explanation:
The first line reads the entire input from stdin and splits it into a list of strings, which is stored in the variable `data`. The second line initializes the variable `index` to 0. The third line converts the first element of `data` to an integer and assigns it to the variable `t`. The fourth line increments the `index` by 1. The fifth line initializes an empty list `results`.

After executing the code, the state of the variables is as follows:
- `t` is an integer, which is the first element of the input.
- `index` is 1, which is the incremented value of the initial index 0.
- `data` is a list of strings, which contains the entire input split into individual elements.
- `results` is an empty list, which is initialized to store the results of the test cases.

Note that the input in stdin is not modified by the code, so it still contains the test cases.
