The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the value of data[index]. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer equal to the value of data[index], `q` is an integer equal to the value of data[index + 1], `a` is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is the value of data[index - 1], the element at index 2 is the value of data[index], and all other elements are 0, `pf` is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index 1 is the XOR of the value of data[index - 1] and 0, the element at index 2 is the XOR of the value of data[index - 1] and the value of data[index], and all other elements are 0, `mp` is a dictionary with three key-value pairs where the key is 0 and the value is a list containing only 0, the key is the XOR of the value of data[index - 1] and 0 and the value is a list containing only 1, and the key is the XOR of the value of data[index - 1] and the value of data[index] and the value is a list containing only 2, `index` is incremented by 1, `data` remains unchanged, `i` is 3, `results` is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' appended to its end `q` times, `v1` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n`, `v2` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n`, `it1` is an integer representing the insertion point for `l` in `v1` to maintain sorted order, `it2` is an integer representing the insertion point for `r` in `v2` to maintain sorted order minus 1, `l` is an integer equal to the value of data[index - 1], `r` is an integer equal to the value of data[index], `x` is the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`**
