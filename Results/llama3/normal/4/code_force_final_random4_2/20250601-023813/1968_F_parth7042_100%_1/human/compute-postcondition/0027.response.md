Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer, q is an integer that must be greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the integer value of data at index i, pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the XOR of the element at index i-1 and the element at index i in a, mp is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is the value of pf at index i and the value is a list containing at least the element i, index is incremented by 2, data remains unchanged, i is n, l is the integer value of data at index index, r is the integer value of data at index index + 1, x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1], v1 is a list containing at least the element l, v2 is a list containing at least the element r - 1, it1 is the insertion point of l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point of r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1, results is a list that now contains the string 'NO' appended to its end.**

In this output state, the code has appended the string 'NO' to the end of the results list. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their previous values and relationships as specified in the initial state.
