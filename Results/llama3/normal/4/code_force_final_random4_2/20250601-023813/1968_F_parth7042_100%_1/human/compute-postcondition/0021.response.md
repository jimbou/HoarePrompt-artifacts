The only variable in the loop head is variable q, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable q. If q is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, q is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, q must be greater than 0, so q is decreased by 1.
State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer, q is an integer that must be greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the integer value of data at index i, pf is a list of n+1 elements where the element at index i is the XOR of the element at index i-1 and the element at index i in a, mp is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is the value of pf at index i and the value is a list containing at least the element i, index is incremented by 2, data remains unchanged, i is n, l is the integer value of data at index i, r is the integer value of data at index i + 1, x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1], v1 is a list containing at least the element l, v2 is a list containing at least the element r - 1, it1 is the insertion point of l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point of r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1. If it1 is less than the length of v1 and it2 is greater than or equal to 0 and v1[it1] is less than v2[it2], then results is a list that now contains the string 'YES' appended to its end. Otherwise, results is a list containing the string 'NO'**
