Output State: **a is a list of integers, where the first two elements are positive integers n and k, and the remaining n elements are distinct positive integers, x is the kth element of list a, i is increased by 1, c is 3 or not 3, ind is a list containing the index i or not, depending on the value of c, and the index i.**

In this output state, the list `a` remains unchanged, with its first two elements being positive integers `n` and `k`, and the remaining `n` elements being distinct positive integers. The value of `x` is still the `k`th element of list `a`. The variable `i` has been increased by 1. The value of `c` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3 or not 3. The list `ind` now contains the index `i` or not, depending on the value of `c`, and also contains the index `i` that was appended in the first line of the code.
