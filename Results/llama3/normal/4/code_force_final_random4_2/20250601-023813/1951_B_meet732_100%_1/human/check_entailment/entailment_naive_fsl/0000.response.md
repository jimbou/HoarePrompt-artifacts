Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of wins the cow can achieve. The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the case when the cow's rating is not the highest among the first `k` cows. In this case, the cow will not win any matches, but the function returns `k - 1` which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input:

```
3
6 1
12 10 14 11 8 3
```

The function `func_1` returns `1`, but the correct answer is `0` because the cow with rating `12` will lose to the cow with rating `14` in the first match.

The correct implementation should keep track of the maximum rating of the cows that the cow with rating `x` can beat, and return the number of matches that the cow can win based on this information.
