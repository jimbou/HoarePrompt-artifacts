The code snippet assigns the value of the kth element of list `a` to `x`, initializes an empty list `ind`, and sets the value of `c` to 0. The first line affects the value of `x`, the second line creates a new empty list `ind`, and the third line assigns the value 0 to `c`. The initial state of `a` remains unchanged, and the values of `n` and `k` are still the first two elements of `a`. 

Output State: **a is a list of integers, where the first two elements are positive integers n and k, and the remaining n elements are distinct positive integers, x is the kth element of list a, ind is an empty list, c is 0**
