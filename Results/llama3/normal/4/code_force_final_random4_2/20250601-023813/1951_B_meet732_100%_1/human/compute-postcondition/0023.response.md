Postcondition: **a is a list of integers, where the first two elements are positive integers n and k, and the remaining n elements are distinct positive integers, x is the kth element of list a. The list ind contains the indices of elements in a that are greater than x. The current value of c is the number of elements in a that are greater than x, but not more than 2. The list ind is not empty and contains exactly one element. The index of the first element in a that is greater than x is 0.**
