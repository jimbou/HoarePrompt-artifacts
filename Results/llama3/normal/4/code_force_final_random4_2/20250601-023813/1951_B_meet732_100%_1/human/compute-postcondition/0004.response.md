Postcondition: **a is a list of integers, where the first two elements are positive integers n and k, and the remaining n elements are distinct positive integers, x is the kth element of list a, if the value of a[i] is greater than the value of x, then ind is a list containing the index i, c is 1, and i is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to ind, c, and i.**
