Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of integers, where the first two elements are positive integers n and k, and the remaining n elements are distinct positive integers, x is the kth element of list a, ind is an empty list, c is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] > x:
        ind.append(i)
        c += 1
    if c == 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is a list of integers, where the first two elements are positive integers n and k, and the remaining n elements are distinct positive integers, x is the kth element of list a. If c is 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and if the value of a[i] is greater than the value of x, then ind is a list containing the index i. If c is not 2, then no changes are made to ind, c, and i.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *a is a list of integers, where the first two elements are positive integers n and k, and the remaining n elements are distinct positive integers, x is the kth element of list a. If c is 2, then if the current element at index i is greater than x, then i is increased by 1, c is 3 or not 3, and ind is a list containing the index i or not, depending on the value of c, and the index i. Otherwise, no changes are made and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If c is not 2, then no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a list of integers, where the first two elements are positive integers `n` and `k`, and the remaining `n` elements are distinct positive integers, `x` is the `k`th element of list `a`. If `c` is 2 and an element in the list `a` is larger than `x`, then `c` is 3 or not 3, and `ind` is a list containing the index `i+1` or not, depending on the value of `c`, the index `i+1`, and the index `i`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c` is not 2, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
