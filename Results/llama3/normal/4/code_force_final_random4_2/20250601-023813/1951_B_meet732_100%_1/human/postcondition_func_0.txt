This function takes a list of integers as input, where the first two elements are positive integers n and k, and the remaining n elements are distinct positive integers. It returns the maximum possible value that can be obtained by considering the indices of elements in the list that are greater than the kth element. The function considers different cases based on the number of elements greater than the kth element and their indices, and returns the maximum value accordingly. The function does not modify the input list.
