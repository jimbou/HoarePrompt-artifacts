Output State: **a is a list of integers, where the first two elements are positive integers n and k, and the remaining n elements are distinct positive integers, x is the kth element of list a. If the current element at index i is greater than x, then i is increased by 1, c is 3 or not 3, and ind is a list containing the index i or not, depending on the value of c, and the index i. Otherwise, no changes are made and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables a, n, k, x, i, c, and ind remain the same as before, with the only change being that we have exited the loop or if statement.
