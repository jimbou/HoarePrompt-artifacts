Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, where the first two elements are positive integers `n` and `k`, and the remaining `n` elements are distinct positive integers, `x` is the `k`th element of list `a`. If `c` is 2 and an element in the list `a` is larger than `x`, then `c` is 3 or not 3, and `ind` is a list containing the index `i+1` or not, depending on the value of `c`, the index `i+1`, and the index `i`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c` is not 2, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
