The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, `n` is some value greater than `i`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` remains the same.
State: **a is a list of integers, where the first two elements are positive integers n and k, and the remaining n elements are distinct positive integers, x is the kth element of list a, c is 2 or not 2, and ind is a list containing the index i+1 or not, depending on the value of c, and the index i+1**
