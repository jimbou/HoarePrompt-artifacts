Postcondition: ***a is a list of integers, where the first two elements are positive integers n and k, and the remaining n elements are distinct positive integers, x is the kth element of list a. If an element in the list a is larger than x, then c is 3 or not 3, and ind is a list containing the index i+1 or not, depending on the value of c, the index i+1, and the index i. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
