You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

The list ind is not empty and contains exactly one element. The index of the first element in ind is not equal to 0

Case_3: The program returns the minimum value between the second index in the list 'ind' minus 1 and 'k' minus 1. The second index in the list 'ind' is greater than 0, and 'k' is a positive integer and the second element of list 'a'.

Case_4: The program returns the maximum value between the difference of the first element of list ind and 1, and the difference between the second element of list ind and the first element of list ind. The first element of list ind is not 0 and is greater than 0, and the second element of list ind is greater than the first element of list ind. The list ind contains more than one element and contains the indices of elements in list a that are greater than x, where x is the kth element of list a.
