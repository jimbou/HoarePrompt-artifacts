Output State: **a is a list of integers, where the first two elements are positive integers n and k, and the remaining n elements are distinct positive integers, x is the kth element of list a, c is 3 or not 3, and ind is a list containing the index i+1 or not, depending on the value of c, the index i+1, and the index i.**

The code modifies the values of `c` and `ind`. The first line appends the index `i` to the list `ind`, adding a new element to the list. The second line increments the value of `c` by 1. Since `c` was initially 2 or not 2, it becomes 3 or not 3, respectively. The values of `a`, `x`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
