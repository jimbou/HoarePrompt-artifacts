The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value less than `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **a is a list of integers, where the first two elements are positive integers n and k, and the remaining n elements are distinct positive integers, x is the kth element of list a, i is increased by 1, c is 2 or not 2, ind is a list containing the index i or not, depending on the value of c**
