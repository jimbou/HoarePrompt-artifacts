Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between the difference of the first index of elements greater than x and 1, and the difference of k and the first index of elements greater than x.**

In this output state, the first index of elements greater than x is ind[0], which is greater than 0 because the first element of ind is not 0. The value of k is less than or equal to ind[1], which means k is also less than or equal to the second index of elements greater than x. The program returns the maximum value between the difference of these two indices and 1, and the difference of k and the first index of elements greater than x.
