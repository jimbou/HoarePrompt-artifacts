Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the favorite cube has a value that is not unique among the cubes. In this case, the program only checks if the favorite cube is among the first k cubes after sorting, but it does not consider the possibility that there are other cubes with the same value that may be removed instead.

For example, if the input is:

5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3

The program will output "MAYBE", but the correct output should be "YES" because the favorite cube (with value 3) will always be removed, regardless of its position after sorting.

The program needs to be modified to correctly handle cases where the favorite cube has a non-unique value.
