Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, f, and k (1 <= f, k <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 100).**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 1000. The rest of the input remains unchanged, with `t` test cases still to be processed. Each test case still consists of two lines, with the first line containing three integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and the second line containing `n` integers `a_i`.
