Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `f` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `k` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `favorite_value` is an integer between 1 and 100, `sorted_a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 2, `removed_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a` if `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`, otherwise `removed_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k-1` elements of `sorted_a` plus one, `favorite_count` is equal to the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`.***
