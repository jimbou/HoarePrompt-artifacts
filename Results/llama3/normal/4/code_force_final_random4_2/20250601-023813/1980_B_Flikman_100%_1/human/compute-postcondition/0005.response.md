Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `f` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `favorite_value` is an integer between 1 and 100, `sorted_a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `removed_count` is 1, `i` is 0. The current value of `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`**

In this output state, the value of `removed_count` has been incremented by 1, resulting in a value of 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and conditions.
