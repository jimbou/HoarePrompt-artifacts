The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `f` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `k` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `favorite_value` is an integer between 1 and 100, `sorted_a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 2, `removed_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a` if `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`, otherwise `removed_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k-1` elements of `sorted_a`, `favorite_count` is equal to the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`.**
