Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `f` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `k` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `favorite_value` is an integer between 1 and 100, `sorted_a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 2. If the current value of `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is 4. Otherwise, `removed_count` is 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `removed_count` is incremented by 1. If the current value of `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` becomes 4. Otherwise, `removed_count` becomes 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
