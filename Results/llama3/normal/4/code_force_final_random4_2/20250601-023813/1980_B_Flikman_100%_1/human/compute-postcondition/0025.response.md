Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100, f is an integer between 1 and n, k is an integer between 1 and n, a is a list of n integers, favorite_value is an integer between 1 and 100, sorted_a is a list of n integers sorted in descending order, i is k-1. If no elements have been removed from sorted_a yet, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if all occurrences of favorite_value have been removed from sorted_a, 'MAYBE' is printed.***
