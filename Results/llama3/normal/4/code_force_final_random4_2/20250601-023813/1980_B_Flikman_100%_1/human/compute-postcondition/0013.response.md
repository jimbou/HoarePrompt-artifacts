Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100, f is an integer between 1 and n, k is an integer between 1 and n, a is a list of n integers, favorite_value is an integer between 1 and 100, sorted_a is a list of n integers sorted in descending order, i is k-1. If the current value of sorted_a[i] is equal to favorite_value, then removed_count is equal to the number of times favorite_value appears in the first k elements of sorted_a. Otherwise, removed_count is equal to the number of times favorite_value appears in the first k-1 elements of sorted_a.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for t, stdin, n, f, a, favorite_value, and sorted_a as in the initial state. The value of i will be k-1, and the value of removed_count will be equal to the number of times favorite_value appears in the first k elements of sorted_a.
