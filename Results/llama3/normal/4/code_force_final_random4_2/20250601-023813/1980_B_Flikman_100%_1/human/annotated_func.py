#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, f, and k (1 <= f, k <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 100).
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        favorite_value = a[f - 1]
        
        sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)
        
        removed_count = 0
        
        for i in range(k):
            if sorted_a[i] == favorite_value:
                removed_count += 1
        
        favorite_count = sorted_a.count(favorite_value)
        
        if removed_count == favorite_count:
            print('YES')
        elif removed_count == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('MAYBE')
        
    #State: t is 0, stdin contains 0 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100, f is an integer between 1 and n, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of n integers, favorite_value is an integer between 1 and 100, sorted_a is a list of n integers sorted in descending order, i is k, removed_count is equal to the total number of times favorite_value appears in the first k elements of sorted_a, and favorite_count is equal to the total number of times favorite_value appears in sorted_a which is equal to sorted_a.count(favorite_value). If the number of times favorite_value appears in the first k elements of sorted_a is equal to the total number of times favorite_value appears in sorted_a, 'YES' is printed. If the number of times favorite_value appears in the first k elements of sorted_a is 0, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'MAYBE' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' for each case based on the occurrence of a favorite value in a sorted list of integers. It takes no parameters and returns no values, but instead prints the results directly. The function's purpose is to determine whether a favorite value appears in the top k elements of a sorted list, and it performs this action for multiple test cases provided in the input.
