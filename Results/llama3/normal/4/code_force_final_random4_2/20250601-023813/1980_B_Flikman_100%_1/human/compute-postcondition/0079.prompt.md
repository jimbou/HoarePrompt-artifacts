Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, f, and k (1 <= f, k <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 100).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    favorite_value = a[f - 1]
    sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)
    removed_count = 0
    for i in range(k):
        if sorted_a[i] == favorite_value:
            removed_count += 1
    favorite_count = sorted_a.count(favorite_value)
    if removed_count == favorite_count:
        print('YES')
    elif removed_count == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100, f is an integer between 1 and n, k is an integer between 1 and n, a is a list of n integers, favorite_value is an integer between 1 and 100, sorted_a is a list of n integers sorted in descending order, i is k-1, removed_count is equal to the number of times favorite_value appears in the first k elements of sorted_a if the current value of sorted_a[i] is equal to favorite_value, otherwise removed_count is equal to the number of times favorite_value appears in the first k-1 elements of sorted_a, favorite_count is equal to the total number of times favorite_value appears in sorted_a. If the number of times favorite_value has been removed is equal to the total number of times favorite_value appears in sorted_a, 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, if no elements have been removed from sorted_a yet, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if all occurrences of favorite_value have been removed from sorted_a, 'MAYBE' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `f` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `favorite_value` is an integer between 1 and 100, `sorted_a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `k-1`, `removed_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`, `favorite_count` is equal to the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a` which is equal to `sorted_a.count(favorite_value)`. If `removed_count` equals `favorite_count`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if `removed_count` is 0, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'MAYBE' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 0 and 998, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100, f is an integer between 1 and n, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of n integers, favorite_value is an integer between 1 and 100, sorted_a is a list of n integers sorted in descending order, i is k, removed_count is equal to the total number of times favorite_value appears in the first k elements of sorted_a, and favorite_count is equal to the total number of times favorite_value appears in sorted_a which is equal to sorted_a.count(favorite_value). If the number of times favorite_value appears in the first k elements of sorted_a is equal to the total number of times favorite_value appears in sorted_a, 'YES' is printed. If the number of times favorite_value appears in the first k elements of sorted_a is 0, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'MAYBE' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
