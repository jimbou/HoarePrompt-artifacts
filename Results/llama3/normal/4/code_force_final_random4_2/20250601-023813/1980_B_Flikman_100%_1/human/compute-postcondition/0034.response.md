Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `f` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `k` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `favorite_value` is an integer between 1 and 100, `sorted_a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 1, `removed_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a` plus one if `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`, otherwise `removed_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k-1` elements of `sorted_a` plus one, `favorite_count` is equal to the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the `removed_count` variable has been incremented by 1. This means that the number of times the `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a` (if `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`) or the first `k-1` elements of `sorted_a` (otherwise) has increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
