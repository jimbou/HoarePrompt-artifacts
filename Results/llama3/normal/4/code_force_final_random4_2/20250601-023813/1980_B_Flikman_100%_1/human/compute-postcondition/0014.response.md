Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100, f is an integer between 1 and n, k is an integer between 1 and n, a is a list of n integers, favorite_value is an integer between 1 and 100, sorted_a is a list of n integers sorted in descending order, i is k-1, removed_count is equal to the number of times favorite_value appears in the first k elements of sorted_a if the current value of sorted_a[i] is equal to favorite_value, otherwise removed_count is equal to the number of times favorite_value appears in the first k-1 elements of sorted_a, favorite_count is equal to the total number of times favorite_value appears in sorted_a.**

In this output state, the value of `favorite_count` is updated to be equal to the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
