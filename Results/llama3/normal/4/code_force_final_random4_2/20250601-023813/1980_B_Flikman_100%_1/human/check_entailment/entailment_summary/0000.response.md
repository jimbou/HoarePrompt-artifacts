Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. It correctly reads the input, processes the test cases, and prints the results. The program's logic is sound, and it accurately determines whether the favorite cube will be removed in all cases, not removed in any case, or may be either removed or left.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of cubes, the index of the favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes. It then reads the values shown on the cubes. The program sorts the values in non-increasing order and counts the occurrences of the favorite value in the top k elements. Based on this count, it prints 'YES' if the favorite cube will be removed in all cases, 'NO' if it will not be removed in any case, or 'MAYBE' if it may be either removed or left.

The execution summary provided confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing multiple test cases and printing the correct results.

Correctness: **True**
