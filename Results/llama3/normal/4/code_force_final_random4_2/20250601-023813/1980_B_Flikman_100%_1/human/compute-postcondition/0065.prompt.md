Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 0 and 998, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100, f is an integer between 1 and n, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of n integers, favorite_value is an integer between 1 and 100, sorted_a is a list of n integers sorted in descending order, i is k-1, removed_count is 0, favorite_count is equal to the total number of times favorite_value appears in sorted_a which is equal to sorted_a.count(favorite_value)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if sorted_a[i] == favorite_value:
        removed_count += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 998, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `f` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `favorite_value` is an integer between 1 and 100, `sorted_a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 0, and `favorite_count` is equal to the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a` which is equal to `sorted_a.count(favorite_value)`. If the first element of `sorted_a` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is 1, otherwise `removed_count` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 998, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `f` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `k` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `favorite_value` is an integer between 1 and 100, `sorted_a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 1, `favorite_count` is equal to the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a` which is equal to `sorted_a.count(favorite_value)`. If the first element of `sorted_a` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is 2, otherwise `removed_count` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 998, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `f` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `k` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `favorite_value` is an integer between 1 and 100, `sorted_a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 2, `favorite_count` is equal to the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a` which is equal to `sorted_a.count(favorite_value)`, and `removed_count` is either 3 if the first element of `sorted_a` is equal to `favorite_value` and the third element of `sorted_a` is also equal to `favorite_value`, otherwise it is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
