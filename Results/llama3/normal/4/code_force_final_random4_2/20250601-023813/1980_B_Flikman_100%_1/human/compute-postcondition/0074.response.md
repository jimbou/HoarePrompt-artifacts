Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 0 and 998, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100, f is an integer between 1 and n, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of n integers, favorite_value is an integer between 1 and 100, sorted_a is a list of n integers sorted in descending order, i is k, removed_count is equal to the total number of times favorite_value appears in the first k elements of sorted_a, and favorite_count is equal to the total number of times favorite_value appears in sorted_a which is equal to sorted_a.count(favorite_value). The number of times favorite_value appears in the first k elements of sorted_a is greater than 0***
