The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers `n`, `f`, and `k` (1 <= `f`, `k` <= `n` <= 100). The second line contains `n` integers `a_i` (1 <= `a_i` <= 100). So for the loop to be executed  `t` must be greater than 0 and `_` is 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers `n`, `f`, and `k` (1 <= `f`, `k` <= `n` <= 100). The second line contains `n` integers `a_i` (1 <= `a_i` <= 100), `_` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0**
