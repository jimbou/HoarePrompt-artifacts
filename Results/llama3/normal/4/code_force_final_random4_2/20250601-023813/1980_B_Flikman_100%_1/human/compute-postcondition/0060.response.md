Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 998, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `f` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `k` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `favorite_value` is an integer between 1 and 100, `sorted_a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 1, `favorite_count` is equal to the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a` which is equal to `sorted_a.count(favorite_value)`, and `removed_count` is either 2 if the first element of `sorted_a` is equal to `favorite_value`, otherwise `removed_count` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `removed_count` has been incremented by 1. If the first element of `sorted_a` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is now 2, otherwise it is 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
