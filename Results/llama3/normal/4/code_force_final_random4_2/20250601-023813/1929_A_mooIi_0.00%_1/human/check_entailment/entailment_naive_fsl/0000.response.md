Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem description. The program sorts the array in ascending order and prints the sorted array, but it does not calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

For example, if the input is:

3
2 1 3

The program will output:

1 2 3

But the correct output should be:

2

Because the maximum beauty of the array is (3 - 2) + (2 - 1) = 2.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the maximum beauty of the array, and therefore it is incorrect.
