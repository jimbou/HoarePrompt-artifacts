Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of elements in the list) and then a list of integers. The integer is a positive integer and greater or equal to 2. The integers in the list are positive integers and less or equal to 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
    print(' '.join(ar))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer, ar is a map object containing a sorted list of strings representing integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a positive integer and a space-separated list of integers, and the sorted list of strings representing integers in the map object ar is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is a positive integer equal to the input value, ar is a map object containing a sorted list of strings representing integers, stdin is empty, and a string of space-separated integers is printed, where the integers are the sorted values from the map object ar

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, ar is a map object containing a sorted list of strings representing integers, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, and the sorted list of strings representing integers is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
