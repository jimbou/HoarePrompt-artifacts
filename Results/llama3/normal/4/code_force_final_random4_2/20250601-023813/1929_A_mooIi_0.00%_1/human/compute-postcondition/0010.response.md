Based on the precondition, we know that `ar` is a map object containing a sorted list of strings representing integers. The `print` statement is trying to join the elements of `ar` into a single string using spaces as separators.

Since `ar` is a map object, it doesn't have a defined order, and the `join` method will not work as expected. However, assuming that the `ar` map object has been sorted in some way (perhaps using the `sorted` function), we can proceed with the analysis.

The `join` method will concatenate the elements of `ar` into a single string, using spaces as separators. Since the elements of `ar` are strings representing integers, the resulting string will be a space-separated list of integers.

Therefore, the output will be a string containing the sorted list of integers from the `ar` map object, separated by spaces.

Output: **a space-separated list of integers from the ar map object, in sorted order**
