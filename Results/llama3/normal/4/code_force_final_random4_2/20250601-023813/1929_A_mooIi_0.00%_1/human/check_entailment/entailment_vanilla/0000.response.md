Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. However, the program is not correctly implementing the solution.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements. It then sorts the array in ascending order and prints the sorted array.

However, the problem requires finding the maximum beauty of the array, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. The program is not calculating this sum.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after sorting the array. This can be done by iterating over the sorted array and adding the difference between each element and its previous element to the sum.

Here is the correct implementation:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        beauty = sum(ar[i] - ar[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

Correctness: **False**
