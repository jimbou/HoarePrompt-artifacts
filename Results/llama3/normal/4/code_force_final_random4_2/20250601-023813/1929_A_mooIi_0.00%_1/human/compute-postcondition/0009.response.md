Output State: **n is an integer, ar is a map object containing a sorted list of strings representing integers, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers**.

In this final state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer value of the input, replacing its previous value as a positive integer greater than the previous input value. The `ar` map object now contains a sorted list of strings representing integers, which are the result of sorting the list of integers from the input in ascending order and converting them back to strings. The `stdin` is now empty, as both lines of the code have consumed the input values.
