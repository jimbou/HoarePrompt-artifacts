Output State: **n is an integer, ar is a map object containing a sorted list of strings representing integers, stdin is empty, and a string of space-separated integers is printed, where the integers are the sorted values from the map object ar.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable 'n' will hold an integer value, the variable 'ar' will hold a map object containing a sorted list of strings representing integers, the standard input (stdin) will be empty, and a string of space-separated integers will be printed. The integers in the printed string will be the sorted values from the map object 'ar'.
