Reasoning: 

The given Python program is incorrect. The problem requires the program to calculate the maximum beauty of the array, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. However, the program is currently printing the sorted array itself, not the sum of the differences.

The correct program should calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array and print that value. The current program is missing this calculation step.

Correctness: **False**
