To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved in the loop head are the loop variable `_` and the `range` object created from the input value.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value
* `ar` is a map object containing a sorted list of strings representing integers
* `stdin` is empty
* A string of space-separated integers is printed, where the integers are the sorted values from the map object `ar`

To execute the loop again, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head. Since the loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body, we can ignore it.

The `range` object is created from the input value, which is stored in `n`. For the loop to execute again, the input value must be greater than the current value of `n`. Therefore, we need to increment `n` by 1.

The state of `ar` and `stdin` remains unchanged, as they are not involved in the loop head.

The final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than the previous input value, `ar` is a map object containing a sorted list of strings representing integers, `stdin` is empty**

Note that we don't need to specify the exact value of `n`, as it's sufficient to know that it's greater than the previous input value.
