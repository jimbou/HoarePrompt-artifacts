This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer (n) and a list of positive integers. It sorts the list of integers in ascending order, converts them to strings, and prints the sorted list as a string of space-separated integers. The function repeats this process until all test cases have been read from standard input, leaving the input stream empty.
