Reasoning:

The given Python program is intended to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. However, the program does not actually calculate the beauty of the array. Instead, it sorts the array in ascending order and prints the sorted array as a string of space-separated integers.

The problem statement requires the program to output the maximum beauty of the array, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. The program does not perform this calculation.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not solve the problem as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
