Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect because it does not calculate the maximum beauty of the array as required by the problem description. Instead, it simply sorts the array in ascending order and prints the sorted array as a string of space-separated integers.

The problem description requires the program to calculate the maximum beauty of the array, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the array. The program does not perform this calculation and instead focuses on sorting the array.

To fix this, the program should calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array and print this sum as the maximum beauty of the array.

Correctness: **False**
