To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions that must be met for the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is the loop variable `_`, which is not explicitly used in the loop body. However, the loop condition depends on the `input()` function, which reads from the standard input `stdin`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a positive integer and a space-separated list of integers. For the loop to execute again, `stdin` must contain at least one more test case, which means it must contain at least one more positive integer and a space-separated list of integers.

The state of `n` is not relevant to the loop condition, as it is not used in the loop head. The state of `ar` is also not relevant, as it is not used in the loop head.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the state of `stdin`, which must contain at least one more test case.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ar` is a map object containing a sorted list of strings representing integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: a positive integer and a space-separated list of integers**
