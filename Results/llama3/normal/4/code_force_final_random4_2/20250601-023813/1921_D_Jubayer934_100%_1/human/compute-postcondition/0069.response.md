Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements in `a` and `b` up to the point where the loop broke (if it broke), or all elements in `a` and `b` if the loop did not break, `temp` is either -1 (if the loop did not break) or the index `i` where the loop broke (if it broke).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

- The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop.
- The value of `m` also remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop.
- The list `a` remains a sorted list of `n` integers, unchanged by the loop.
- The list `b` remains a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, unchanged by the loop.
- The variable `i` will be equal to `n` after the loop finishes all its iterations, as it increments from 0 to `n-1` and then the loop ends.
- The list `ans` will contain the absolute differences between corresponding elements in `a` and `b`. If the loop broke at some point (because the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` was met), `ans` will contain these differences up to that breaking point. If the loop did not break (meaning the condition was never met), `ans` will contain all the absolute differences between corresponding elements in `a` and `b`.
- The variable `temp` will either remain -1 (if the loop did not break, meaning the condition was never met for any `i`) or will be set to the index `i` where the loop broke (if the condition was met at some point).
