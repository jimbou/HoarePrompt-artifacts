Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `temp` is -1, `ans` is an empty list, `a` is a sorted list of n integers, `b` is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 0. The current value of `i` is 0. The absolute difference between the current element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` (from the end) is greater than the absolute difference between the current element of `a` and the current element of `b`.***
