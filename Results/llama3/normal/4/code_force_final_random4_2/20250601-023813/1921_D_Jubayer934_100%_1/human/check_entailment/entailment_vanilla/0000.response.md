Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by rearranging the array c_i of length n to be as different as possible from Petya's array a_i.

The given program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the values of n and m, and the arrays a_i and b_i. It sorts the arrays a_i and b_i in ascending and descending order respectively.

The program then iterates over the sorted arrays and calculates the absolute difference between the corresponding elements of the two arrays. If the absolute difference between the current element of a_i and the last element of b_i is greater than the absolute difference between the current element of a_i and the current element of b_i, it updates the variable temp to the current index and breaks the loop.

If temp is not -1, it means that the program found a pair of elements where the absolute difference between the current element of a_i and the last element of b_i is greater than the absolute difference between the current element of a_i and the current element of b_i. In this case, the program appends the absolute differences between the remaining elements of a_i and the corresponding elements of b_i (starting from the last element) to the list ans.

Finally, the program prints the sum of the absolute differences in the list ans, which represents the maximum total difference D that can be obtained.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference D, and it handles the edge cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
