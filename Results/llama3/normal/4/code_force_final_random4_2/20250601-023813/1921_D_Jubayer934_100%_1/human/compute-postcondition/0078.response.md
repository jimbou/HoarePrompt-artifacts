Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements in `a` and `b`, if the loop did not break, then `ans` contains all elements in `a` and `b`, otherwise the last `n - temp` elements of `ans` are the absolute differences between `a[temp]` and `b[-(n - temp)]`, `a[temp + 1]` and `b[-(n - temp - 1)]`, ..., `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]`, and `temp` is either -1 (if the loop did not break) or the index `i` where the loop broke (if it broke)***
