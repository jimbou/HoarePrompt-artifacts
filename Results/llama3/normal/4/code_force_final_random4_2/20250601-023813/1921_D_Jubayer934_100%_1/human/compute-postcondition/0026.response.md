The code prints the sum of the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of the sorted lists `a` and `b`, and the absolute differences between `a[temp]` and `b[-(n - temp)]` for `temp` in range(temp, n). Where `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `temp` is an integer between 0 and `n-1` inclusive, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, and `i` is equal to `n-1`.
Output: **n is an integer, m is an integer, temp is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive, ans is a list containing the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of a and b. If temp is not equal to -1, then ans also contains the absolute differences between a[temp] and b[-(n - temp)] for temp in range(temp, n), a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, stdin contains no input, and i is equal to n-1, and the sum of the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of a and b, and the absolute differences between a[temp] and b[-(n - temp)] for temp in range(temp, n) is printed**
