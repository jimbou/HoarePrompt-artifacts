Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the corresponding elements of `b`, stdin contains no input. The current value of `temp` is not -1, indicating that there exists an element in `a` whose absolute difference with the last element of `b` is greater than its absolute difference with the corresponding element of `b`.***
