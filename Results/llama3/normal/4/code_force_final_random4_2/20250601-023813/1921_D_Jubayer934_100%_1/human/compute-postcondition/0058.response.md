Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer equal to the second input, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, i is 0, ans is an empty list, temp is 0.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the current value of `i` to `temp`, making `temp` equal to 0. The second line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables. 

Since `i` is 0, `temp` becomes 0. No other variables are affected by the code. The state of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `ans` remains unchanged.
