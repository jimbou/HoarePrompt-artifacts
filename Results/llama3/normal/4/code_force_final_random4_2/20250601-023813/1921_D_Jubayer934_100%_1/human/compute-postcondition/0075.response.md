The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, temp and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `temp + 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `temp` is less than `n` and `temp` is increased by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` is `temp + 3` and `temp` is increased by 1 and `n` is greater than `temp + 3`. 
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is `temp + 3`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements in `a` and `b` up to the point where the loop broke (if it broke), or all elements in `a` and `b` if the loop did not break, and the last element of `ans` is the absolute difference between `a[temp + 3]` and `b[-(n - temp - 3)]`, `temp` is less than `n` and `temp` is increased by 1**
