Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the corresponding elements of `b`. If the absolute difference between any element of `a` and the last element of `b` is greater than the absolute difference between that element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b`, then `temp` is the index of that element of `a` and `temp` is less than `n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains unchanged.***
