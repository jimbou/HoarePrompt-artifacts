The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`, and the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the second element of `b`, `i` is 3, stdin contains no input. If the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` (from the end) is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`, then `temp` is set to 0. Otherwise, `temp` is set to 1.**
