Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, stdin contains no input, i is 0. If the absolute difference between the current element of a and the corresponding element of b (from the end) is greater than the absolute difference between the current element of a and the current element of b, then temp is set to 0. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
