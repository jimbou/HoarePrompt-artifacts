Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `n` integers `a_i` and `m` integers `b_i`.
2.  It sorts the arrays `a` and `b` in ascending and descending order, respectively, which is necessary to find the maximum total difference `D`.
3.  The program then iterates over the sorted arrays `a` and `b` and calculates the absolute difference between corresponding elements. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, it updates the `temp` variable to `i` and breaks the loop.
4.  After the loop, if `temp` is not `-1`, it means that a better arrangement of elements in `b` was found to maximize the total difference `D`. In this case, the program appends the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` to the `ans` list for the remaining elements.
5.  Finally, the program prints the sum of the absolute differences in the `ans` list, which represents the maximum total difference `D` that can be obtained.

Correctness: **True**
