Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is greater than or equal to `temp + 2`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the corresponding elements of `b` including the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` and the newly added absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`, `temp` is less than `n`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `temp` remain the same as in the initial state. The list `ans` has been updated to include the absolute difference between the elements of `a` and the corresponding elements of `b` including the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` and the newly added absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`.
