Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, m is an integer equal to the second input, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, i is 2, ans is a list containing the absolute difference between a[0] and b[0] and the absolute difference between a[1] and b[1], temp is 2.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `temp = i` and `break`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `temp`, making `temp` equal to 2. The second line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
