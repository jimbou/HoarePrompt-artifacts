Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is `temp + 2`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements in `a` and `b` up to the point where the loop broke (if it broke), or all elements in `a` and `b` if the loop did not break, and the last element of `ans` is the absolute difference between `a[temp + 2]` and `b[-(n - temp - 2)]`, `temp` is less than `n` and `temp` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` is increased by 1, and the list `ans` has been appended with the absolute difference between the `i-th` element of `a` and the `(n-i)-th` element of `b` (from the end). The value of `temp` is also increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
