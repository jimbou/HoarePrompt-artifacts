Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`, stdin contains no input. If the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `b` is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`, then `temp` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition regarding `temp` is still applicable, but its value is not changed by the given code snippet.
