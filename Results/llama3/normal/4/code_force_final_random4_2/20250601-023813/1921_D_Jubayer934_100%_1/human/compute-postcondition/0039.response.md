Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, m is an integer equal to the second input, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, i is 2, ans is a list containing the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, the absolute difference between the second element of a and the second element of b, and the absolute difference between the third element of a and the second element of b, temp is 2.**

The code snippet does not modify the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, or `ans`. The variable `i` remains unchanged as well. The only change occurs in the variable `temp`, which is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2.
