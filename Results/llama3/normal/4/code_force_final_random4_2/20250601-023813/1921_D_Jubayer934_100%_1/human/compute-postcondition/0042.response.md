Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the corresponding elements of `b`, stdin contains no input. If the absolute difference between any element of `a` and the last element of `b` is greater than the absolute difference between that element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b`, then `temp` is the index of that element of `a`. Otherwise, `temp` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is the number of elements in the sorted list `a`. After each iteration, the absolute difference between the current element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` is appended to the list `ans`. If the absolute difference between any element of `a` and the last element of `b` is greater than the absolute difference between that element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b`, the index of that element of `a` is stored in the variable `temp`. Otherwise, `temp` remains unchanged. After the loop finishes executing, `i` will be equal to `n`, and `ans` will contain the absolute differences between all elements of `a` and the corresponding elements of `b`. The state of the other variables, including `m`, `a`, `b`, and stdin, remains unchanged.
