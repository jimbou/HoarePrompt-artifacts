According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of n integers, `b` is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, `i` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is -1, `input` is empty**
