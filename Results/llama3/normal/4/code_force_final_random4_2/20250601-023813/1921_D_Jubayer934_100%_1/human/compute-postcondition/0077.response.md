Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements in `a` and `b`, and the last `n - temp` elements of `ans` are the absolute differences between `a[temp]` and `b[-(n - temp)]`, `a[temp + 1]` and `b[-(n - temp - 1)]`, ..., `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]`, `temp` is equal to `n`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the loop has iterated over the entire range from `temp` to `n`, and the list `ans` now contains the absolute differences between corresponding elements in `a` and `b` for all indices from `temp` to `n-1`. The value of `i` has reached `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The value of `temp` has also reached `n`, indicating that the loop has iterated over the entire range.
