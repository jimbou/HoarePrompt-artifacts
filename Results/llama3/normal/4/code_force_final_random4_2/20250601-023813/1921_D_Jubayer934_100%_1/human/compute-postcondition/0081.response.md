Output State: **The loop has executed for all the test cases in the input. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `ans`, and `temp` have been updated according to the last test case. The sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the corresponding elements of `b` has been printed for each test case. The input has been fully consumed.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has finished executing for all the test cases provided in the input. The variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `ans`, and `temp` now hold the values from the last test case. The sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the corresponding elements of `b` has been printed for each test case. The input has been fully consumed, meaning that there is no more input left to process.
