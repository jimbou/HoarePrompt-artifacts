State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is `temp + 1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements in `a` and `b` up to the point where the loop broke (if it broke), or all elements in `a` and `b` if the loop did not break, and the last element of `ans` is the absolute difference between `a[temp + 1]` and `b[-(n - temp - 1)]`, `temp` is less than `n`**
