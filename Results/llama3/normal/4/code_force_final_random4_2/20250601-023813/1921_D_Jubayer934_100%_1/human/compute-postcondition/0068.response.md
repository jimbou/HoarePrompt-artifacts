Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `b[1]`, and the absolute difference between `a[2]` and `b[2]`. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `temp` is set to 2. Otherwise, no changes are made to `temp`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the absolute difference between `a[2]` and `b[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `temp` is still dependent on the comparison of the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` and `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
