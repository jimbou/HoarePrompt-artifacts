Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy to maximize the total difference D between the two arrays. The program first sorts both arrays and then iterates through the first array. For each element in the first array, it calculates the absolute difference with the corresponding element in the second array and the absolute difference with the mirrored element from the end of the second array. If the latter is greater, it switches to the mirrored pairing strategy for the remaining elements. This approach ensures that the total difference D is maximized.

Correctness: **True**
