Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The third line contains m integers b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    temp = -1
    ans = []
    a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]
    b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]
    for i in range(n):
        if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
            temp = i
            break
        ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))
    if temp != -1:
        for i in range(temp, n):
            ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))
    print(sum(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, m is an integer, temp is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive, ans is a list containing the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of a and b. If temp is not equal to -1, then ans also contains the absolute differences between a[temp] and b[-(n - temp)] for temp in range(temp, n), a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, stdin contains no input, and i is equal to n-1, and the sum of the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of a and b, and the absolute differences between a[temp] and b[-(n - temp)] for temp in range(temp, n) is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the corresponding elements of `b`. If the absolute difference between any element of `a` and the last element of `b` is greater than the absolute difference between that element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b`, then `temp` is the index of that element of `a` and `temp` is less than `n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains unchanged, and the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the corresponding elements of `b` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements in `a` and `b`, if the loop did not break, then `ans` contains all elements in `a` and `b`, otherwise the last `n - temp` elements of `ans` are the absolute differences between `a[temp]` and `b[-(n - temp)]`, `a[temp + 1]` and `b[-(n - temp - 1)]`, ..., `a[n - 1]` and `b[0]`, and `temp` is either -1 (if the loop did not break) or the index `i` where the loop broke (if it broke), and the sum of the absolute differences is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
