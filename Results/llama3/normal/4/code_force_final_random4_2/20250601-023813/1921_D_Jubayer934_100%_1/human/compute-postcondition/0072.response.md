Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is `temp`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements in `a` and `b` up to the point where the loop broke (if it broke), or all elements in `a` and `b` if the loop did not break, and the last element of `ans` is the absolute difference between `a[temp]` and `b[-(n - temp)]`, `temp` is less than `n`**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by appending the absolute difference between the elements at index `temp` in `a` and the element at index `-(n - temp)` in `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
