Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the corresponding elements of `b`, `temp` is less than `n`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `i` has reached `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The list `ans` now contains the absolute differences between all elements of `a` and the corresponding elements of `b`. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop. The value of `temp` is still less than `n`, but its exact value is not specified.
