The only variable in the loop head is `i`, `temp`, and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `temp` and `n`. If `temp` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements in `a` and `b` up to the point where the loop broke (if it broke), or all elements in `a` and `b` if the loop did not break. The current value of `temp` is not -1, indicating that the loop broke at some index `i`. So for the loop to be executed  `temp` must be less than `n` and `i` is now `temp`.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is `temp`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements in `a` and `b` up to the point where the loop broke (if it broke), or all elements in `a` and `b` if the loop did not break, `temp` is less than `n`**
