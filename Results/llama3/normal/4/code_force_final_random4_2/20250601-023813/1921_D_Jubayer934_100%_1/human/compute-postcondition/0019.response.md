State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `temp` is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive and less than n, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of `a` and `b` and the absolute difference between `a[temp]` and `b[-(n - temp)]`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is equal to `temp + 1`**
