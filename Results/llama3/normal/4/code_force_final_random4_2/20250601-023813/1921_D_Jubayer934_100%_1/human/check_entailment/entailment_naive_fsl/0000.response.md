Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by arranging the array c_i of length n to be as different as possible from Petya's array a_i.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first reads the number of test cases t.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of integers n and m, and the arrays a_i and b_i.
3. It sorts the arrays a_i and b_i in ascending and descending order, respectively.
4. It initializes an empty list ans to store the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of a_i and b_i.
5. It iterates over the range of n, and for each i, it checks if the absolute difference between a_i[i] and b_i[-(n-i)] is greater than the absolute difference between a_i[i] and b_i[i]. If it is, it sets a flag temp to i and breaks the loop.
6. If temp is not -1, it means that the optimal arrangement is to pair the smallest elements of a_i with the largest elements of b_i, and vice versa. It appends the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of a_i and b_i to the list ans.
7. Finally, it prints the sum of the absolute differences in the list ans, which represents the maximum total difference D that can be obtained.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where n = m or where all elements of a_i and b_i are equal. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
