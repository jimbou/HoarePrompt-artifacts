Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, temp is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive, ans is a list containing the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of a and b, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, stdin contains no input.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `n` remains an integer, `m` remains an integer, `a` remains a sorted list of `n` integers, and `b` remains a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order. The variable `temp` is set to an integer between 0 and `n-1` inclusive, which is the index `i` where the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n-i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, or -1 if no such index is found. The variable `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the first `min(n, m)` elements of `a` and `b`. The input stream `stdin` remains empty.
