The code prints the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding elements in `a` and `b`. If the loop did not break, then the sum is the sum of the absolute differences between all elements in `a` and `b`. Otherwise, the sum is the sum of the absolute differences between the last `n - temp` elements of `a` and the first `n - temp` elements of `b` in reverse order.

Output: **sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements in a and b**
