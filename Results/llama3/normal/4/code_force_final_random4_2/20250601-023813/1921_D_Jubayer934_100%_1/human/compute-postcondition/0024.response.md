Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, temp is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive, ans is a list containing the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of a and b. If temp is not equal to -1, then ans also contains the absolute differences between a[temp] and b[-(n - temp)] for temp in range(temp, n), a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, stdin contains no input, and i is equal to n-1.***
