Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, temp is -1, ans is an empty list, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, stdin contains no input, and i is not defined.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
        temp = i
        break
    ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`, stdin contains no input. If the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `b` is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`, then `temp` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b` and the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the second element of `b`. If the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `b` is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`, then `temp` is 1. Otherwise, `temp` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`, the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the second element of `b`, the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and the second element of `b`, and the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and the third element of `b`. If the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and the last element of `b` is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and the third element of `b`, then `temp` is 2. Otherwise, `temp` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
