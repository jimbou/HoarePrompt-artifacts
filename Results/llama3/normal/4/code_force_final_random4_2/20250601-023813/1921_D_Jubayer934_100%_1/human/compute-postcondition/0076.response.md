Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is `temp + 4`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements in `a` and `b` up to the point where the loop broke (if it broke), or all elements in `a` and `b` if the loop did not break, and the last two elements of `ans` are the absolute differences between `a[temp + 3]` and `b[-(n - temp - 3)]`, and `a[temp + 4]` and `b[-(n - temp - 4)]`, `temp` is less than `n` and `temp` is increased by 1**.

In this output state, the value of `i` has been increased by 1, and a new absolute difference between `a[temp + 4]` and `b[-(n - temp - 4)]` has been appended to the list `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.
