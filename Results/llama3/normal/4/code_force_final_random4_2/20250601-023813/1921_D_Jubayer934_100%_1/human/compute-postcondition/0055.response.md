Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer equal to the second input, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, i is not defined, ans is an empty list, temp is -1, input is empty**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` are updated based on the input values. The lists `a` and `b` are populated with sorted integers from the input, with `a` being sorted in ascending order and `b` being sorted in descending order. The variable `i` is no longer defined, as it was not updated or used in the code. The list `ans` is initialized as an empty list, and the variable `temp` is set to -1. The input is now empty, as all input values have been consumed by the code.
