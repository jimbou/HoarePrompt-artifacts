The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and the input. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the input is greater than or equal to 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the input must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the corresponding elements of `b`, `temp` is less than `n`, input is greater than 1**
