To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `temp`, and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than or equal to `temp + 1`, and `temp` is less than `n`. To execute the loop again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `i` is greater than or equal to `temp + 2`
* `temp` remains less than `n`
* `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 0

The other variables, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `ans`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is greater than or equal to `temp + 2`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the corresponding elements of `b` including the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`, `temp` is less than `n`**
