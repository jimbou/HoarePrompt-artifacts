Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer equal to the second input, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, stdin contains no input, i is 0. If the absolute difference between the i-th element of a and the (n-i)-th element of b is greater than the absolute difference between the i-th element of a and the i-th element of b, then temp is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made. ans is an empty list.***
