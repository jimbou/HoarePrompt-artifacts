The `print(sum(ans))` statement will print the sum of all elements in the `ans` list.

The `ans` list contains the absolute differences between the first `min(n, m)` elements of lists `a` and `b`, as well as the absolute differences between `a[temp]` and `b[-(n - temp)]` for `temp` in the range from `temp` to `n`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, and `temp` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `sum(ans)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the sum of the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b`, as described above.

Output: **sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists a and b**
