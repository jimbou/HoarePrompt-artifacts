Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, m is an integer equal to the second input, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, i is 1, ans is a list containing the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, temp is 1.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged because the provided code snippet does not modify these variables. The only change occurs in the variable `temp`, which is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The `break` statement does not affect the state of any variables.
