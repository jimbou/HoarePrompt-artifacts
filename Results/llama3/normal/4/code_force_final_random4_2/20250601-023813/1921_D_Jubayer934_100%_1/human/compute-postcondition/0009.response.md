Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, ans is a list containing the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, i is 1, stdin contains no input. If the absolute difference between the first element of a and the corresponding element of b (from the end) is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, then temp is set to 0. Otherwise, temp is set to 1.***
