Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the corresponding elements of `b`, stdin contains no input. The current value of `temp` is not -1, indicating that there exists an element in `a` whose absolute difference with the last element of `b` is greater than its absolute difference with the corresponding element of `b`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(temp, n):
    ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is greater than or equal to `temp`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the corresponding elements of `b`, `temp` is less than `n`, and `ans` has been appended with the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is greater than or equal to `temp + 1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the corresponding elements of `b` including the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`, `temp` is less than `n`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is greater than or equal to `temp + 2`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the corresponding elements of `b` including the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` and the newly added absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`, `temp` is less than `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
