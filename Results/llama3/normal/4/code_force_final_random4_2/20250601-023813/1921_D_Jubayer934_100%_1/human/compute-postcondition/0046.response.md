To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `temp`, and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than or equal to `temp`, and `temp` is less than `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now greater than or equal to `temp + 1`.
* `temp` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.
* `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables, such as `m`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, are not modified in the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is greater than or equal to `temp + 1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the corresponding elements of `b`, `temp` is less than `n`**
