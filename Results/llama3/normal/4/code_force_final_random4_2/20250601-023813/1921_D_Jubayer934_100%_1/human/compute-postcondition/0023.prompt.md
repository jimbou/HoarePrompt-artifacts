Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *n is an integer, m is an integer, temp is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive, ans is a list containing the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of a and b, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, stdin contains no input. The current value of temp is not -1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(temp, n):
    ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `temp` is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive and less than n, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of `a` and `b` and the absolute difference between `a[temp]` and `b[-(n - temp)]`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is equal to `temp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `temp` is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive and less than n, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of `a` and `b`, the absolute difference between `a[temp]` and `b[-(n - temp)]`, and the absolute difference between `a[temp + 1]` and `b[-(n - (temp + 1))]`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is equal to `temp + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `temp` is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive and less than n, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of `a` and `b`, the absolute difference between `a[temp]` and `b[-(n - temp)]`, the absolute difference between `a[temp + 1]` and `b[-(n - (temp + 1))]`, the absolute difference between `a[temp + 2]` and `b[-(n - (temp + 2))]`, and the absolute difference between `a[temp + 3]` and `b[-(n - (temp + 3))]`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is equal to `temp + 3




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
