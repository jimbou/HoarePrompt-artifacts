Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer equal to the second input, temp is 0, ans is an empty list, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, stdin contains no input, i is 0. The absolute difference between the i-th element of a and the (n-i)-th element of b is greater than the absolute difference between the i-th element of a and the i-th element of b.**

In this output state, the only change from the initial state is that the value of `temp` has been updated to 0, which is the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
