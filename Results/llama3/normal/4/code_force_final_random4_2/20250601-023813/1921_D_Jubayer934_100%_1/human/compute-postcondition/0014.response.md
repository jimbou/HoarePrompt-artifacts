Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`, the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the second element of `b`, and the absolute difference between the fourth element of `a` and the fourth element of `b`, `i` is 3, stdin contains no input. If the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` (from the end) is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and the third element of `b`, then `temp` is set to 0. Otherwise, `temp` is set to 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the absolute difference between the fourth element of `a` and the fourth element of `b`, since `i` is 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
