The code prints the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of list `a` and the corresponding elements of list `b`. Here, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, and `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order. The absolute differences are calculated and stored in the list `ans`. The sum of these absolute differences is then printed.

Output: **sum of absolute differences between elements of a and corresponding elements of b**
