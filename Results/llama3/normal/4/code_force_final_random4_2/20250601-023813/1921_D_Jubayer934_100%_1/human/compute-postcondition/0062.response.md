Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, m is an integer equal to the second input, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, i is 1, ans is a list containing the absolute difference between a[0] and b[0], temp is 1.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `temp`, making `temp` equal to 1. The second line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables. Therefore, the only change made by the code is assigning the value of `i` to `temp`. All other variables remain unchanged.
