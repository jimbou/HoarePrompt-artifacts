Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `n` integers and `m` integers.
2.  It sorts the two sets of integers, `a` and `b`, in ascending and descending order, respectively. This is necessary for the pairing strategy used in the program.
3.  The program then iterates over the sorted sets of integers. For each pair of integers, it calculates the absolute difference and adds it to the `ans` list.
4.  The program uses a mirrored pairing strategy if the absolute difference between an element in the first set and the corresponding element in the second set is greater than the absolute difference between the element in the first set and the element in the second set that is mirrored from the end. This is done to maximize the sum of the absolute differences.
5.  Finally, the program prints the sum of the absolute differences for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
