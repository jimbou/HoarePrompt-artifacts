Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `temp` is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive and less than n, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of `a` and `b`, the absolute difference between `a[temp]` and `b[-(n - temp)]`, the absolute difference between `a[temp + 1]` and `b[-(n - (temp + 1))]`, the absolute difference between `a[temp + 2]` and `b[-(n - (temp + 2))]`, and the absolute difference between `a[temp + 3]` and `b[-(n - (temp + 3))]`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is equal to `temp + 3**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `ans` now contains an additional element, which is the absolute difference between the elements at index `temp + 3` in list `a` and the element at index `n - (temp + 3)` in list `b`. The value of `i` has also been updated to `temp + 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
