Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is greater than or equal to `temp`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the corresponding elements of `b`, `temp` is less than `n`, and `ans` has been appended with the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, `m` is still equal to the second input, `a` and `b` are still sorted lists of integers, `i` is still greater than or equal to `temp`, and `temp` is still less than `n`. The list `ans` has been updated by appending the absolute difference between the `i-th` element of `a` and the `i-th` element from the end of `b`.
