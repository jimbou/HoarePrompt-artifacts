Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`, the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the second element of `b`, the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and the second element of `b`, and the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and the third element of `b`. If the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and the last element of `b` is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and the third element of `b`, then `temp` is 2. Otherwise, `temp` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 2, and `m` is still equal to the second input. The lists `a` and `b` remain sorted in ascending and descending order, respectively. The value of `i` is still 2. The list `ans` now contains four elements: the absolute differences between the first, second, and third elements of `a` and the first, second, and third elements of `b`, respectively. The value of `temp` is still 2 if the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and the last element of `b` is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and the third element of `b`, otherwise it remains unchanged.
