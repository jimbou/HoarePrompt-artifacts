Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, temp is -1, ans is an empty list, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, stdin contains no input, and i is not defined.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The code executes and assigns the first input to `n` and the second input to `m`. The value of `temp` is set to -1. The list `ans` is initialized as an empty list. The list `a` is created by sorting the first `n` integers from the input and `b` is created by sorting the first `m` integers from the input in descending order. The standard input `stdin` is empty after the code execution. The variable `i` is not defined in the output state.
