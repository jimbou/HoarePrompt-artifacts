Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b` and the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the second element of `b`. If the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `b` is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`, then `temp` is 1. Otherwise, `temp` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the second element of `b`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
