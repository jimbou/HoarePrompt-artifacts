Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`. If the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[-n]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, then `temp` is set to 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `temp`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the absolute difference between the first elements of lists `a` and `b`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the condition regarding `temp` is still applicable based on the values of `a[0]`, `b[0]`, and `b[-n]`.
