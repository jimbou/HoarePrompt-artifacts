Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`. If the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `b` is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`, then `temp` is 1. Otherwise, `temp` remains unchanged.***
