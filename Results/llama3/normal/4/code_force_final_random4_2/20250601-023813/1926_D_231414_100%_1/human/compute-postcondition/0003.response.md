According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `data`. If `data` has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, times is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer, dic is an empty dictionary, ans is 0, check is 2147483647, _ is 0, stdin contains (times - 2) test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the i is the first integer in the list.
State: **`times` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `data` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `check` is 2147483647, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains (times - 2) test cases, `i` is the first integer in the list**
