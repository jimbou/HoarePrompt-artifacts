Postcondition: ***`times` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `data` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `dic` is a dictionary that contains the integer `i` with a value of 0, `ans` is 0, `check` is 2147483647, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains (times - 2) test cases, `i` is the first integer in the list and is also a key in `dic` with a value of 0, `s` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `i` and `check`.***
