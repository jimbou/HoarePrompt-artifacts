stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), representing the total number of integers. The second line of each test case contains n non-negative integers a_1, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j < 2^31), separated by spaces.
