Output State: **`times` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `data` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `check` is 2147483647, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains (times - 2) test cases, `i` is the first integer in the list, `s` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `i` and `check`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` is calculated by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the first integer `i` in the list `data` and the value of `check`, which is 2147483647. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
