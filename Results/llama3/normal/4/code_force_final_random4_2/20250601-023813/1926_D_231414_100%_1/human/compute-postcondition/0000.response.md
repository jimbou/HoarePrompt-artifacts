Output State: **times is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), check is 2147483647, stdin contains multiple lines of input with (times - 1) test cases.**

The first line of the code assigns the integer value of the first line of stdin to the variable `times`. Since the initial state specifies that the first line of stdin contains an integer `t` between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `times` will take on this value. The second line of the code assigns the value of 2^31 - 1 to the variable `check`. This value is a constant and does not depend on any previous values or inputs. 

After executing the code, `times` will hold the value of the first line of stdin, and `check` will hold the value 2147483647. The remaining lines of stdin, which contain the test cases, are not affected by the code and will still be present in stdin. Since one line of stdin has been consumed by the `input()` function, the number of test cases remaining in stdin will be `times - 1`.
