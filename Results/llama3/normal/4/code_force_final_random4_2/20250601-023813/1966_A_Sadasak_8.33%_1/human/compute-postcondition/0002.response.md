The code `frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1` updates the `frequency_table` dictionary by incrementing the count of the key `num` by 1. If `num` is not already a key in the dictionary, it is added with a count of 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer and 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the key is the first integer in the list `arr` and the value is 1, `num` is the first integer in the list `arr`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `arr` remains unchanged, the integer `k` remains unchanged, the dictionary `frequency_table` now contains the first integer in the list `arr` as a key with a count of 1, and the variable `num` still holds the value of the first integer in the list `arr`.
