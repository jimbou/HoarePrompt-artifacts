Functionality: This function takes a list of integers and an integer k as input, and returns a dictionary where the keys are the integers from the list and the values are their frequencies, but capped at k. In other words, if an integer appears more than k times in the list, its frequency in the returned dictionary will be k; otherwise, its frequency will be its actual count in the list.
