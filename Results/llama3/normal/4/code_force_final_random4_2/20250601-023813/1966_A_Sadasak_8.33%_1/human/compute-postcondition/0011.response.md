Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `k` is an integer and 2 <= k <= 100, `num` is the third integer in the list `arr`, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the key is the second integer in the list `arr` and the value is `k` if the original value of `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`. Otherwise, the value of `frequency_table` is `frequency_table[num] + 1**

In this output state, the value of `frequency_table[num]` has been updated based on its original value and the value of `k`. If the original value of `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k`, then its value is now `k`. Otherwise, its value has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
