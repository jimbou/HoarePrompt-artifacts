To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for num in arr:`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list has at least 3 integers, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in the list `arr`.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `arr` must have at least 3 integers, and `num` must be the third integer in the list `arr`.

The other variables, `k` and `frequency_table`, are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `k` is an integer and 2 <= k <= 100, `num` is the third integer in the list `arr`, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the key is the second integer in the list `arr` and the value is `k` if the original value of `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`. Otherwise, the value of `frequency_table` is `frequency_table[num] + 1**
