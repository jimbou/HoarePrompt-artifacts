According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. If the list has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is an integer and 2 <= k <= 100 and `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the num is the first integer in the list.
State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer and 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary, num is the first integer in the list**
