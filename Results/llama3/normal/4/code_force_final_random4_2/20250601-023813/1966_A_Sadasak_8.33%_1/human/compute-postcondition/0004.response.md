Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer and 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the key is the first integer in the list `arr` and the value is `k`, `num` is the first integer in the list `arr` and the current value of `frequency_table[num]` is `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `arr` still contains at least one integer. The value of `k` remains an integer between 2 and 100. The dictionary `frequency_table` now has the first integer in the list `arr` as its key, and its value is updated to `k`. The variable `num` still holds the first integer in the list `arr`, and the current value of `frequency_table[num]` is now `k`.
