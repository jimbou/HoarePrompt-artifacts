Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `k` is an integer and 2 <= k <= 100, `num` is the second integer in the list `arr`. `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the key is the second integer in the list `arr` and the value is `k` if the original value of `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`. Otherwise, the value of `frequency_table` is `frequency_table[num] + 1`***
