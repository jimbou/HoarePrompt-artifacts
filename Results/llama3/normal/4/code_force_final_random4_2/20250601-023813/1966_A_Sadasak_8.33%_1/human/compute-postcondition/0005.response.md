Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer and 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the key is the first integer in the list `arr` and the value is `k` if the original value of `frequency_table[num]` is larger than `k`. Otherwise, the value of `frequency_table` remains unchanged, `num` is the first integer in the list `arr`.***
