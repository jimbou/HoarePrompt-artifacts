Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer and 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the keys are all the integers in the list `arr` and the values are `k` if the original value of `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`. Otherwise, the value of `frequency_table` is the frequency of the integer in the list `arr`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `arr` and the value is the frequency of that integer in the list, capped at `k`. This means that if an integer appears more than `k` times in the list, its frequency in the dictionary will be `k`, otherwise, its frequency will be the actual number of times it appears in the list.
