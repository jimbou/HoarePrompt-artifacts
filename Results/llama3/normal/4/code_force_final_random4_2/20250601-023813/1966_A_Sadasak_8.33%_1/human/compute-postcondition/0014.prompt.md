Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer and 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary
Code of the loop:
for num in arr:
    frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    if frequency_table[num] > k:
        frequency_table[num] = k


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer and 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the key is the first integer in the list `arr` and the value is `k` if the original value of `frequency_table[num]` is larger than `k`. Otherwise, the value of `frequency_table` remains unchanged, `num` is the first integer in the list `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `k` is an integer and 2 <= k <= 100, `num` is the second integer in the list `arr`. `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the key is the second integer in the list `arr` and the value is `k` if the original value of `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`. Otherwise, the value of `frequency_table` is `frequency_table[num] + 1`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `k` is an integer and 2 <= k <= 100, `num` is the third integer in the list `arr`. `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the key is the second integer in the list `arr` and the value is `k` if the original value of `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`. Otherwise, the value of `frequency_table` is `frequency_table[num] + 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
