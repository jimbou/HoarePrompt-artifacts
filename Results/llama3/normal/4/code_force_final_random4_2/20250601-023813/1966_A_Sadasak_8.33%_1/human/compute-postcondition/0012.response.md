Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `k` is an integer and 2 <= k <= 100, `num` is the third integer in the list `arr`, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the key is the second integer in the list `arr` and the value is `k`**.

In this output state, the value of `frequency_table[num]` has been updated to `k`, regardless of its original value. The other variables, `arr`, `k`, and `num`, remain unchanged. The condition that `arr` must have at least 3 integers and `k` is between 2 and 100 (inclusive) still holds. The dictionary `frequency_table` now has the key-value pair where the key is the second integer in the list `arr` and the value is `k`.
