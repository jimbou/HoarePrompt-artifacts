According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer and 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the key is the first integer in the list `arr` and the value is `k` if the original value of `frequency_table[num]` is larger than `k`. Otherwise, the value of `frequency_table` remains unchanged, `num` is the first integer in the list `arr`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the `num` is the second integer in the list.
State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `k` is an integer and 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the key is the second integer in the list `arr` and the value is `k` if the original value of `frequency_table[num]` is larger than `k`. Otherwise, the value of `frequency_table` remains unchanged, `num` is the second integer in the list `arr`.**
