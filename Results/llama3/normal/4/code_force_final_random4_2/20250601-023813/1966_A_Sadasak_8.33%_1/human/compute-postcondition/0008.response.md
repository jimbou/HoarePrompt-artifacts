Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `k` is an integer and 2 <= k <= 100, `num` is the second integer in the list `arr`, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the key is the second integer in the list `arr` and the value is `k`.**

In this output state, the value of `frequency_table[num]` has been updated to `k`, regardless of its original value. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` still has at least 2 integers, `k` is still an integer between 2 and 100, and `num` is still the second integer in the list `arr`. The dictionary `frequency_table` now has the key `num` with the value `k`.
