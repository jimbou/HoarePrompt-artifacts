Output State: **_ is 1, t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), r is the minimum of w and b + x, w, a, b, c, and d are integers assigned from the input, x is the absolute difference between a and c divided by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code executes two lines that modify the values of `l` and `r`. The first line assigns the maximum value between 1 and `b - x` to `l`. Since `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, and `b` is an integer assigned from the input, the value of `l` becomes the maximum of 1 and `b` minus half the absolute difference between `a` and `c`. The second line assigns the minimum value between `w` and `b + x` to `r`. This makes `r` equal to the minimum of `w` and `b` plus half the absolute difference between `a` and `c`. No other variables are affected by the code.
