Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, a, b, c, and d are integers, x is an integer between 0 and (c-a)/2 inclusive, a is less than or equal to c, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the absolute difference between a and c is an odd number, either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between l and b, and the absolute difference between r and b are both less than or equal to x + 1. If the absolute difference between a and c is an even number, either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between l and d is less than or equal to x and the absolute difference between r and d is less than or equal to x.***
