Output: **_ is 1, t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), r is the minimum of w and b + x, w, a, b, c, and d are integers assigned from the input, x is the absolute difference between a and c divided by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: 'Draw' if the absolute difference between l and d is less than or equal to x and the absolute difference between r and d is less than or equal to x, otherwise 'Bob'**
