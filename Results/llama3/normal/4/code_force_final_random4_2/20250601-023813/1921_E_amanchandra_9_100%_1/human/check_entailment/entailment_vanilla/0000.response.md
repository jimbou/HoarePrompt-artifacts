Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the outcome of a game played on a checkered board by two players, Alice and Bob. The game's rules and constraints are provided in the problem description.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1.  The program first reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the board (`r` and `w`) and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`).
3.  The program then checks if Alice's chip is initially above Bob's chip (`a > c`). If so, it immediately prints "Draw" because Alice cannot win in this scenario.
4.  If Alice's chip is not above Bob's chip, the program calculates the number of rows (`x`) that Alice needs to move to reach Bob's row. It uses the formula `x = abs(a - c) // 2` to calculate this value.
5.  The program then checks if the difference between Alice's and Bob's rows is odd (`abs(a - c) % 2`). If it is, Alice will move diagonally, and the program calculates the possible columns (`l` and `r`) that Bob's chip can be in to win.
6.  If the difference is odd, the program checks if Bob's chip is within the calculated columns (`l` and `r`) and if the distance between Bob's chip and the possible winning columns is within Alice's moving range (`x + 1`). If both conditions are met, it prints "Alice"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".
7.  If the difference between Alice's and Bob's rows is even (`abs(a - c) % 2 == 0`), Alice will move horizontally, and the program calculates the possible columns (`l` and `r`) that Bob's chip can be in to win.
8.  If the difference is even, the program checks if Bob's chip is within the calculated columns (`l` and `r`) and if the distance between Bob's chip and the possible winning columns is within Bob's moving range (`x`). If both conditions are met, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".

After analyzing the program's logic and the problem description, it appears that the program correctly implements the game's rules and constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
