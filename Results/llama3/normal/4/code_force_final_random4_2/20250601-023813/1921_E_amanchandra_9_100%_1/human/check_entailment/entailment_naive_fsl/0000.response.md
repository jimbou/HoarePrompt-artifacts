Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when Alice and Bob are in the same column, but Alice is not in the last row and Bob is not in the first row. In this case, the program will incorrectly print "Draw" instead of "Alice" or "Bob".

For example, if the input is:

10 10 5 5 8 5

The program will print "Draw", but the correct output should be "Alice" because Alice can move down and capture Bob's chip.

The issue is in the line `if a > c: print('Draw')`, which incorrectly assumes that if Alice is above Bob, the game is a draw. However, this is not always the case, as shown in the example above.
