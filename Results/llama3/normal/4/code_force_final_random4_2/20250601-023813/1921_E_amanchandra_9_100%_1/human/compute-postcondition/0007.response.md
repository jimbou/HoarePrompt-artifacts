Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers, `x` is an integer between 0 and (c-a)/2 inclusive, `a` is less than or equal to `c`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `x` is calculated as the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, which results in an integer between 0 and `(c-a)/2` inclusive. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the condition `a` is less than or equal to `c` is still valid. Additionally, the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one.
