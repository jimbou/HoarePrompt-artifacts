The code prints either 'Draw' or 'Bob' based on the conditions `abs(l - d) <= x` and `abs(r - d) <= x`. 

Here, `l` is not defined in the initial state, so we can't determine its value. However, we can describe the value of `r`, `x`, and `d` using the given information.

The value of `r` is the minimum of `w` and `b + x`. The value of `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2. The value of `d` is an integer assigned from the input.

So, the code prints either 'Draw' or 'Bob' based on the conditions `abs(l - d) <= x` and `abs(r - d) <= x`, where `r` is the minimum of `w` and `b + x`, `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, and `d` is an integer assigned from the input.

Output: **Either 'Draw' or 'Bob' (where 'Draw' is printed if abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x, and 'Bob' is printed otherwise)**
