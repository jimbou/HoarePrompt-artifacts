Output State: **_ is 2, t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), r is the minimum of w and d + x, w, a, b, c, and d are integers assigned from the input, x is the integer part of the absolute difference between a and c divided by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, l is the maximum of 1 and d - x.**

In this output state, the values of `_`, `t`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The value of `r` is updated to be the minimum of `w` and `d + x`, and the value of `l` is updated to be the maximum of 1 and `d - x`. The state of `stdin` remains the same as it was not affected by the code.
