The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that the first line of stdin contains a single integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) â€” the number of test cases.

Since `t` is assigned the value of the first integer from stdin, the value of `t` is now known to be between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin now contains multiple test cases, but the first line has been consumed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases**
