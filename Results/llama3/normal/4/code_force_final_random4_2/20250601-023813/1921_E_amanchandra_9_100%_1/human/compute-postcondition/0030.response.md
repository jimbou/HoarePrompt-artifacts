Postcondition: ***_ is 1, t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), r, w, a, b, c, and d are integers assigned from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If a > c, 'Draw' is printed. Otherwise, x is the absolute difference between a and c divided by 2. If the absolute difference between a and c is odd, r is the minimum of w and d + x, and either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between l and b is less than or equal to x + 1 and the absolute difference between r and b is less than or equal to x + 1. If the absolute difference between a and c is even, r is the minimum of w and b + x, and 'Draw' is printed if the absolute difference between l and d is less than or equal to x and the absolute difference between r and d is less than or equal to x, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.***
