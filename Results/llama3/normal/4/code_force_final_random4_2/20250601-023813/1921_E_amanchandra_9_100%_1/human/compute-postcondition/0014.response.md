To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the condition and the values involved.

The print statement uses a list comprehension with a conditional expression to decide which string to print. The condition is:

`abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x`

This condition checks if the absolute differences between `l` and `d`, and between `r` and `d`, are both less than or equal to `x`.

Given the initial state:

- `l` is at least 1
- `r` is at most `w`
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), but `t` is not used in the condition
- `_` is 0, but `_` is not used in the condition
- `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers
- `x` is an integer between 0 and `(c-a)/2` inclusive
- The absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even

Since the exact values of `l`, `r`, `d`, and `x` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical result of the condition. However, we can describe the output based on the condition.

If the condition `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x` is true, the print statement will output `'Draw'`. Otherwise, it will output `'Bob'`.

Therefore, the output depends on whether the absolute differences between `l` and `d`, and between `r` and `d`, are both less than or equal to `x`.

Output: **'Draw' if the condition is true, 'Bob' otherwise**
