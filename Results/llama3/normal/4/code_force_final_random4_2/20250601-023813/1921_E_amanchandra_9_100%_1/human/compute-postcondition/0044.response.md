Output State: **_ is t, t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (exclusive), r, w, a, b, c, and d are integers assigned from the input, stdin contains no test cases.**

This output state means that the loop has executed all the iterations, and the loop counter `_` has reached the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` have been assigned values from the input for the last test case. The standard input `stdin` is empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
