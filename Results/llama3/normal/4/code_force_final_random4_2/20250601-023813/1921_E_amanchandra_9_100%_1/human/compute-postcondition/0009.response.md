Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, a is an integer, b is an integer, c is an integer, d is an integer, x is an integer between 0 and (c-a)/2 inclusive, a is less than or equal to c, the absolute difference between a and c is an odd number, l is an integer equal to the maximum of 1 and d - x, r is an integer equal to the minimum of w and d + x, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this final state, the values of `t`, `_`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `l` is set to the maximum of 1 and `d - x`, and the value of `r` is set to the minimum of `w` and `d + x`. The relationship between `a` and `c` remains the same, with `a` being less than or equal to `c` and their absolute difference being an odd number. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one.
