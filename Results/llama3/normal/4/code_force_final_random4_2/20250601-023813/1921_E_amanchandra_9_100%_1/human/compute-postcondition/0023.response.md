Output State: **_ is 1, t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), r is the minimum of w and d + x, w, a, b, c, and d are integers assigned from the input, x is the absolute difference between a and c divided by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `r` and `l` based on the values of `d`, `x`, and `w`. The first line assigns the maximum value between 1 and `d - x` to `l`. The second line assigns the minimum value between `w` and `d + x` to `r`. The values of `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `x` is also unchanged as it is not reassigned. The value of `_` remains 1, and the value of `t` remains an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive). The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one.
