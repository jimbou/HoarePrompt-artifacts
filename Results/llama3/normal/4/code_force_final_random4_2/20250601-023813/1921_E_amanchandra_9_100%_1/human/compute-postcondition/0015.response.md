Output: **l is at least 1, r is at most w, t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, a, b, c, and d are integers, x is an integer between 0 and (c-a)/2 inclusive, the absolute difference between a and c is even, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between l and d is less than or equal to x and the absolute difference between r and d is less than or equal to x.**
