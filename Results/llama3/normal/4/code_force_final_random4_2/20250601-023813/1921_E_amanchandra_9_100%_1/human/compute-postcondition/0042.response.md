Postcondition: ***_ is 2, t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), r, w, a, b, c, and d are integers assigned from the input, x is the integer part of the absolute difference between a and c divided by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If the absolute difference between a and c is odd, r is the minimum of w and d + x, l is the maximum of 1 and d - x, and either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between l and b is less than or equal to x + 1 and the absolute difference between r and b is less than or equal to x + 1. If the absolute difference between a and c is even, r is the minimum of w and b + x, l is the maximum of 1 and b - x, and either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between l and d is less than or equal to x and the absolute difference between r and d is less than or equal to x.***
