The code assigns the values from the input to the variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The input is a space-separated list of integers, and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The values of `t` and `_` are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**
