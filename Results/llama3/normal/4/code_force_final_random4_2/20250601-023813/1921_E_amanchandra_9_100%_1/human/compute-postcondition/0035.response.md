The code calculates the absolute difference between `a` and `c`, divides it by 2, and assigns the result to `x`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **_ is 2, t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), r, w, a, b, c, and d are integers assigned from the input, x is the integer part of the absolute difference between a and c divided by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**
