Output State: **_ is 2, t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), r, w, a, b, c, and d are integers assigned from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the values of `_` and `t` remain unchanged. The variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are assigned new values from the input, which are integers. The number of test cases in the stdin has decreased by one, as one test case has been processed.
