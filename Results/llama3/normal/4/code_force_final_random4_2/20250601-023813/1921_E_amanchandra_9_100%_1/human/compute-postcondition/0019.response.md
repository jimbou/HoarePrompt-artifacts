Output State: **_ is 1, t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), r, w, a, b, c, and d are integers assigned from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the values of r, w, a, b, c, and d are updated to the integers read from the input, while the values of _ and t remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one.
