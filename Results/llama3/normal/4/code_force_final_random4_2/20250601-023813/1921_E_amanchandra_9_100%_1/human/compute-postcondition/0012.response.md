Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers, `x` is an integer between 0 and (c-a)/2 inclusive, `a` is less than or equal to `c`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even***
