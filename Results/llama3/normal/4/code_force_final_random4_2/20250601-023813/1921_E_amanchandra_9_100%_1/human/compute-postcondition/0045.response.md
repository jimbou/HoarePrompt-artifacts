Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of six integers representing the dimensions of a board and the initial positions of two chips, Alice's and Bob's. It then determines the winner of a game based on the relative positions of the chips and prints the result, either 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw', for each test case. The function processes all test cases and consumes all input from standard input, leaving it empty.**
