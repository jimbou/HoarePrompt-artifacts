Output State: **_ is 1, t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), r, w, a, b, c, and d are integers assigned from the input, x is the absolute difference between a and c divided by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of x is calculated as the absolute difference between a and c divided by 2. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
