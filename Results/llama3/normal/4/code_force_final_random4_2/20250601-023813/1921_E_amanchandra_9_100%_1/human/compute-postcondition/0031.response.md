The only variables in the loop head are variables  _ and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, _ must be increased by 1, so _ is 2 and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 2.
State: **_ is 2, t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), r, w, a, b, c, and d are integers assigned from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**
