Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, r, w, a, b, c, and d are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If a is greater than c, 'Draw' is printed. If a is less than or equal to c, the output depends on the parity of the absolute difference between a and c. If the absolute difference is odd, either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed depending on the absolute differences between l and b, and r and b. If the absolute difference is even, either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed depending on the absolute differences between l and d, and r and d.***
