The only variable in the loop head is variable _ and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again _ must be increased by 1 so _ is 1 and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 1.
State: **_ is 1, t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), r, w, a, b, c, and d are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If a is greater than c, 'Draw' is printed. If a is less than or equal to c, the output depends on the parity of the absolute difference between a and c. If the absolute difference is odd, either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed depending on the absolute differences between l and b, and r and b. If the absolute difference is even, either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed depending on the absolute differences between l and d, and r and d.**
