The code prints either 'Draw' or 'Alice' based on the conditions `abs(l - b) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - b) <= x + 1`. Here, `l` is not defined in the initial state, so we assume it's a variable that has been assigned a value elsewhere in the code.

`x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2. `r` is the minimum of `w` and `d + x`. `b` is an integer assigned from the input.

If both conditions are true, it prints 'Alice'. Otherwise, it prints 'Draw'.

Since the exact values of `l`, `a`, `c`, `w`, `d`, `x`, `r`, and `b` are not provided, we can't determine the exact output. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either 'Draw' or 'Alice'.

Output: **'Draw' or 'Alice' (where the output depends on the conditions abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1)**
