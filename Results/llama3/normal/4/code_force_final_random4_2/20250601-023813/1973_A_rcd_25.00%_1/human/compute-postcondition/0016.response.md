Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), _ is 0, p1, p2, and p3 are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed), the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is an even number, p3 is less than p1 + p2, low is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, cur is equal to low, and the current value of p1 - cur is less than or equal to p2 - (p3 - cur), and this is printed: p1 - cur + p3, where p1 is an integer, cur is equal to low which is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, and p3 is an integer**
