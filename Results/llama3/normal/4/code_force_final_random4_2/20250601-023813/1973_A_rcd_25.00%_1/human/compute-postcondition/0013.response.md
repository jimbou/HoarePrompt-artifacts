To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `high >= cur` and adjust the states of `high` and `cur` accordingly, as they are the variables in the loop head.

Given that `cur` is equal to `low`, and `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, we know that `cur` is the smaller of these two differences.

The condition `high >= cur` will always be true because `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, making it greater than or equal to `cur` by definition.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states of `high` and `cur` for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), _ is 0, p1, p2, and p3 are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed), the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is an even number, p3 is less than p1 + p2, low is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, and cur is equal to low**
