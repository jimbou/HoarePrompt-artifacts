Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), _ is 0, p1, p2, and p3 are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed), the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is an even number, p3 is less than p1 + p2, low is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, and cur is equal to low.
Code of the loop:
while high >= cur:
    if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
        print(p1 - cur + p3)
        break
    else:
        cur += 1
else:
    print(p3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed), the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number, `p3` is less than `p1` + `p2`, `low` is the minimum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2`, and `cur` is either equal to `low` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `cur` is equal to `low` + 1 and `p1` - `cur` is more than `p2` - (`p3` - `cur`).
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed), the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number, `p3` is less than `p1` + `p2`, `low` is the minimum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2`. If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `cur` remains equal to `low`. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1 to `low + 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed), the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number, `p3` is less than `p1` + `p2`, `low` is the minimum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2` and `high` is greater than `low + 1`. If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, either `p1` or `p2` is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is either `low + 1` or `low + 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
