To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `high` and `cur` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `high >= cur`. At the end of the last iteration, `high` is greater than or equal to `cur + 1`, which already ensures that the loop can execute again. However, to make it certain that the loop will execute one more time, we need to ensure that `high` is greater than `cur`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, `low` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, `cur` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, `high` is greater than `cur`.**
