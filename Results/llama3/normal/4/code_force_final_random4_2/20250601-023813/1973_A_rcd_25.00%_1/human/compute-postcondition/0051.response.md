Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), _ is 1, p1, p2, and p3 are integers assigned values from the input, low is the minimum difference between p3 and p1 or p3 and p2, high is the maximum difference between p3 and p1 or p3 and p2, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed). If p1 - cur is less than or equal to p2 - (p3 - cur), the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, cur is increased by 1.***
