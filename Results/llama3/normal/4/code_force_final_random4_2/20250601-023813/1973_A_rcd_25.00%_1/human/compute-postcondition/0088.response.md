Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, `low` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, `cur` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, `high` is greater than or equal to `cur + 1`. If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, then the value of `p1 - cur + p3` has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is increased by 1 and `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`.***
