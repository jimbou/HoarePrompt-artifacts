Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), _ is 1, p1, p2, and p3 are integers assigned values from the input, low is the minimum difference between p3 and p1 or p3 and p2, high is the maximum difference between p3 and p1 or p3 and p2, cur is the minimum difference between p3 and p1 or p3 and p2, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed).**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The code only introduced new variables `low`, `high`, and `cur`, which are calculated based on the differences between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`. The `low` variable holds the minimum difference, the `high` variable holds the maximum difference, and the `cur` variable is initialized to the minimum difference. The state of `stdin` remains the same as it was not affected by the code.
