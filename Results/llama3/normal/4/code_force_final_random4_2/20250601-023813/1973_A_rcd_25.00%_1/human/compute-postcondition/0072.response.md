Based on the precondition, we can determine what will be printed when the `print` statement is executed.

The precondition states that `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, and the program skips to the next iteration of the loop if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. This means that the `print` statement will only be executed if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even.

The `print` statement prints the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Since `p1` and `p2` are integers, their sum will also be an integer.

Therefore, the output will be the sum of two integers, `p1` and `p2`, which is an integer value.

Output: **the sum of p1 and p2 (where p1 and p2 are integers assigned values from the input)**
