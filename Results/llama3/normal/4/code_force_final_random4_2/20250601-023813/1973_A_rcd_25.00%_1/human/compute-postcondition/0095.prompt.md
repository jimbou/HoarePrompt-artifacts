Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), _ is 2, p1, p2, and p3 are integers assigned values from the input, low is the minimum difference between p3 and p1 or p3 and p2, high is the maximum difference between p3 and p1 or p3 and p2, cur is the minimum difference between p3 and p1 or p3 and p2.
Code of the loop:
while high >= cur:
    if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
        print(p1 - cur + p3)
        break
    else:
        cur += 1
else:
    print(p3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), _ is 2, p1, p2, and p3 are integers assigned values from the input, low is the minimum difference between p3 and p1 or p3 and p2, high is greater than or equal to cur, cur is the minimum difference between p3 and p1 or p3 and p2. If p1 - cur is less than or equal to p2 - (p3 - cur), then the sum of p1 minus cur and p3 is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, cur is incremented by 1 and high is updated to be greater than or equal to the new cur value.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, `low` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, `cur` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, `high` is greater than or equal to `cur + 1`. If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, then the value of `p1 - cur + p3` has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is increased by 1 and `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, `low` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`. If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is updated to 1 plus the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, and `high` remains greater than `cur`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
