Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, `low` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, `high` is greater than `cur`. If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, the difference between `p1` and `cur` added to `p3` has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is increased by 1. `stdin` contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed).***
