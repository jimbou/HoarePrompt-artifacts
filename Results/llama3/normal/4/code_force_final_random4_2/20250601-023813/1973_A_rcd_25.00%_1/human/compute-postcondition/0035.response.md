State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed). If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number, then if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. Otherwise, `p3` is printed.**
