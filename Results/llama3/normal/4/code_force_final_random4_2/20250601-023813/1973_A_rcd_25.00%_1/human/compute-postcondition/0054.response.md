Output: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, `low` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, `high` is greater than `cur`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed), and this is printed: the difference between `p1` and `cur` added to `p3`**
