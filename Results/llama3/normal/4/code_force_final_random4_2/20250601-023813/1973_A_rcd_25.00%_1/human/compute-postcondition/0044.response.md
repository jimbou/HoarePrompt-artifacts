According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `high` and `cur`. If `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `high` is the maximum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, and `cur` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`. Since `cur` is the minimum difference, it is possible that `cur` is equal to `high`, but it is also possible that `cur` is less than `high`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the state of `cur` to be less than or equal to `high`.

State: **t is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), _ is 1, p1, p2, and p3 are integers assigned values from the input, low is the minimum difference between p3 and p1 or p3 and p2, high is the maximum difference between p3 and p1 or p3 and p2, cur is less than or equal to high, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed)**
