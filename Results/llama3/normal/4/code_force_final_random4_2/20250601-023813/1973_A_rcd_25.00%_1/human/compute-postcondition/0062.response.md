The code increments the value of `cur` by 1. The initial state of `cur` is not explicitly stated, but we know that `high` is greater than `cur + 1`. After the increment, `cur` will be equal to its previous value plus 1.

The values of the other variables (`t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and `high`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, `low` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, `high` is greater than `cur + 1`, and `cur` is increased by 1.**
