The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves to the next iteration. The values of the variables are not affected. Since we are inside a loop, we move to the next iteration. The output state is: `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed), and -1 is being printed and we move to the next iteration of the loop.
