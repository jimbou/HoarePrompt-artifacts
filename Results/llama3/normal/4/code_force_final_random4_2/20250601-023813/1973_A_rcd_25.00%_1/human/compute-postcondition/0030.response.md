Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number, `p3` is less than `p1` + `p2`, `low` is the minimum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2` and `high` is greater than `low + 1`, `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1`, either `p1` or `p2` is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the conditions that were true before the code was executed are still true. The only difference is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
