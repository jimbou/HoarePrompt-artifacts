Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, `low` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, `high` is the maximum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, `cur` is less than or equal to `high` and is increased by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed), and `p1 - cur` is more than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `cur` has been updated such that `p1 - cur` is now more than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`. The input stream still contains multiple test cases, and the values of `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and `high` remain the same.
