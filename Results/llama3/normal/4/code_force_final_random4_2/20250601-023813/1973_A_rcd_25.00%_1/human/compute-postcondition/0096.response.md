Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed). If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. If `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2` is calculated and stored in `low` and `cur`, and `high` is set to be greater than or equal to `cur`.***
