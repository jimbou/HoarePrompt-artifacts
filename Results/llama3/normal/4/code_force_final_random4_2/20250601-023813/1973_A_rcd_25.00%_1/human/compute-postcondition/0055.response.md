Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, `low` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, `high` is greater than `cur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and the difference between `p1` and `cur` added to `p3` has been printed.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the expression `p3 + (p1 - cur)` has been printed. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, with the first line consumed.
