Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed). If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues to the next line of code.***
