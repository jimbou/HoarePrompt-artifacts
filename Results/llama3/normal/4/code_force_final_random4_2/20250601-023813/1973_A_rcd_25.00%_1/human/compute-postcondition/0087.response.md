Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, `low` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, `cur` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2` plus 1, `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2` is still represented by `low`, and `high` is still greater than or equal to the new value of `cur`.
