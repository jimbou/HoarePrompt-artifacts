Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed). If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, -1 is printed and the program moves to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statement. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. Otherwise, the program calculates the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, and if `p1` minus the minimum difference is less than or equal to `p2` minus the maximum difference, the difference between `p1` and the minimum difference added to `p3` is printed and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the minimum difference is updated to the maximum difference.***
