Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games among three friends. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers representing the scores of the three players.

The program first checks if the total score is odd, in which case it prints -1, as the total score must be even. Then, it checks if the highest score is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores. If this condition is true, it prints the sum of the two lower scores, as this is the maximum possible number of draws.

If neither of these conditions is true, the program enters a loop where it iteratively adjusts the scores to find the maximum possible number of draws that can be achieved while satisfying the constraints. The loop starts with the minimum possible difference between the highest score and the lowest score, and increments this difference until it finds a valid solution or reaches the maximum possible difference.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases according to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
