Output State: **`t` is 0, `_` is `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed).**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0, and the variable `_` will be equal to the initial value of `t`. The variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will hold the values assigned to them from the input during the last iteration of the loop. The state of the input stream `stdin` remains unchanged, with multiple test cases still available for processing, but with the first line already consumed.
