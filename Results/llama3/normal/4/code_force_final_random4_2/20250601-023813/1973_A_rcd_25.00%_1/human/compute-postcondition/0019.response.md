Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed), the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number, `p3` is less than `p1` + `p2`, `low` is the minimum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2`, and `cur` is equal to `low` + 1, and `p1` - `cur` is more than `p2` - (`p3` - `cur`).**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, so it is now equal to `low` + 1. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, the relationship between `p3` and `p1` + `p2`, and the values of `low` and `high` still hold. The relationship between `p1` - `cur` and `p2` - (`p3` - `cur`) also remains valid.
