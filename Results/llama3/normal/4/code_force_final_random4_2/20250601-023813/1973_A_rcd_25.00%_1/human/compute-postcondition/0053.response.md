The code prints the difference between `p1` and `cur` added to `p3`. Where `p1` is an integer assigned a value from the input, `cur` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), and `p3` is an integer assigned a value from the input.
Output: **[p1] - [cur] + [p3] (where p1, cur, and p3 are the values of p1, cur, and p3 respectively)**
