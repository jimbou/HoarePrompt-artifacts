Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), _ is 2, p1, p2, and p3 are integers assigned values from the input, low is the minimum difference between p3 and p1 or p3 and p2, cur is the minimum difference between p3 and p1 or p3 and p2, high is greater than or equal to cur.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the values of the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The value of `cur` is now the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, and the value of `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`. The values of `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged.
