Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the total number of points is not a multiple of 2 correctly. In such cases, the program should print -1, but it does not. For example, if the input is 1 1 3, the program will print 2, but the correct output should be -1 because it is not possible to achieve this score with any number of games.

Also, the program does not handle the case when p1 + p2 < p3 correctly. In such cases, the program should print -1, but it does not. For example, if the input is 1 1 10, the program will print 2, but the correct output should be -1 because it is not possible to achieve this score with any number of games.

The program also does not handle the case when p1 = p2 = p3 correctly. In such cases, the program should print -1 if the total number of points is not a multiple of 3, but it does not. For example, if the input is 1 1 1, the program will print -1, but the correct output should be 1 because it is possible to achieve this score with one game that ends in a draw.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
