Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed).**

In this output state, the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are updated to the integers read from the input, while the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but the first line has been consumed.
