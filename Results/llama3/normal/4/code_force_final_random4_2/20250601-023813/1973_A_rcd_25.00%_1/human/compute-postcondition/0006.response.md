Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed). The current values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are such that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an odd number, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is still an odd number. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, with the first line consumed.
