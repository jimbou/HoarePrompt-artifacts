Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, `low` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, `cur` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, `high` is greater than or equal to `cur + 1`, the value of `p1 - cur + p3` has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `cur`, and `high` remain the same as in the initial state. The expression `p1 - cur + p3` has been printed, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
