Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), _ is 1, p1, p2, and p3 are integers assigned values from the input, low is the minimum difference between p3 and p1 or p3 and p2, high is the maximum difference between p3 and p1 or p3 and p2, cur is the minimum difference between p3 and p1 or p3 and p2, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed). If p1 - cur is less than or equal to p2 - (p3 - cur), the difference between p1 and cur added to p3 has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, cur is equal to high.**

This output state indicates that the loop has finished executing. If the loop broke out of the most internal loop or if statement, it means that the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` was met, and the difference between `p1` and `cur` added to `p3` has been printed. If the loop did not break out, it means that `cur` has been increased until it is equal to `high`, which is the maximum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`.
