Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, `low` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, `high` is greater than or equal to `cur + 1`, `cur` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2` plus one, and `p1 - (cur + 1)` is greater than `p2 - (p3 - (cur + 1))`.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, and the relationship between `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` has been updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.
