Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed)**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are assigned integer values from the input, which is a space-separated list of integers. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but the first line has been consumed.
