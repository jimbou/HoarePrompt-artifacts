Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, `low` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`, `cur` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, and the current value of `p1` minus `cur` is less than or equal to `p2` minus the difference between `p3` and `cur`, and the sum of `p1` minus `cur` and `p3` is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`, and `cur` remain the same, and the condition that the current value of `p1` minus `cur` is less than or equal to `p2` minus the difference between `p3` and `cur` still holds. The sum of `p1` minus `cur` and `p3` is still being printed.
