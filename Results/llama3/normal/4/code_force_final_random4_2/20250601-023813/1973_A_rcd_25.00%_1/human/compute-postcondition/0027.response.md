According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `high` and `cur`. If `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1`. To ensure the loop can execute again, `high` must be greater than `cur`. Since `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1`, `high` must be greater than `low + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed), the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number, `p3` is less than `p1` + `p2`, `low` is the minimum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2` and `high` is greater than `low + 1`, `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1`.**
