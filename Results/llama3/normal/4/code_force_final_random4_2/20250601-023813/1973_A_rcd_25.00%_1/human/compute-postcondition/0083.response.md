To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `high` and `cur`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`. At the end of the last iteration, `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`, but we need to ensure that `high` is still greater than or equal to `cur` after the increment of `cur` by 1.

So, we need to adjust the state of `high` to be greater than or equal to the new value of `cur`, which is `cur + 1`.

The state of `cur` does not need to be adjusted, as it will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.

The states of the other variables (`t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `low`) do not affect the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, `low` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, `cur` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, `high` is greater than or equal to `cur + 1`**
