The code prints the value of the expression `p1 - cur + p3`. 

Here, `p1` is an integer, `cur` is equal to `low`, and `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. Since `cur` is equal to `low`, `cur` is also the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. 

`p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number.

Output: **p1 - (minimum of (p3 - p1) and (p3 - p2)) + p3 (where p1, p2, and p3 are integers, p3 is less than p1 + p2, and the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is an even number)**
