Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, `low` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, `high` is greater than `cur + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the execution of the program continues outside of the current loop or if statement.
