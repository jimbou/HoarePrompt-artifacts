Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed), the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number, `p3` is less than `p1` + `p2`, `low` is the minimum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2`. If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `cur` remains equal to `low`. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1 to `low + 1`.***
