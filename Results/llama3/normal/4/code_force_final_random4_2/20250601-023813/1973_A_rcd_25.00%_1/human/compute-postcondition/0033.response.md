Output State: **p3 is printed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that p3 is printed. This is because the loop continues to execute as long as high is greater than or equal to cur. If p1 - cur is less than or equal to p2 - (p3 - cur), then the loop breaks and p1 - cur + p3 is printed. Otherwise, cur is incremented by 1. Since high is greater than low + 1 after the loop executes 3 times, the loop will continue to execute until cur is equal to high. At this point, p1 - cur will be less than or equal to p2 - (p3 - cur), so the loop will break and p1 - cur + p3 will be printed. However, since cur is equal to high, p1 - cur + p3 is equal to p3, so p3 is printed.
