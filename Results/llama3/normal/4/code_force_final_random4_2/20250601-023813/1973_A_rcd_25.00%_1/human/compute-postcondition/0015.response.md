The code prints the sum of `p1` and `p3`, minus the current value of `cur`. Since `cur` is equal to `low`, which is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, the value of `cur` is the smaller of these two differences. Therefore, the expression `p1 - cur + p3` can be simplified to `p1 + p3 - (p3 - p1)` or `p1 + p3 - (p3 - p2)`, depending on which difference is smaller.

Since `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, we know that `p3 - p1` is less than `p2`, and `p3 - p2` is less than `p1`. Therefore, the smaller of the two differences is `p3 - p1`, and the expression `p1 - cur + p3` simplifies to `p1 + p3 - (p3 - p1) = 2*p1`.

Output: **2*p1 (where p1 is an integer)**
