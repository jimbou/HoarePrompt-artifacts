The code prints the sum of the current values of `p1` and `p3`, minus the current value of `cur`. Where `p1` and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, and `cur` is a value less than or equal to `high`, which is the maximum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`.

Output: **p1 + p3 - cur (where p1 and p3 are integers assigned values from the input, and cur is a value less than or equal to high)**
