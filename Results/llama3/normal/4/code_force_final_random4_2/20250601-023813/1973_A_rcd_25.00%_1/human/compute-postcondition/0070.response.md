Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed), and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged. The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but the first line has already been consumed. The `-1` being printed is not affected by the `continue` statement.
