The variables in the loop head are `high` and `cur`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `high` and `cur`. If `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `high` is greater than `cur`. For the loop to execute one more time, `high` must be greater than the current value of `cur` plus 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, `low` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, `high` is greater than `cur + 1`.**
