Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed), the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number, `p3` is less than `p1` + `p2`, `low` is the minimum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2`, and `cur` is equal to `low + 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, so it is now equal to `low + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and `high` are still valid.
