Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
    if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
        print(-1)
        continue
    if p3 >= p1 + p2:
        print(p1 + p2)
    else:
        low, high = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)
        cur = low
        while high >= cur:
            if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                print(p1 - cur + p3)
                break
            else:
                cur += 1
        else:
            print(p3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed). If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number, then if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. Otherwise, `p3` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed). If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, -1 is printed and the program moves to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statement. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. Otherwise, the program calculates the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, and if `p1` minus the minimum difference is less than or equal to `p2` minus the maximum difference, the difference between `p1` and the minimum difference added to `p3` is printed and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the minimum difference is updated to the maximum difference.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed). If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. If `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2` is calculated and stored in `low` and `cur`, and `high` is set to be greater than or equal to `cur`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
