Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the cases where the total score is odd or the highest score is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores. In these cases, it prints -1 or the sum of the two lower scores, respectively. For other cases, it iteratively adjusts the scores to find the maximum possible score that can be achieved while satisfying the constraints.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the rules of the game as described in the problem statement. It also handles the edge cases correctly, such as when the total score is odd or when the highest score is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
