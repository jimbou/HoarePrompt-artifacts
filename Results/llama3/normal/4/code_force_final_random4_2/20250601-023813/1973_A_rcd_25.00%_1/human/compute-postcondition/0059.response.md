The code prints the difference between `p1` and `cur` added to `p3`. Where `p1` and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, and `cur` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive).

Output: **p1 - cur + p3 (where p1 and p3 are integers assigned values from the input, and cur is an integer between 1 and 499)**
