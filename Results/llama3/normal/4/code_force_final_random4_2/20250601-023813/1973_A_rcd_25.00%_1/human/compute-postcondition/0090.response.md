The code prints the result of the expression `p1 - cur + p3`. Let's break down the variables involved:

*   `p1` is an integer assigned a value from the input.
*   `cur` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`. This means `cur` is the smaller of the two differences `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
*   `p3` is an integer assigned a value from the input.

Since `cur` is the minimum difference between `p3` and either `p1` or `p2`, subtracting `cur` from `p1` effectively brings `p1` closer to `p3` by the minimum possible amount. Then, adding `p3` to this result gives a value that is `p3` plus the amount by which `p1` was adjusted closer to `p3`.

Output: **p1 minus the minimum difference between p3 and p1 or p3 and p2, plus p3**
