Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends, given their final scores.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the scores of the three players `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, which are guaranteed to be in non-decreasing order.

3. The program then checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` and moves on to the next test case. This is because the sum of the scores must be even, as each game can result in either a win (2 points), a loss (0 points), or a draw (1 point each).

4. If the sum of the scores is even, the program checks if the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores `p1 + p2`. If this condition is true, the program prints the sum of the two lower scores `p1 + p2`. This is because in this case, the maximum number of draws is achieved when the player with the highest score wins all their games against the other two players, and the other two players draw all their games against each other.

5. If the highest score `p3` is not greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores `p1 + p2`, the program calculates the range of possible draws by finding the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and the other two scores. It then iterates over this range, starting from the minimum difference, and checks if the current difference can be achieved by a combination of wins and draws. If it can, the program prints the current difference plus the highest score `p3`. If it cannot find a valid combination, the program prints the highest score `p3`.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
