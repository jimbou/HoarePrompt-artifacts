The code prints the sum of `p1` minus `cur` and `p3`. 

Here, `p1` is an integer assigned a value from the input, `cur` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, and `p3` is an integer assigned a value from the input.

Output: **p1 - cur + p3 (where p1 is an integer assigned a value from the input, cur is the minimum difference between p3 and p1 or p3 and p2, and p3 is an integer assigned a value from the input)**
