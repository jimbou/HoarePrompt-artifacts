Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), _ is 2, p1, p2, and p3 are integers assigned values from the input, low is the minimum difference between p3 and p1 or p3 and p2, high is greater than or equal to cur, cur is the minimum difference between p3 and p1 or p3 and p2. If p1 - cur is less than or equal to p2 - (p3 - cur), then the sum of p1 minus cur and p3 is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, cur is incremented by 1 and high is updated to be greater than or equal to the new cur value.***
