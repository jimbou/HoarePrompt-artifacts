The code prints the result of the expression `p1 - cur + p3`. 

Here, `p1` is an integer assigned a value from the input, `cur` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, and `p3` is an integer assigned a value from the input.

Since the exact values of `p1`, `cur`, and `p3` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the expression `p1 - cur + p3`.

Output: **p1 - cur + p3 (where p1 is an integer assigned a value from the input, cur is the minimum difference between p3 and p1 or p3 and p2, and p3 is an integer assigned a value from the input)**
