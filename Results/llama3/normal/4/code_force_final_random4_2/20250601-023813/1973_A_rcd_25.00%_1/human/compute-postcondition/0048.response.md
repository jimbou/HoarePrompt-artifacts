Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), _ is 1, p1, p2, and p3 are integers assigned values from the input, low is the minimum difference between p3 and p1 or p3 and p2, high is the maximum difference between p3 and p1 or p3 and p2, cur is less than or equal to high, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables retain their previous values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the execution of the program will continue from the next statement outside the loop or if statement.
