Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), _ is 2, p1, p2, and p3 are integers assigned values from the input, low is the minimum difference between p3 and p1 or p3 and p2, high is the maximum difference between p3 and p1 or p3 and p2, cur is the minimum difference between p3 and p1 or p3 and p2.**

The code calculates the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, and assigns these values to `low` and `high`, respectively. It then assigns the minimum difference to `cur`. The values of `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged. The state of stdin is not affected by this code snippet.
