Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed). If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an odd number, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, the program continues to the next statement.***
