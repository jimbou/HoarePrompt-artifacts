The code prints the value of `p1 - cur + p3`, where `p1` is an integer, `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1`, and `p3` is an integer less than `p1 + p2`. Since `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is greater than `low + 1`, we can infer that `cur` is either `p3 - p1` or `p3 - p2`. Therefore, the expression `p1 - cur + p3` simplifies to either `p1 - (p3 - p1) + p3` or `p1 - (p3 - p2) + p3`, which further simplifies to `p1` or `p2`, respectively.

Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed), the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number, `p3` is less than `p1` + `p2`, `low` is the minimum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2` and `high` is greater than `low + 1`, `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1`, and either `p1` or `p2` is being printed**
