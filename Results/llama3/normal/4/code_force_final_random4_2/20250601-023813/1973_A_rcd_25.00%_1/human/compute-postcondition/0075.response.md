To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `high >= cur` and adjust the states of `high` and `cur` accordingly.

Initially, `high` is the maximum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, and `cur` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`. For the loop to execute, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.

Since `cur` is already the minimum difference, we cannot adjust it further. However, we can adjust `high` to ensure it is greater than or equal to `cur`. To do this, we need to make sure that the maximum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2` is at least as large as the minimum difference.

Therefore, we can adjust the state of `high` to be greater than or equal to `cur`.

State: **t is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), _ is 2, p1, p2, and p3 are integers assigned values from the input, low is the minimum difference between p3 and p1 or p3 and p2, high is greater than or equal to cur, cur is the minimum difference between p3 and p1 or p3 and p2**
