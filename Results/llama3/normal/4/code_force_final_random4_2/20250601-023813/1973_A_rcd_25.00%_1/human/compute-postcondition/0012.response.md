Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), _ is 0, p1, p2, and p3 are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed), the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is an even number, p3 is less than p1 + p2, low is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, and cur is equal to low.**

In this final state, the values of `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with the first line consumed, as the code does not interact with stdin. The relationships between `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` also remain the same, with their sum being an even number and `p3` being less than `p1 + p2`.

The code introduces three new variables: `low`, `high`, and `cur`. The `low` variable is assigned the minimum value between `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, while the `high` variable is assigned the maximum value between these two expressions. The `cur` variable is then set to the value of `low`.
