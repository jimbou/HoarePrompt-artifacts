Output: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed). If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, -1 is printed and the program moves to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statement, and the sum of `p1` and `p2` is being printed**
