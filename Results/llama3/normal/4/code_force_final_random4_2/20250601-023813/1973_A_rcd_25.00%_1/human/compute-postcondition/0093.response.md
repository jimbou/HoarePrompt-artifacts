The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. The value of `cur` was the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, so the new value of `cur` is 1 plus the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, `low` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, `cur` is 1 plus the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, `high` is greater than `cur`.**
