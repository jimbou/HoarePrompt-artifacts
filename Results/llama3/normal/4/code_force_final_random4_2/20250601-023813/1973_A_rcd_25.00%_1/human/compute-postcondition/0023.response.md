The code prints the value of `p1` minus `cur` plus `p3`. Since `cur` is equal to `low`, which is the minimum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2`, we can substitute `low` for `cur` in the expression.

Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed), the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number, `p3` is less than `p1` + `p2`, `low` is the minimum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2`, and `cur` is equal to `low`, and this is printed: `p1` - `low` + `p3`**
