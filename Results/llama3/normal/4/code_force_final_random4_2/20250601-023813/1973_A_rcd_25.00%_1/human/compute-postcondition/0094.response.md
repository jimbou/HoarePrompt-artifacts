Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, `low` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`. If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is updated to 1 plus the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, and `high` remains greater than `cur`.***
