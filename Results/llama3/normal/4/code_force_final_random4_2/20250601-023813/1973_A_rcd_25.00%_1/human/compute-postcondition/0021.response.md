To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `high` and `cur` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`. At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is either equal to `low` or `low` + 1. 

If `cur` is equal to `low`, then `high` must be greater than `low` for the loop to execute again. 

If `cur` is equal to `low` + 1, then `high` must be greater than or equal to `low` + 1 for the loop to execute again.

Since `high` is the maximum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2`, and `low` is the minimum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2`, we can conclude that `high` is greater than or equal to `low`. However, we cannot conclude that `high` is greater than `low` + 1. 

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `cur` to be equal to `low` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed), the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number, `p3` is less than `p1` + `p2`, `low` is the minimum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2`, and `cur` is equal to `low`.**
