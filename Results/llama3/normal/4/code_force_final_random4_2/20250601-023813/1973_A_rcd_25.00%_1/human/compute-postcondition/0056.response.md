Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input, `low` is the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2`, `high` is greater than `cur`, `cur` is increased by 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed)**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `high` and `cur` is still valid, with `high` being greater than the updated value of `cur`. The input values for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are still assigned from the input, and the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p3` and `p2` is still stored in `low`. The value of `_` remains 1, and `t` is still an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive). The stdin still contains multiple test cases, with the first line consumed.
