The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from stdin, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs.**
