Postcondition: ***n is at least 3, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers from stdin, r is the smallest integer in a, rem is 0, y is 0, ii is 1, i is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then k is 0, r is the smallest integer in a plus k divided by 3, rem is the remainder of k divided by 3, y is n - 3. Otherwise, k is an integer equal to its original value minus (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]), r is the integer a[i + 1], rem is 0, y is 0.***
