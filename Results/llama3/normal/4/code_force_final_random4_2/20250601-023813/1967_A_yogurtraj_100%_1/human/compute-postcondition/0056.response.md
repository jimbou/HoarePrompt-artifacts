Output State: **n is an integer that is greater than 1, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is the second smallest integer in a, rem is 0, y is 0, ii is 2, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs. The value of k is reduced by the product of i+1 and the difference between the first two elements in a.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated by subtracting the product of `i+1` and the difference between the first two elements in `a`. The value of `r` has been updated to be the second smallest integer in `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
