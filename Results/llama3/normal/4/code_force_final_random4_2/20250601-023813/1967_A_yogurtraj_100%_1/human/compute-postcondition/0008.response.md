The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 3.
State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is 1, `r` is the value of `a[i]` plus `k` divided by `i + 1`, `rem` is the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`, and `y` is `n - 1 - i`**
