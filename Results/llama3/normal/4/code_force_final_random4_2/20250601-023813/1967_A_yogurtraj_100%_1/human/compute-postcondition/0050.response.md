The only variable in the loop head is variable ii, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable ii. If ii is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, ii is 1. For the loop to execute again, ii must be increased by 1, so ii is 2. The number of test cases is unknown, but it must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.
State: **n is at least 2, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers from stdin, r is the smallest integer in a plus k divided by n - 1, rem is the remainder of k divided by n - 1, y is 0, ii is 2, i is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs**
