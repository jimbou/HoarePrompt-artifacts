Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum score that can be obtained. The issue lies in the way it calculates the remaining cards after buying new cards. The program assumes that the remaining cards can be distributed evenly among the types, but this is not always the case.

For example, consider the input:

3 4
6 1 8

The program will calculate the maximum score as 15, but the correct answer is 22. The optimal rearrangement is [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1], which contains 22 subarrays that are a permutation of [1, 2, 3].

The program's incorrect calculation of the remaining cards leads to an incorrect maximum score. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
