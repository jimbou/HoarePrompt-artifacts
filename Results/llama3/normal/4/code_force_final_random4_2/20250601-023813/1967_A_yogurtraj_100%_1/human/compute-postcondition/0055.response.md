Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is 2, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs. The product of `i+1` and the difference between `a[i+1]` and `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`.***
