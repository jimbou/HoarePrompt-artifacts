To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1. These states do not guarantee that the loop will execute, so we need to adjust `n` to be at least 2 and `i` to be 0.

State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is 0**
