Postcondition: ***n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is an integer, rem is an integer, y is an integer, ii is 2, i is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs. If k is non-zero, then the program prints (r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n, where r is equal to a[n - 1] + k // n. If k is zero, then the program prints (r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y.***
