Postcondition: ***n is at least 3, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers from stdin, r is the smallest integer in a, rem is 0, y is 0, ii is 1, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then k is 0, r is a[i] + k // (i + 1), rem is k % (i + 1), y is n - 1 - i. Otherwise, k is reduced by (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]), r is the integer at index i + 1 in a, rem is 0, y is 0.***
