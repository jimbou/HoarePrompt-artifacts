Postcondition: ***`ii` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is 1, `y` is `n - 1 - i`. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is larger than `k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is the value of `a[i]` plus 0 divided by `i + 1`, and `rem` is the remainder of 0 divided by `i + 1`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to its original value minus `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is the value of `a[i + 1]`, and `rem` is the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`.***
