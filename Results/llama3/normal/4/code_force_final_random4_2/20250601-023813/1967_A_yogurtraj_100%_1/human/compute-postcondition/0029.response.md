Output State: **n is at least 2, k is 0, a is a sorted list of integers, r is the value of the element at index i in list a plus k divided by i + 1, rem is the remainder of k divided by i + 1, y is n - 1 - i, ii is 1, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs.**

In this final state, the value of `k` has been reset to 0, and the value of `r` has been updated to be the value of the element at index `i` in list `a` plus `k` divided by `i + 1`. The value of `rem` has been set to the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`. The value of `y` has been set to `n - 1 - i`. The values of `n`, `a`, `ii`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two inputs.
