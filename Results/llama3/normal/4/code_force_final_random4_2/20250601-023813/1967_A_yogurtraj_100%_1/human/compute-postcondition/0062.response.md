The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **n is an integer greater than 3, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is the smallest integer in a, rem is 0, y is 0, ii is 2, i is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then k is 0, r is the value of a[i] plus k divided by (i + 1), rem is the remainder of k divided by (i + 1), y is n - 1 - i. Otherwise, k is an integer equal to its original value minus (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]), r is the integer at index i + 1 in a, rem is 0, y is 0.**
