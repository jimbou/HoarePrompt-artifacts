Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is 0, a is a sorted list of integers, r is the value of a[i] plus k divided by i + 1, rem is the remainder of k divided by i + 1, y is n - 1 - i, and ii is 2.**

In this final state, the value of `r` has been updated to be the sum of the value of `a[i]` and the quotient of `k` divided by `i + 1`. The value of `rem` is now the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`. The value of `y` is now `n - 1 - i`. The value of `k` has been reset to 0. The values of `n`, `a`, and `ii` remain unchanged.
