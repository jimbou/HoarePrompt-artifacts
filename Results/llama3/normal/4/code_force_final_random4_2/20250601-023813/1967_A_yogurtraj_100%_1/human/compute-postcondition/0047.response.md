To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the variables and expressions involved in the print statement based on the given initial state.

1. **n**: It is stated that `n` is at least 2. This means `n` could be any integer greater than or equal to 2, but for the purpose of this calculation, we don't have an exact value.

2. **k**: `k` is given as 0.

3. **a**: `a` is a sorted list of integers from stdin. However, the specific values in `a` are not provided.

4. **r**: `r` is defined as the smallest integer in `a` plus `k` divided by `n - 1`. Since `k` is 0, `r` simplifies to the smallest integer in `a` plus 0, which is just the smallest integer in `a`.

5. **rem**: `rem` is the remainder of `k` divided by `n - 1`. Since `k` is 0, `rem` will also be 0, regardless of the value of `n`.

6. **y**: `y` is given as 0.

7. **ii** and **i**: While `ii` is 1 and `i` is `n - 1`, these variables are not directly involved in the print statement.

Now, let's substitute these values into the print statement:

```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)
```

Given the values we have:

- `r` is the smallest integer in `a`.
- `rem` is 0.
- `y` is 0.

The expression simplifies to:

```python
print((smallest integer in a - 1) * n + 1)
```

Since we don't know the exact value of `n` (other than it being at least 2) or the smallest integer in `a`, we cannot compute an exact numerical value for the expression. However, we can describe what will be printed based on the given information.

Output: **((smallest integer in a - 1) * n + 1) (where n is at least 2 and the smallest integer in a is the smallest element in the sorted list a)**
