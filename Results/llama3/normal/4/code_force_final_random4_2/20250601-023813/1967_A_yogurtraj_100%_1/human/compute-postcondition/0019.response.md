The code prints the result of the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`. To understand what this expression evaluates to, let's break down the variables involved:

*   `r` is defined as `a[n - 1] + k // n`, where `a` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is an integer, and `k` is an integer not equal to 0. The `//` operator performs integer division, which means it rounds down to the nearest whole number. So, `k // n` will be the quotient of `k` divided by `n`, ignoring any remainder.
*   `k % n` calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `n`. This will be an integer between 0 (inclusive) and `n` (exclusive).

Now, let's substitute these expressions into the print statement:

*   `(r - 1)` will be `a[n - 1] + k // n - 1`, which is the last element of the sorted list `a` plus the quotient of `k` divided by `n`, minus 1.
*   `(r - 1) * n` multiplies the result of the previous step by `n`, which will be the product of the last element of `a` plus the quotient of `k` divided by `n`, minus 1, and `n`.
*   `+ 1` adds 1 to the result of the previous step.
*   `+ k % n` adds the remainder of `k` divided by `n` to the result of the previous step.

Output: **(a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1 + k % n (where a is the sorted list of integers, n is an integer, and k is an integer not equal to 0)**
