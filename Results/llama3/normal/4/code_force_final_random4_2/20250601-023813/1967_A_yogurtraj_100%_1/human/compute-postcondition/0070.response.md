Output: **n is an integer, k is a non-zero integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is an integer equal to a[n - 1] + k // n, rem is an integer, y is an integer, ii is 2, and the current value of i is n - 1. stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, and this is printed: (r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n, where r is equal to a[n - 1] + k // n, and n is the integer, and k is the non-zero integer**
