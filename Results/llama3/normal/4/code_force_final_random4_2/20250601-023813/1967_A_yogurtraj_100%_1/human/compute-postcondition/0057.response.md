Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is 2, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is the value of `a[i]` plus `k` divided by `i + 1`, `rem` is the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and `ii` is 2. Otherwise, `r` is the second smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is 2, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, and the value of `k` is reduced by the product of `i+1` and the difference between the first two elements in `a`.***
