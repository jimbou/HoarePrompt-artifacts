Postcondition: ***ii is 0, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is the largest integer in a, rem is 0, y is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1. If k is not 0, the value of the expression (r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n is printed, where r is a[n - 1] + k // n. If k is 0, the value of the expression (r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y is printed, where r is the largest integer in the sorted list a.***
