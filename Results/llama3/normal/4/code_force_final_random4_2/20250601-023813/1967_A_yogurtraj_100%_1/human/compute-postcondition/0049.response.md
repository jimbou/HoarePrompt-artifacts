Postcondition: **n is at least 2, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers from stdin, r is the smallest integer in a plus k divided by n - 1, rem is the remainder of k divided by n - 1, y is 0, ii is 1, i is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs. If k is not 0, the program prints (r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n, where r is the largest integer in a plus k divided by n. If k is 0, the program prints (smallest integer in a - 1) * n + 1.**
