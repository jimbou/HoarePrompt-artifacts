Output: **ii is 0, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is a[n - 1] + k // n, rem is 0, y is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1. The current value of k is not 0, and this is printed: the value of the expression (r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n, where r is a[n - 1] + k // n, and k is the current value of k which is not 0**
