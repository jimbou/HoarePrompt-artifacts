The only variable in the loop head is variable  ii, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ii`. If `ii` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ii` is 0, and `int(input())` is an integer. For the loop to execute again, `ii` must be increased by 1.
State: **ii is 1, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is the largest integer in a, rem is 0, y is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases**
