Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers from stdin, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs. Additionally, the product of the difference between the next element and the current element in the list `a` and the next index `i + 1` is less than or equal to `k`***
