Output: **n is at least 2, k is not 0, a is a sorted list of integers from stdin, r is the largest integer in a plus k divided by n, rem is the remainder of k divided by n - 1, y is 0, ii is 1, i is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, and this is printed: (r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n**
