Output State: **n is at least 3, k is an integer equal to its original value minus (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]), a is a sorted list of integers from stdin, r is the integer at index i + 1 in a, rem is 0, y is 0, ii is 1, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `k` and `r`. The first line subtracts the product of `(i + 1)` and the difference between the integers at indices `i + 1` and `i` in list `a` from `k`. The second line assigns the integer at index `i + 1` in list `a` to `r`. The values of `n`, `a`, `rem`, `y`, `ii`, and `i` remain unchanged. The state of stdin also remains unchanged as no input operations are performed.
