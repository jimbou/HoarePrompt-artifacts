Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function sorts the integers, calculates a value r based on the sorted integers and k, and then prints a value calculated from r, n, and either k or the remainder of k divided by n, depending on whether k is 0 or not. The function repeats this process for each test case, emptying the standard input in the process.**
