Postcondition: ***`ii` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, then `k` is set to 0, `r` is the value of `a[i]` plus `k` divided by `i + 1`, `rem` is the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`, and `y` is `n - 1 - i`. Otherwise, `r` is the integer at index `i + 1` in `a`, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 0.***
