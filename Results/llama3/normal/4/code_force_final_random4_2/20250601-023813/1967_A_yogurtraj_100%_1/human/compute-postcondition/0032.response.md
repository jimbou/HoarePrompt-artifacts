Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from stdin, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is the value of the element at index `i` in list `a` plus `k` divided by `i + 1`, `rem` is the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, `ii` is 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs. Otherwise, `k` is an integer equal to its original value minus the product of the difference between the next element and the current element in the list `a` and the next index `i + 1`, `r` is the next integer in the sorted list `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs.***
