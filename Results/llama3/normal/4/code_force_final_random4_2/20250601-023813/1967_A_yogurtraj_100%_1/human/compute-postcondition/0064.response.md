Output State: **n is an integer greater than 3, k is an integer equal to its original value minus (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]), a is a sorted list of integers, r is the integer at index i + 1 in a, rem is 0, y is 0, ii is 2, i is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `k` and `r`. The first line subtracts `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from `k`, updating its value. The second line assigns the integer at index `i + 1` in `a` to `r`, changing its value. The other variables remain unaffected.
