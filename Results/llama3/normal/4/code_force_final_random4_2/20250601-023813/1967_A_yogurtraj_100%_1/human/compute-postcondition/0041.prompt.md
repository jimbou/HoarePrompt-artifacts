Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the first input, k is an integer equal to the second input, a is a sorted list of integers from stdin, r is the smallest integer in a, rem is 0, y is 0, ii is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n - 1):
    if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
        r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
        rem = k % (i + 1)
        y = n - 1 - i
        k = 0
        break
    else:
        k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
        r = a[i + 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from stdin, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is the value of the element at index `i` in list `a` plus `k` divided by `i + 1`, `rem` is the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, `ii` is 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs. Otherwise, `k` is an integer equal to its original value minus the product of the difference between the next element and the current element in the list `a` and the next index `i + 1`, `r` is the next integer in the sorted list `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is at least 3, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers from stdin, r is the smallest integer in a, rem is 0, y is 0, ii is 1, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then k is 0, r is a[i] + k // (i + 1), rem is k % (i + 1), y is n - 1 - i. Otherwise, k is reduced by (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]), r is the integer at index i + 1 in a, rem is 0, y is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is at least 3, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers from stdin, r is the smallest integer in a, rem is 0, y is 0, ii is 1, i is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then k is 0, r is the smallest integer in a plus k divided by 3, rem is the remainder of k divided by 3, y is n - 3. Otherwise, k is an integer equal to its original value minus (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]), r is the integer a[i + 1], rem is 0, y is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
