Postcondition: **`ii` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is 2, `y` is `n - 1 - i`. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, and `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to its original value minus `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `r` is `a[i + 1]`.**
