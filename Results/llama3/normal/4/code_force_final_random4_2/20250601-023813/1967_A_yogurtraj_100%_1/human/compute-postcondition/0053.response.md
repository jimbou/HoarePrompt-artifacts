Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is 2, and the current value of `i` is 0. Additionally, the product of `i + 1` and the difference between the elements at indices `i + 1` and `i` in list `a` is greater than `k`.**
