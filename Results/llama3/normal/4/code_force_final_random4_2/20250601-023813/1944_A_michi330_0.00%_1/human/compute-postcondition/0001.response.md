The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If t is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is a positive integer does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: two integers n and k, where n is a positive integer less than or equal to 100 and k is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n*(n-1)/2.**
