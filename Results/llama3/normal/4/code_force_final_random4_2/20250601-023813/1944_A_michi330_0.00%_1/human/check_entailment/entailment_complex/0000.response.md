Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k. It then prints the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit.

The program's logic is based on the fact that if k is greater than or equal to n-1, Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, making it impossible for Everule to visit any other island. In this case, the program prints 1. Otherwise, it prints n-1, indicating that Everule can visit all islands except the one that Dominater destroys.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. The use of the if-else statement ensures that the program prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
