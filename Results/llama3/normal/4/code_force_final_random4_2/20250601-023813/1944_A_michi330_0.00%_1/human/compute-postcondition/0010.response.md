The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 (since the step is 1), so `i` is 1, and `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 100, `k` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to `n*(n-1)/2`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, `n - 1` is printed.**
