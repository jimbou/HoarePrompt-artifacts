Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to `n*(n-1)/2`, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to be the two integers read from the input, which are a positive integer and a non-negative integer less than or equal to `n*(n-1)/2`, respectively. The stdin is now empty, as the input has been read.
