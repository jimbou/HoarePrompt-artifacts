This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k. It then prints the minimum number of operations required to make all pairs of elements in a set of n elements distinct, given that k pairs are already distinct. If k is greater than or equal to n-1, it prints 1; otherwise, it prints n-1. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.
