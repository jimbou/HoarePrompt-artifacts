Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 100, `k` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to `n*(n-1)/2`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**.

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the two integers from the input, where `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 100 and `k` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to `n*(n-1)/2`. The stdin now contains one less test case.
