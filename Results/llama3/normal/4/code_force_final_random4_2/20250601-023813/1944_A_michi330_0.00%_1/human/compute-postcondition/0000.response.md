Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: two integers n and k, where n is a positive integer less than or equal to 100 and k is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n*(n-1)/2.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first input from stdin, which is a positive integer. The remaining test cases in stdin are still present, each containing two inputs: two integers n and k, where n is a positive integer less than or equal to 100 and k is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n*(n-1)/2.
