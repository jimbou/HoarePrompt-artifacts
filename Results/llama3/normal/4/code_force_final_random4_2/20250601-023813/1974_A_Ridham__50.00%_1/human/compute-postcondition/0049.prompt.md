You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains t+1 inputs: the first input is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and the rest t inputs are pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        space_x = x * 1
        
        space_y = y * 4
        
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if space_x % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = space_x // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
        
    #State: n is 0, result is a list containing either screen_require_for_y or the sum of extra_screen and screen_require_for_y repeated t times, x is an integer, y is an integer, space_x is x, space_y is 4 times y, total_space is 5 times x plus 4 times y, remaining_cells is 15 times screen_require_for_y minus 4 times y, stdin is empty. If y is even, screen_require_for_y is equal to half of y. If y is odd, screen_require_for_y is half of y plus 1. If space_x is less than or equal to remaining_cells, result contains screen_require_for_y. Otherwise, result contains the sum of extra_screen and screen_require_for_y, where extra_screen is either a non-negative integer if space_x is a multiple of 15, or the ceiling of extra_space divided by 15 if space_x is not a multiple of 15.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
    #This is printed: screen_require_for_y repeated t times if space_x is less than or equal to remaining_cells, otherwise the sum of extra_screen and screen_require_for_y repeated t times (where screen_require_for_y is half of y if y is even, half of y plus 1 if y is odd, extra_screen is a non-negative integer if space_x is a multiple of 15, or the ceiling of extra_space divided by 15 if space_x is not a multiple of 15)

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
