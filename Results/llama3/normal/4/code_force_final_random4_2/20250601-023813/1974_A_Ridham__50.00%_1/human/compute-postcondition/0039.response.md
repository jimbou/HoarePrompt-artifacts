Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y` and `screen_require_for_y` and `screen_require_for_y`, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is `x`, `space_y` is 4 times `y`, `total_space` is 5 times `x` plus 4 times `y`, `remaining_cells` is 15 times `screen_require_for_y` minus 4 times `y`, stdin contains `n-7` inputs: pairs of integers `x` and `y`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y` divided by 2. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y` divided by 2 plus 1.**

In this output state, the list `result` has been updated to include an additional element, which is the value of `screen_require_for_y`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `n-7` pairs of integers `x` and `y`. The conditions for `screen_require_for_y` based on the parity of `y` are still applicable.
