Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is t, result is an empty list, stdin contains t inputs: pairs of integers x and y
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    space_x = x * 1
    space_y = y * 4
    total_space = space_y + space_x
    if y % 2 == 0:
        screen_require_for_y = y // 2
    else:
        screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
    remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
    if space_x <= remaining_cells:
        result.append(screen_require_for_y)
    else:
        extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
        if space_x % 15 == 0:
            extra_screen = space_x // 15
        else:
            extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
        result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is `x`, `space_y` is 4 times `y`, `total_space` is 5 times `x` plus 4 times `y`, `remaining_cells` is 15 times `screen_require_for_y` minus 4 times `y`, stdin contains `n-1` inputs: pairs of integers `x` and `y`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to half of `y`. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is half of `y` plus 1. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` contains the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is either a non-negative integer if `space_x` is a multiple of 15, or the ceiling of `extra_space` divided by 15 if `space_x` is not a multiple of 15.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y` and `screen_require_for_y`, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is `x`, `space_y` is 4 times `y`, `total_space` is 5 times `x` plus 4 times `y`, `remaining_cells` is 11 times `screen_require_for_y`, stdin contains `n-4` inputs: pairs of integers `x` and `y`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y` divided by 2. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y` divided by 2 plus 1. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, stdin contains `n-4` inputs: pairs of integers `x` and `y`. Otherwise, `extra_space` is `x` minus 11 times `screen_require_for_y`, and if `space_x` is divisible by 15, `extra_screen` is `x` divided by 15. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is `x` minus 11 times `screen_require_for_y` divided by 15 plus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y` and `screen_require_for_y` and `screen_require_for_y`, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is `x`, `space_y` is 4 times `y`, `total_space` is 5 times `x` plus 4 times `y`, `remaining_cells` is 15 times `screen_require_for_y` minus 4 times `y`, stdin contains `n-7` inputs: pairs of integers `x` and `y`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y` divided by 2. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y` divided by 2 plus 1. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, then `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y` and `screen_require_for_y` and `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y` and `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen` plus `screen_require_for_y`, and `extra_space` is `x` minus 15 times `screen_require_for_y` plus 4 times `y`. If `space_x` is a multiple of 15, `extra_screen` is `x` divided by 15. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is `extra_space` divided by 15 plus 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
