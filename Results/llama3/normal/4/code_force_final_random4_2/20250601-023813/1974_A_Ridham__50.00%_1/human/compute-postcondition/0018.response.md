Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `result` is a list containing one element which is the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is `x`, `space_y` is 4 times `y`, `total_space` is 5 times `x` plus 4 times `y`, `remaining_cells` is 15 times `screen_require_for_y` minus 4 times `y`, `extra_space` is `space_x` minus `remaining_cells`, stdin contains `n-1` inputs: pairs of integers `x` and `y`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to half of `y`. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is half of `y` plus 1. `space_x` is larger than `remaining_cells`. If `space_x` is a multiple of 15, `extra_screen` is a non-negative integer. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is the ceiling of `extra_space` divided by 15.**

In this output state, the value of `result` has been updated to include the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `n-1` inputs. The conditions regarding `space_x`, `remaining_cells`, `extra_screen`, and `screen_require_for_y` are still valid.
