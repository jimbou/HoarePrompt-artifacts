Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to calculate the minimum number of screens required to display a series of input pairs (x, y) on a 15-cell screen. The program correctly calculates the space required for each pair of inputs and determines the minimum number of screens needed to accommodate the x and y values.

The program first calculates the space required for the y icons, which are 2x2 cells in size. It then calculates the remaining cells available on the screen after placing the y icons. If the space required for the x icons is less than or equal to the remaining cells, the program appends the number of screens required for the y icons to the result list. Otherwise, it calculates the extra space required for the x icons and appends the sum of the extra space and the number of screens required for the y icons to the result list.

The program correctly handles the cases where y is even or odd, and where space_x is a multiple of 15 or not. It also correctly calculates the ceiling of extra_space divided by 15 when space_x is not a multiple of 15.

Overall, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given input pairs.

Correctness: **True**
