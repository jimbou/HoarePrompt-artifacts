Postcondition: **n is greater than 0, result is an empty list, x is an integer, y is an integer, space_x is x, space_y is 4 times y, total_space is 5 times x plus 4 times y, remaining_cells is 15 times screen_require_for_y minus 4 times y, stdin contains n-1 inputs: pairs of integers x and y. If y is even, screen_require_for_y is equal to half of y. If y is odd, screen_require_for_y is half of y plus 1. The current value of space_x is less than or equal to remaining_cells.**
