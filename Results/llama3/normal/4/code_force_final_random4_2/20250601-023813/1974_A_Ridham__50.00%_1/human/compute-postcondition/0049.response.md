Functionality: **This function calculates and prints the minimum number of screens required to display a series of input pairs (x, y) on a 15-cell screen, where x and y are integers between 0 and 99. For each pair, it determines the minimum number of screens needed to accommodate the x and y values, considering the screen's 15-cell width and the requirement for y to be displayed in a specific format. The function takes no arguments and returns no value, instead printing the calculated minimum number of screens for each input pair.**
