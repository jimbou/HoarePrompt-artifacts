Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place the application icons. It first calculates the total space required for the 1x1 and 2x2 icons, and then determines the number of screens needed to accommodate the 2x2 icons. If there is remaining space on these screens, it checks if the 1x1 icons can fit in this space. If not, it calculates the additional screens needed to accommodate the 1x1 icons.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including when there are no 2x2 icons, no 1x1 icons, or a combination of both. It also handles cases where the number of 1x1 icons is not a multiple of 15, which would require an additional screen.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
