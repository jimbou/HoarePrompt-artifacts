Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an integer, `y` is an odd integer, `space_x` is `x`, `space_y` is 4 times `y`, `total_space` is 5 times `x` plus 4 times `y`, `screen_require_for_y` is half of `y` plus 1, stdin contains n-1 inputs: pairs of integers x and y.**

In this output state, the value of `screen_require_for_y` has been calculated as half of `y` plus 1, where `y` is an odd integer. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains n-1 inputs: pairs of integers x and y.
