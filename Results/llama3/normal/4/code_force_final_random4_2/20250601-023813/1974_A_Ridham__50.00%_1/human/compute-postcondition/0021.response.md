Output State: **n is greater than 1, result is a list containing either screen_require_for_y or the sum of extra_screen and screen_require_for_y, x is an integer, y is an integer, space_x is x, space_y is 4 times y, total_space is 5 times x plus 4 times y, remaining_cells is 15 times screen_require_for_y minus 4 times y, stdin contains n-3 inputs: pairs of integers x and y.**

The code snippet reads a pair of integers x and y from stdin, updates the values of space_x, space_y, and total_space based on the new values of x and y, and does not affect the values of n, result, remaining_cells, or the remaining inputs in stdin. The value of space_x is updated to be equal to x, space_y is updated to be 4 times y, and total_space is updated to be the sum of space_x and space_y. The values of n, result, remaining_cells, and the remaining inputs in stdin remain unchanged.
