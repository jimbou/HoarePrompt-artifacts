The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since the first input is an integer `t`, `n` becomes `t`. Stdin now contains `t` inputs: pairs of integers `x` and `y`. The second line initializes an empty list `result`.

Output State: **n is t, result is an empty list, stdin contains t inputs: pairs of integers x and y**
