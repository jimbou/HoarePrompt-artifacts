Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is `x`, `space_y` is 4 times `y`, `total_space` is 5 times `x` plus 4 times `y`, `remaining_cells` is 11 times `screen_require_for_y`, stdin contains `n-3` inputs: pairs of integers `x` and `y`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y` divided by 2. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y` divided by 2 plus 1.**

In this output state, the value of `remaining_cells` has been updated to 11 times `screen_require_for_y`, as the code subtracts `space_y` (which is 4 times `y`) from the original value of `remaining_cells` (which was 15 times `screen_require_for_y` minus 4 times `y`). The other variables remain unchanged.
