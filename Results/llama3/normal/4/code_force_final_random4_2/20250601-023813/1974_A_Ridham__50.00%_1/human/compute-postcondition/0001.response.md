According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is `t`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is not used in the loop body, so it can be ignored.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `n` inputs: pairs of integers `x` and `y`**
