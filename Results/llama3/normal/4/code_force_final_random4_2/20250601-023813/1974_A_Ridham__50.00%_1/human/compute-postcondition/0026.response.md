Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y` and `screen_require_for_y`, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is `x`, `space_y` is 4 times `y`, `total_space` is 5 times `x` plus 4 times `y`, `remaining_cells` is 11 times `screen_require_for_y`, stdin contains `n-4` inputs: pairs of integers `x` and `y`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y` divided by 2. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y` divided by 2 plus 1.**

In this output state, the value of `result` has been updated by appending `screen_require_for_y` to the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `n-4` inputs instead of `n-3` because one pair of integers `x` and `y` has been consumed to calculate `screen_require_for_y`.
