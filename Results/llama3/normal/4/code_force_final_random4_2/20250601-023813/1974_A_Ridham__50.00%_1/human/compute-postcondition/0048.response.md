Output: **n is 0, result is a list containing either screen_require_for_y or the sum of extra_screen and screen_require_for_y repeated t times, x is an integer, y is an integer, space_x is x, space_y is 4 times y, total_space is 5 times x plus 4 times y, remaining_cells is 15 times screen_require_for_y minus 4 times y, stdin is empty. If y is even, screen_require_for_y is equal to half of y. If y is odd, screen_require_for_y is half of y plus 1. If space_x is less than or equal to remaining_cells, result contains screen_require_for_y. Otherwise, result contains the sum of extra_screen and screen_require_for_y, where extra_screen is either a non-negative integer if space_x is a multiple of 15, or the ceiling of extra_space divided by 15 if space_x is not a multiple of 15. The list result is printed, where each element of the list is printed on a new line.**
