Output: **screen_require_for_y repeated t times if space_x is less than or equal to remaining_cells, otherwise the sum of extra_screen and screen_require_for_y repeated t times (where screen_require_for_y is half of y if y is even, half of y plus 1 if y is odd, extra_screen is a non-negative integer if space_x is a multiple of 15, or the ceiling of extra_space divided by 15 if space_x is not a multiple of 15)**
