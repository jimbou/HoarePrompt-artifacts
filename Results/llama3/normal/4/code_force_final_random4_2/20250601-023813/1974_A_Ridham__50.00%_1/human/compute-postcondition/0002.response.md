Output State: **n is greater than 0, result is an empty list, stdin contains n-1 inputs: pairs of integers x and y, x is an integer, y is an integer, space_x is x, space_y is 4 times y, total_space is 5 times x plus 4 times y**

This output state reflects the combined effect of all lines in the code snippet. The initial state's information about `n` and `result` remains unchanged since they are not modified by the code. The state of `stdin` is updated to reflect that one pair of integers has been consumed, leaving `n-1` pairs. The new variables `x`, `y`, `space_x`, `space_y`, and `total_space` are introduced with their respective values based on the input and calculations performed in the code.
