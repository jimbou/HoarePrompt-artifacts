Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is `x`, `space_y` is 4 times `y`, `total_space` is 5 times `x` plus 4 times `y`, `remaining_cells` is 15 times `screen_require_for_y` minus 4 times `y`, `extra_space` is `space_x` minus `remaining_cells`, stdin contains `n-1` inputs: pairs of integers `x` and `y`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to half of `y`. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is half of `y` plus 1. `space_x` is larger than `remaining_cells`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `extra_space` is calculated as the difference between `space_x` and `remaining_cells`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `screen_require_for_y` and the relationship between `space_x` and `remaining_cells` still hold. The input in stdin remains the same, with `n-1` pairs of integers `x` and `y`.
