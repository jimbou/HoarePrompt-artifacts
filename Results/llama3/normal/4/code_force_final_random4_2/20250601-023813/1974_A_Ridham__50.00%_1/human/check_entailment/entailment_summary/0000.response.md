Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to calculate the minimum number of screens required to display a series of input pairs (x, y) on a 15-cell screen. The program correctly calculates the total space required for each pair of inputs, considering the space needed for both 1x1 and 2x2 icons. It then determines the minimum number of screens needed to accommodate this total space, taking into account the screen's 15-cell width and the requirement for y to be displayed in a specific format.

The program handles different scenarios correctly, including cases where the total space required is less than or equal to the remaining cells on the screen, and cases where extra screens are needed to accommodate the remaining space. The program also correctly handles cases where the input values are 0.

The execution summary provided confirms that the program behaves as expected, printing the correct minimum number of screens required for each input pair.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and execution summary, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
