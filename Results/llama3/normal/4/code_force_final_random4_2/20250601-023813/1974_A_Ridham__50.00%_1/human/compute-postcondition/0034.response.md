Output State: **n is greater than 2, result is a list containing either screen_require_for_y or the sum of extra_screen and screen_require_for_y and screen_require_for_y, x is an integer, y is an integer, space_x is x, space_y is 4 times y, total_space is 5 times x plus 4 times y, remaining_cells is 11 times screen_require_for_y, stdin contains n-6 inputs: pairs of integers x and y.**

The code executes as follows:

1. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to x and y. So now stdin contains n-6 inputs: pairs of integers x and y.
2. The second line assigns the value of x to space_x. Since x is an integer, space_x becomes an integer.
3. The third line assigns the value of y multiplied by 4 to space_y. Since y is an integer, space_y becomes 4 times an integer.
4. The fourth line assigns the value of space_y plus space_x to total_space. Since space_y is 4 times an integer and space_x is an integer, total_space becomes 5 times an integer plus 4 times an integer.

No other variables are affected by the code. The values of n, result, remaining_cells, extra_screen, and extra_space remain unchanged.
