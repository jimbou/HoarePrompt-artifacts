Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `result` is a list containing screen_require_for_y, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is `x`, `space_y` is 4 times `y`, `total_space` is 5 times `x` plus 4 times `y`, `remaining_cells` is 15 times `screen_require_for_y` minus 4 times `y`, stdin contains `n-1` inputs: pairs of integers `x` and `y`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to half of `y`. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is half of `y` plus 1. The current value of `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `result` has been updated to include `screen_require_for_y`, which is calculated based on the value of `y`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `n-1` pairs of integers. The relationship between `space_x` and `remaining_cells` is maintained.
