Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is `x`, `space_y` is 4 times `y`, `total_space` is 5 times `x` plus 4 times `y`, `remaining_cells` is 11 times `screen_require_for_y`, `extra_space` is `x` minus 11 times `screen_require_for_y`, stdin contains `n-3` inputs: pairs of integers `x` and `y`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y` divided by 2. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y` divided by 2 plus 1. If `space_x` is divisible by 15, `extra_screen` is `x` divided by 15. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is `x` minus 11 times `screen_require_for_y` divided by 15 plus 1.***
