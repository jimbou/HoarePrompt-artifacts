Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an integer, `y` is an even number, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to half of `y`, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is 4 times `y`, `total_space` is 5 times `x` plus 4 times `y`, stdin contains n-1 inputs: pairs of integers x and y.**

In this output state, the value of `screen_require_for_y` has been updated to be half of the current value of `y`, which is an even number. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains n-1 inputs: pairs of integers x and y.
