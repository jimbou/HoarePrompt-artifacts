To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(q):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `q`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `q` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `q` is greater than 1, it must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **n is an integer, q is greater than 2, a is a list of integers, x is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements, inds is a dictionary with a single key 0 and a list containing len(a) + 1 elements, i is 2, l and r are returned by func_1(n), lower is the value at index func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0 in the list inds[x[r]], upper is the value at index func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r) in the list inds[x[l - 1]]. If upper is greater than lower, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**
