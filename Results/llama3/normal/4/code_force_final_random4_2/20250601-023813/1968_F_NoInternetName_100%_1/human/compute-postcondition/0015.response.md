Output State: **n is an integer, q is greater than 0, a is a list of integers, x is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements, inds is a dictionary with a single key 0 and a list containing len(a) + 1 elements, i is 0, l and r are returned by func_1(n), lower is the value at index func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0 in the list inds[x[r]], upper is the value at index func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r) in the list inds[x[l - 1]].**

The code snippet does not modify the values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, `i`, `l`, or `r`. It only assigns new values to the variables `lower` and `upper` based on the values of `inds`, `x`, `l`, and `r`. The value of `lower` is determined by finding the index in the list `inds[x[r]]` that satisfies the condition `arg < l` using the function `func_4`, and if no such index is found, it defaults to 0. Similarly, the value of `upper` is determined by finding the index in the list `inds[x[l - 1]]` that satisfies the condition `arg <= r` using the function `func_3`.
