Output: **n is an integer, q is greater than 2, a is a list of integers, x is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements, inds is a dictionary with a single key 0 and a list containing len(a) + 1 elements, i is 2, l and r are returned by func_1(n), lower is the value at index func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0 in the list inds[x[r]], upper is the value at index func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r) in the list inds[x[l - 1]], and 'Yes' is printed**
