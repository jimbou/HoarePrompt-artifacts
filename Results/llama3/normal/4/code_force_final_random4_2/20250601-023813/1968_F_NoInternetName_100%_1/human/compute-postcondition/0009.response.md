Output State: **`n` is an integer, `q` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements, `inds` is a dictionary with a single key 0 and a list containing len(a) + 1 elements, `i` is 0, `l` and `r` are returned by `func_1(n)`**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, and `i` remain unchanged. However, `l` and `r` are assigned the values returned by the function `func_1` when called with the argument `n`. The specific values of `l` and `r` depend on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided.
