Output State: **`n` is an integer, `q` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is a list containing `len(a)` + 1 elements, `inds` is a dictionary with a single key 0 and a list containing `len(a)` + 1 elements, `i` is 1, `l` and `r` are returned by `func_1(n)`, `lower` is the value at index `func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l)` or 0 in the list `inds[x[r]]`, `upper` is the value at index `func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)` in the list `inds[x[l - 1]]`, and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration due to the `continue` statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
