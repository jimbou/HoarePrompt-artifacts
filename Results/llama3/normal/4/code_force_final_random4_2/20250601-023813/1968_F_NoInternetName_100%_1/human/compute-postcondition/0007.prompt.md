Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n and q are integers, a is a list of integers, x is a list containing a single element 0, inds is a dictionary with a single key 0 and a list containing a single element 0
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
    inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, q is an integer, a is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, x is a list containing two elements 0 and i, inds is a dictionary with a single key 0 and a list containing two elements 0 and the index of the second element in x, i is the first element in the list

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, q is an integer, a is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, x is a list containing three elements 0, the second element in a, and the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the second element in a and the second element in a, inds is a dictionary with a single key 0 and a list containing three elements 0, the index of the second element in x, and the index of the new element in x, i is the second element in the list

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, q is an integer, a is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, x is a list containing four elements 0, the second element in a, the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the second element in a and the second element in a, and the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the second element in a and the second element in a and the third element in the list, inds is a dictionary with a single key 0 and a list containing four elements 0, the index of the second element in x, the index of the new element in x, and the index of the new element in x, i is the third element in the list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
