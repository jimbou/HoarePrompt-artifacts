Output State: **n is an integer, q is greater than 2, a is a list of integers, x is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements, inds is a dictionary with a single key 0 and a list containing len(a) + 1 elements, i is 2, l and r are returned by func_1(n), lower is the value at index func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0 in the list inds[x[r]], upper is the value at index func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r) in the list inds[x[l - 1]].**

The code snippet modifies the values of `lower` and `upper` based on the values of `inds`, `x`, `l`, and `r`. The first line assigns the value at index `func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l)` or 0 in the list `inds[x[r]]` to `lower`. The second line assigns the value at index `func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)` in the list `inds[x[l - 1]]` to `upper`. The values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, `i`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
