Output State: **`n` is an integer, `q` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements, `inds` is a dictionary with a single key 0 and a list containing len(a) + 1 elements, `i` is 0, `l` and `r` are returned by `func_1(n)`, the current value of `x` at index `l - 1` is equal to the current value of `x` at index `r`, 'Yes' is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `q`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, `i`, `l`, and `r` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement.
