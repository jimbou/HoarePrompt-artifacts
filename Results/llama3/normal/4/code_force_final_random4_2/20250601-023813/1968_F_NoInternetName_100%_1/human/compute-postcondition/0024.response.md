Output State: **`n` is an integer, `q` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is a list containing `len(a)` + 1 elements, `inds` is a dictionary with a single key 0 and a list containing `len(a)` + 1 elements, `i` is 1, `l` and `r` are returned by `func_1(n)`, `lower` is the value at index `func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l)` or 0 in the list `inds[x[r]]`, `upper` is the value at index `func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)` in the list `inds[x[l - 1]]`.**

In this output state, the values of `l` and `r` have been updated to be the return values of `func_1(n)`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the values of `lower` and `upper` are still dependent on the updated values of `l` and `r`, but their exact values are not specified as they depend on the specific implementation of `func_3` and `func_4`.
