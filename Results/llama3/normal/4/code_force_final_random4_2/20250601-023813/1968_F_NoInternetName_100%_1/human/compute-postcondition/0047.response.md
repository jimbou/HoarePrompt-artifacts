Output State: **n is an integer, q is an integer, a is a list of integers, x is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements, inds is a dictionary with a single key 0 and a list containing len(a) + 1 elements, i is q - 1, l and r are returned by func_1(n), lower is the value at index func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0 in the list inds[x[r]], upper is the value at index func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r) in the list inds[x[l - 1]]. If upper is greater than lower, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times, with the only difference being that the variable i is now equal to q - 1, indicating that the loop has executed q times. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
