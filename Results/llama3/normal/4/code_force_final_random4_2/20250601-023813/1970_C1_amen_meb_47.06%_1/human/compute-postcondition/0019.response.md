Functionality: **The function reads input from stdin, expecting a series of lines containing two integers each, until a line with a single integer is encountered. It then returns a list of n-1 lists, where each sublist contains two integers. The first sublist contains the total number of nodes (n) and 1, while the remaining sublists contain pairs of integers representing edges in a graph. The function does not perform any validation or processing on the input data beyond parsing it into the desired format.**
