Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again, regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state.

State: **numbers is a list containing one list [n, 1], nums is a list containing two integers n and 1 (2 <= n <= 2*10^5 and t=1), stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers 1 <= u, v <= n, and finally one line containing one integer 1 <= u_1 <= n**
