Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list containing two lists [[n, 1], [num1, num2]], `nums` is a list containing two strings, stdin contains n-3 lines each containing two integers 1 <= u, v <= n, and finally one line containing one integer 1 <= u_1 <= n, `num1` is an integer, `num2` is an integer. If the length of `nums` is not equal to 2, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the function continues to execute.***
