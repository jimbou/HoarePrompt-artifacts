Output State: **`numbers` is a list containing two lists [[n, 1], [num1, num2]], `nums` is a list containing two strings, stdin contains n-3 lines each containing two integers 1 <= u, v <= n, and finally one line containing one integer 1 <= u_1 <= n, `num1` is an integer, `num2` is an integer.**

The code `nums = input().split()` accepts a line of input from stdin, splits it into two strings using space as the delimiter, and assigns the result to `nums`. Since stdin initially contains n-2 lines each containing two integers, and one line containing one integer, after executing this code, stdin will contain n-3 lines each containing two integers, and one line containing one integer. The values of `numbers`, `num1`, and `num2` remain unchanged.
