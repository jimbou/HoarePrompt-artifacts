Output State: **`numbers` is a list containing two lists [[n, 1], [num1, num2]], `nums` is a list containing two strings, stdin contains n-4 lines each containing two integers 1 <= u, v <= n, `num1` is an integer, `num2` is an integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `numbers`, `nums`, `num1`, and `num2` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains n-4 lines each containing two integers 1 <= u, v <= n, because we broke out of the loop or if statement that was reading the input. The break statement does not affect the values of the variables, but it changes the control flow of the program, so we include the information that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
