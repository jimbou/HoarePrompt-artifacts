Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `numbers` is an empty list, stdin contains three inputs: first two integers n and t (2 <= n <= 2*10^5 and t=1), then n-1 lines each containing two integers 1 <= u, v <= n, and finally one line containing one integer 1 <= u_1 <= n.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    nums = input().split()
    if len(nums) != 2:
        break
    num1 = int(nums[0])
    num2 = int(nums[1])
    numbers.append([num1, num2])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: numbers is a list containing one list [n, 1], nums is a list containing two integers n and 1 (2 <= n <= 2*10^5 and t=1), stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers 1 <= u, v <= n, and finally one line containing one integer 1 <= u_1 <= n.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: numbers is a list containing two lists [[n, 1], [num1, num2]], nums is a list containing two strings, stdin contains n-2 lines each containing two integers 1 <= u, v <= n, and finally one line containing one integer 1 <= u_1 <= n, num1 is an integer, num2 is an integer.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: numbers is a list containing three lists [[n, 1], [num1, num2], [num1, num2]], num1 is an integer equal to the integer value of the first string in nums, num2 is an integer equal to the integer value of the second string in nums, nums is a list containing two strings, stdin contains n-3 lines each containing two integers 1 <= u, v <= n, and finally one line containing one integer 1 <= u_1 <= n.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
