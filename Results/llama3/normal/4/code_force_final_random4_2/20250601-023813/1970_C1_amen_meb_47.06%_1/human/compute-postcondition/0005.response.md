Postcondition: ***`numbers` is an empty list. If `nums` is not a list of two integers, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `nums` is a list containing two integers n and t (2 <= n <= 2*10^5 and t=1), stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers 1 <= u, v <= n, and finally one line containing one integer 1 <= u_1 <= n.***
