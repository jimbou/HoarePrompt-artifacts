Postcondition: ***`numbers` is an empty list, `nums` is a list containing two integers n and t (2 <= n <= 2*10^5 and t=1), stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers 1 <= u, v <= n, and finally one line containing one integer 1 <= u_1 <= n. The current value of `nums` is not a list of two integers***
