You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains three inputs: first two integers n and t (2 <= n <= 2*10^5 and t=1), then n-1 lines each containing two integers 1 <= u, v <= n, and finally one line containing one integer 1 <= u_1 <= n.
    numbers = []
    while True:
        nums = input().split()
        
        if len(nums) != 2:
            break
        
        num1 = int(nums[0])
        
        num2 = int(nums[1])
        
        numbers.append([num1, num2])
        
    #State: numbers is a list containing n-1 lists [[n, 1], [num1, num2], ..., [num1, num2]], nums is a list containing two strings, stdin contains one line containing one integer 1 <= u_1 <= n, num1 is an integer, num2 is an integer.
    return numbers
    #The program returns a list of n-1 lists, where the first list contains two integers n and 1, and the remaining lists contain two integers num1 and num2, and n is an integer between 1 and the value of u_1 read from stdin.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of n-1 lists, where the first list contains two integers n and 1, and the remaining lists contain two integers num1 and num2, and n is an integer between 1 and the value of u_1 read from stdin.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
