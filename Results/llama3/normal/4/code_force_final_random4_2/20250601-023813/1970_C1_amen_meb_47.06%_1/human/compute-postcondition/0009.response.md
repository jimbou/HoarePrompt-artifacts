Output State: **`numbers` is a list containing one list [n, 1], `nums` is a list containing two strings, stdin contains n-2 lines each containing two integers 1 <= u, v <= n, and finally one line containing one integer 1 <= u_1 <= n and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `numbers` and `nums` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains the same input as before. However, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
