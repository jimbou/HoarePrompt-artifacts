Output State: **`numbers` is an empty list, `nums` is not a list of two integers, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers 1 <= u, v <= n, and finally one line containing one integer 1 <= u_1 <= n, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` does not change the values of the variables `numbers` and `nums`. However, it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement that it is directly inside. The stdin still contains n-1 lines each containing two integers 1 <= u, v <= n, and finally one line containing one integer 1 <= u_1 <= n.
