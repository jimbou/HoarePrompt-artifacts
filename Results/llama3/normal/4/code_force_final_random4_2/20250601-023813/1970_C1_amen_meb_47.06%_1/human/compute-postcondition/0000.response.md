Output State: **`numbers` is an empty list, stdin contains three inputs: first two integers n and t (2 <= n <= 2*10^5 and t=1), then n-1 lines each containing two integers 1 <= u, v <= n, and finally one line containing one integer 1 <= u_1 <= n.**

In natural language, the output state is that a new empty list called `numbers` has been created, and the state of the standard input (stdin) remains unchanged, still containing the three inputs: the first two integers `n` and `t` (where `n` is between 2 and 2*10^5, and `t` is 1), followed by `n-1` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v` between 1 and `n`, and finally one line containing a single integer `u_1` between 1 and `n`.
