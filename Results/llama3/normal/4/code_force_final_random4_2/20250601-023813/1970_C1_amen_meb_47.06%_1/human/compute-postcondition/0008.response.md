Output State: **`numbers` is a list containing one list [n, 1], `nums` is a list containing two strings, stdin contains n-2 lines each containing two integers 1 <= u, v <= n, and finally one line containing one integer 1 <= u_1 <= n**

In this output state, the value of `nums` has been updated to a list containing two strings, which are the first two inputs from the stdin. The stdin now contains n-2 lines each containing two integers 1 <= u, v <= n, and finally one line containing one integer 1 <= u_1 <= n. The value of `numbers` remains unchanged.
