Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again, regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state.

State: **numbers is a list containing two lists [[n, 1], [num1, num2]], nums is a list containing two strings, stdin contains n-2 lines each containing two integers 1 <= u, v <= n, and finally one line containing one integer 1 <= u_1 <= n, num1 is an integer, num2 is an integer.**
