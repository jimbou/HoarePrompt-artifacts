Postcondition: ***`numbers` is a list containing one list [n, 1], `nums` is a list containing two strings, stdin contains n-2 lines each containing two integers 1 <= u, v <= n, and finally one line containing one integer 1 <= u_1 <= n. If the length of `nums` is not equal to 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.***
