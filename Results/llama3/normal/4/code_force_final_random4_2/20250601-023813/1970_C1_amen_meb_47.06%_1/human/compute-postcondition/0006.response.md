Output State: **numbers is a list containing one list [n, 1], nums is a list containing two integers n and 1 (2 <= n <= 2*10^5 and t=1), stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers 1 <= u, v <= n, and finally one line containing one integer 1 <= u_1 <= n.**

The code snippet assigns the values of `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` to `num1` and `num2`, respectively. Since `nums` is a list containing two integers `n` and `1`, `num1` becomes `n` and `num2` becomes `1`. The third line appends a new list containing `num1` and `num2` to the `numbers` list. As a result, `numbers` now contains one list `[n, 1]`. The state of `nums` and stdin remains unchanged.
