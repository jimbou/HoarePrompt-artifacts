Postcondition: ***`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to n, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is 0, `r` is equal to the length of the array, and `mid` is equal to half of the length of the array. The value of `array[mid]` is larger than `find`.***
