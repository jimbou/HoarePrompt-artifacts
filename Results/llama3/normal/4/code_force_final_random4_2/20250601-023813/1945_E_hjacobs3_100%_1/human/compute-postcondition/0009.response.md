Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to n, `n` is greater than 1, `r` must be greater than `l + 1`, `mid` is an integer equal to the average of `l` and `r`, rounded down to the nearest whole number.**

In this output state, the value of `mid` is calculated as the average of `l` and `r`, rounded down to the nearest whole number, using the formula `(l + r) // 2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
