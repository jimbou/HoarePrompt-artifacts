Postcondition: ***`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to n, `n` is greater than 1, `mid` is now equal to the average of `l` and `r`, rounded down to the nearest whole number. If `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, then `l` is updated to `mid`. Otherwise, `r` is updated to `mid`.***
