Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to n, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is 0, `r` is equal to half of the length of the array, and `mid` is equal to half of the length of the array. The value of `array[mid]` is larger than `find`.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, which is half of the length of the array. The other variables remain unchanged. The array still contains distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and the value of `array[mid]` is still larger than `find`. The value of `n` is still greater than 1, and `l` is still 0.
