Postcondition: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to n, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is 0, `r` is equal to the length of the array, and `mid` is equal to half of the length of the array. The current value of `array[mid]` is less than or equal to the current value of `find`.**
