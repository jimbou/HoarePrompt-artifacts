Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the permutation and the number to be found. It then reads the permutation and calls the function `func_1` to perform the binary search.

The function `func_1` performs a binary search on the permutation to find the index of the target number. If the target number is not found at the expected index, it returns a list containing two strings: the expected index plus one and the actual index plus one. If the target number is found at the expected index, it prints 0.

The program then prints the result of the function call, which is either a list of two strings or the string '0'.

The program correctly implements the binary search algorithm and handles the case where the target number is not found at the expected index. It also correctly prints the result of the function call.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The function `func_1` is supposed to return the number of operations performed, but it returns a list of strings instead. The correct implementation should return the number of operations performed, which is either 0 or 1, and then print the indices of the elements to be swapped if the number of operations is 1.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
