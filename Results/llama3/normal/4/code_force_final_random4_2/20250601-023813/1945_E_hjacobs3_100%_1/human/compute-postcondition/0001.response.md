To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `r - l > 1`. This condition depends on the values of `r` and `l`.

Given that `l` is 0 and `r` is equal to the length of the array, we can substitute these values into the condition. Since `r` is the length of the array and `n` is also the length of the array, we can say `r = n`.

The condition then becomes `n - 0 > 1`, which simplifies to `n > 1`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n`, which must be greater than 1.

State: **array is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, find is an integer from 1 to n, n must be greater than 1, l is 0, and r is equal to the length of the array.**
