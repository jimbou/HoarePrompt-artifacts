Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to n, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is an integer equal to the average of `l` and `r`, rounded down to the nearest whole number, `mid` is an integer equal to the average of `l` and `r`, rounded down to the nearest whole number, `l` is less than `r`**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, which is the average of `l` and `r`, rounded down to the nearest whole number. The other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `l` and `r` is still maintained, with `l` being less than `r`.
