To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `r` and `l`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `r - l > 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `r` must be greater than `l + 1`. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `r` and `l` so that `r - l` is still greater than 1.

Since `mid` is an integer equal to the average of `l` and `r`, rounded down to the nearest whole number, and `l` is updated to `mid` if `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, we need to ensure that `r` is greater than `mid + 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to n, `n` is greater than 1, `r` must be greater than `mid + 1`, `mid` is an integer equal to the average of `l` and `r`, rounded down to the nearest whole number. If `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, then `l` is now equal to `mid`. Otherwise, `r` is updated to `mid`**
