Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to n, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is equal to `mid`, `mid` is now equal to the average of `l` and `r`, rounded down to the nearest whole number, `l` is either equal to `mid` or its previous value**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to be equal to `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `mid` and `l` and `r` is still valid, but now `r` is specifically equal to `mid`.
