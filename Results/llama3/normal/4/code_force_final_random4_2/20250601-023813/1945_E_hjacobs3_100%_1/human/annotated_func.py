#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, find is an integer from 1 to n, and n is the length of the array.
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
        
    #State: l is equal to r, array is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, find is an integer from 1 to n, n is the length of the array.
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns a list containing two strings. The first string is the value of l plus 1, where l is equal to r and is not equal to the index of find in the array. The second string is the index of find in the array plus 1, where find is an integer from 1 to n and n is the length of the array.
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: l is equal to r, array is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, find is an integer from 1 to n, n is the length of the array. l is equal to the index of find in the array, and 0 is being printed

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a binary search on a list of distinct integers to find the index of a target integer. If the target integer is not found at the expected index, it returns a list containing two strings: the expected index plus one and the actual index plus one. If the target integer is found at the expected index, it prints 0.
