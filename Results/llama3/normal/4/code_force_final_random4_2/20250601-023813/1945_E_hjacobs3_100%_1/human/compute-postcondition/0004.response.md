Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to n, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is equal to half of the length of the array, `r` is equal to the length of the array, and `mid` is equal to half of the length of the array. The current value of `array[mid]` is less than or equal to the current value of `find`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, which is half of the length of the array. The other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `array[mid]` and `find` is still valid, meaning that the current value of `array[mid]` is less than or equal to the current value of `find`.
