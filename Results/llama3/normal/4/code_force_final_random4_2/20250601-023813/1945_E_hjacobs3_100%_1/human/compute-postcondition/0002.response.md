Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to n, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is 0, `r` is equal to the length of the array, and `mid` is equal to half of the length of the array.**

In this output state, the value of `mid` is calculated as the average of `l` and `r`, which are the left and right boundaries of the array. Since `l` is 0 and `r` is equal to the length of the array, `mid` is equal to half of the length of the array. The other variables remain unchanged.
