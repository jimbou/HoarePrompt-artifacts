Output State: **l is equal to r, array is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, find is an integer from 1 to n, n is the length of the array.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `l` is equal to `r`, and the other variables remain unchanged. This means that the loop has converged to a single index in the array, and the search for the target value `find` has been narrowed down to that index.
