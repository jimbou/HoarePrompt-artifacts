Output State: **array is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, find is an integer from 1 to n, n is the length of the array, l is 0, and r is equal to the length of the array.**

The code first assigns the length of the array to the variable n. Since the length of the array is already defined as n in the initial state, this line does not change the value of n. The second line assigns 0 to the variable l and the length of the array (which is n) to the variable r. No other variables are affected by the code.
