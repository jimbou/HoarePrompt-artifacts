Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It performs a binary search on the input array to find the target integer `x`. If the target integer is not found at the expected index, it returns a list containing two strings: the expected index plus one and the actual index plus one. This corresponds to the required output format, which is the number of operations performed (in this case, 1) followed by the indices of the elements to be swapped.

The program correctly handles the case where the target integer is found at the expected index, in which case it prints 0, indicating that no operations are needed.

The execution summary accurately describes the behavior of the program, and the provided example input and output match the expected output format.

Correctness: **True**
