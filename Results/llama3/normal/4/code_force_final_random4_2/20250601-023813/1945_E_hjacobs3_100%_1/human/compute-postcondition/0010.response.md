Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to n, `n` is greater than 1, `r` must be greater than `l + 1`, `mid` is an integer equal to the average of `l` and `r`, rounded down to the nearest whole number, `l` is now equal to `mid`**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of integers, the value to be found, and the total number of elements remain unchanged. The right boundary is still greater than the left boundary plus one. The middle index is still the average of the left and right boundaries, rounded down. However, the left boundary is now updated to be equal to the middle index.
