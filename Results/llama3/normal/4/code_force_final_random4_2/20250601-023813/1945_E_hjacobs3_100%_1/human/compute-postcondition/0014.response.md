Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to n, `n` is greater than 1, `r` must be greater than `mid + 1`, `mid` is now equal to the average of `l` and `r`, rounded down to the nearest whole number, `l` is either equal to `mid` or its previous value, `r` is either equal to `mid` or its previous value**.

In this output state, the value of `mid` has been updated to the average of `l` and `r`, rounded down to the nearest whole number. The values of `array`, `find`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged. The value of `l` is either updated to `mid` or remains the same, depending on the comparison between `array[mid]` and `find`. Similarly, the value of `r` is either updated to `mid` or remains the same, depending on the same comparison.
