Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using binary search. However, the permutation is not sorted, and the program is allowed to perform at most two swaps to make the binary search work.

The program first reads the input, which includes the number of test cases `t`, the length of the permutation `n`, the number to be found `x`, and the permutation `p` itself.

The program then calls the function `func_1` with the permutation `p` and the number to be found `x` as arguments. The function `func_1` performs the binary search and returns a list of strings representing the swaps needed to make the binary search work.

The program then prints the result of the function call, which is either a list of swaps or the number 0 indicating that no swaps are needed.

The key part of the program is the function `func_1`, which performs the binary search and determines the swaps needed. The function first initializes the variables `l` and `r` to 0 and `n`, respectively, where `n` is the length of the permutation.

The function then enters a loop that continues until `r - l` is greater than 1. In each iteration of the loop, the function calculates the midpoint `mid` of the range `[l, r]` and checks if the element at index `mid` is less than or equal to the number to be found `x`. If it is, the function sets `l` to `mid`; otherwise, it sets `r` to `mid`.

After the loop, the function checks if the index `l` is equal to the index of the number to be found `x` in the permutation. If it is not, the function prints 1 and returns a list containing two strings: the value of `l` plus 1 and the index of `x` in the permutation plus 1. This indicates that one swap is needed to make the binary search work.

If the index `l` is equal to the index of the number to be found `x` in the permutation, the function prints 0 and returns an empty list. This indicates that no swaps are needed to make the binary search work.

Overall, the program is correct because it correctly implements the binary search algorithm and determines the swaps needed to make the binary search work. The program also correctly handles the case where no swaps are needed.

Correctness: **True**
