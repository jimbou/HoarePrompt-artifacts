Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to n, `n` is greater than 1, `r` must be greater than `mid + 1`, `mid` is now equal to the average of `l` and `r`, rounded down to the nearest whole number, `l` is equal to `mid`**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `r` and `mid` is still valid, and `r` must be greater than `mid + 1`. The properties of `array`, `find`, and `n` are also preserved.
