Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: array is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, find is an integer from 1 to n, n is the length of the array, l is 0, and r is equal to the length of the array.
Code of the loop:
while r - l > 1:
    mid = (l + r) // 2
    if array[mid] <= find:
        l = mid
    else:
        r = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to n, `n` is greater than 1. If `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, then `l` is updated to half of the length of the array and `r` remains the length of the array. Otherwise, `l` remains 0 and `r` is updated to half of the length of the array.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to n, `n` is greater than 1, `r` must be greater than `l + 1`, `mid` is an integer equal to the average of `l` and `r`, rounded down to the nearest whole number. If `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, then `l` is now equal to `mid`. Otherwise, `r` is updated to `mid`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to n, `n` is greater than 1, `mid` is now equal to the average of `l` and `r`, rounded down to the nearest whole number. If `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, then `l` is updated to `mid`. Otherwise, `r` is updated to `mid`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
