Let's analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration and the loop head.

The loop head is `for i in range(n):`, which means the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `i` is 1, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains an empty sequence of lines.**
