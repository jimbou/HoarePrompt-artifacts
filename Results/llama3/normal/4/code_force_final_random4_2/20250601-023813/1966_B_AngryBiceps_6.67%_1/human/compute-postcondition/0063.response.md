Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, i is n-1, a is a list containing n strings, first_row is a string of n characters, last_row is a string of n characters, _ is t-1, stdin contains an empty sequence of lines. If the first string in the list a contains only one unique character and is not equal to the last string in the list a, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variables in the loop head and body have reached their final values. The loop has iterated t-1 times, and the variable _ has reached the value t-1. The input has been fully consumed, and the stdin contains an empty sequence of lines. The list a contains n strings, and the strings first_row and last_row contain n characters each. The variables n, m, and i are integers, and i has reached the value n-1. The output is either 'NO' or 'YES', depending on whether the first string in the list a contains only one unique character and is not equal to the last string in the list a.
