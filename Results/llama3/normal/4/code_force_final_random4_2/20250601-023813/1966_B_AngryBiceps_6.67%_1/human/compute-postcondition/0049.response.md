Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, m is an integer, i is 2, a is a list containing two strings, first_row is a string of two characters, last_row is a string of two characters, _ is 2, stdin contains an empty sequence of lines.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer greater than 2. The value of `m` also remains unchanged as an integer. The value of `i` remains 2. The list `a` now contains two strings, with the second string being the input from `stdin`. The variable `first_row` is now a string of two characters, with the first character being its original value and the second character being the first character of the input string. The variable `last_row` is also a string of two characters, with the first character being its original value and the second character being the last character of the input string. The value of `_` remains 2. The `stdin` is now empty, as it has been read once.
