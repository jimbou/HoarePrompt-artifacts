Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains a sequence of lines. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). Each of the next t blocks of lines contains: a line with two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 500), followed by n lines each containing m characters 'W' and 'B'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = []
    first_row = ''
    last_row = ''
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(input())
        first_row += a[-1][0]
        last_row += a[-1][-1]
    if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
        print('NO')
    elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is greater than or equal to 0, i is n-1, m is an integer, a is a list containing n strings, first_row is a string containing n characters, last_row is a string containing n characters, _ is 0, stdin contains an empty sequence of lines. If the first string in a contains only one unique character and is not equal to the last string in a, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer, m is an integer, i is n-1, a is a list containing n strings, first_row is a string containing the first character of each input string, last_row is a string containing the last character of each input string, _ is 1, stdin contains an empty sequence of lines. If the first string in the list a contains only one unique character and is not equal to the last string in the list a, then 'NO' is printed. If the first string in the list a contains only one unique character and is not equal to the last string in the list a, and the first_row contains only one unique character, and the first_row is not equal to the last_row, then 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, either the length of the set of characters in the first string of a is not equal to 1 or the first string of a is equal to the last string of a, and 'YES' is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer, m is an integer, i is n-1, a is a list containing n strings, first_row is a string of n characters, last_row is a string of n characters, _ is 2, stdin contains an empty sequence of lines. If the first string in the list a contains only one unique character and is not equal to the last string in the list a, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
