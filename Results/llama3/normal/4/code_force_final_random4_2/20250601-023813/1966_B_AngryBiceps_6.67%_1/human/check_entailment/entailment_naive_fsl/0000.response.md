Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. It checks if the first row and the last row are the same color, and if the first column and the last column are the same color. However, this is not sufficient to determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

A counterexample is a 3x3 grid where the first and last rows are the same color, and the first and last columns are the same color, but the middle row and middle column are different colors. In this case, the program will print "YES", but it is not possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

For example, consider the following grid:

```
BBB
WBW
BBB
```

The program will print "YES", but it is not possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.
