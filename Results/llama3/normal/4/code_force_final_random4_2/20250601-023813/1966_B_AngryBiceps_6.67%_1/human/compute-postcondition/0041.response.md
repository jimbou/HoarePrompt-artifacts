Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, i is n-1, a is a list containing n strings, first_row is a string containing the first character of each input string, last_row is a string containing the last character of each input string, _ is 1, stdin contains an empty sequence of lines. If the first string in the list a contains only one unique character and is not equal to the last string in the list a, then 'NO' is printed. If the first string in the list a contains only one unique character and is not equal to the last string in the list a, and the first_row contains only one unique character, and the first_row is not equal to the last_row, then 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, either the length of the set of characters in the first string of a is not equal to 1 or the first string of a is equal to the last string of a, and 'YES' is being printed.***
