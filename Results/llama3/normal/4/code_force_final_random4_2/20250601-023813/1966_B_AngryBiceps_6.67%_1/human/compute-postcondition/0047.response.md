Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, m is an integer, i is 1, a is a list containing a single string, first_row is a single character, last_row is a single character, _ is 2, stdin contains an empty sequence of lines.**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line appends a string from stdin to the list `a`. Since stdin contains an empty sequence of lines, the string appended to `a` is an empty string. The second line adds the first character of the last element in `a` to `first_row`. Since the last element in `a` is an empty string, `first_row` remains an empty string. The third line adds the last character of the last element in `a` to `last_row`. Again, since the last element in `a` is an empty string, `last_row` also remains an empty string.

No other variables are affected by the code snippet. The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, and `_` remain unchanged. The list `a` now contains a single empty string, and `first_row` and `last_row` are still empty strings. Stdin remains empty as it was before the code execution.
