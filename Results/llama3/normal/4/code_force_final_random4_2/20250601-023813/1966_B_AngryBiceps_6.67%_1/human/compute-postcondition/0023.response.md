To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n-1`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 (the starting value of the range). Additionally, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `_` is 1, stdin contains an empty sequence of lines**
