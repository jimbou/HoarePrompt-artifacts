Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is an empty list, first_row is an empty string, last_row is an empty string, _ is 0, stdin contains a sequence of lines minus one line that was read by input()**

The first line reads a line from stdin, which contains a sequence of lines, and assigns the first two integers to `n` and `m` respectively. The second line initializes an empty list `a`. The third and fourth lines initialize empty strings `first_row` and `last_row` respectively. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. After the execution of the code, stdin contains one less line than initially, as one line was read by the `input()` function.
