The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list containing two strings, `first_row` is a string containing two characters, `last_row` is a string containing two characters, `_` is 0, stdin contains a sequence of lines minus three lines that were read by input()**
