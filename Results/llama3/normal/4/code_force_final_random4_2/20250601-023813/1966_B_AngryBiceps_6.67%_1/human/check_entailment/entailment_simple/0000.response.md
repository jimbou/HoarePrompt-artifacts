Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program checks if the first row or the first column of the grid contains only one color and if it's different from the last row or the last column, respectively. However, this is not sufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made the same color.

For example, consider a grid where the first row and the first column are all white, but the rest of the grid is black. The program would print "YES" because the first row and the first column are all the same color, but it's actually impossible to make the entire grid white because there's no way to change the color of the black squares in the middle of the grid.

A correct solution would need to check if there's a way to make all squares in the grid the same color by selecting two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them. This would require a more complex algorithm, such as a depth-first search or a breadth-first search, to explore all possible operations and check if the entire grid can be made the same color.

Correctness: **False**
