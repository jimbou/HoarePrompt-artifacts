Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, i is not defined, a is an empty list, first_row is an empty string, last_row is an empty string, _ is 2, stdin contains an empty sequence of lines
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a.append(input())
    first_row += a[-1][0]
    last_row += a[-1][-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, i is 0, a is an empty list, first\_row is an empty string, last\_row is an empty string, \_ is 2, stdin contains an empty sequence of lines.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer greater than 1, m is an integer, i is 1, a is a list containing a single string, first_row is a single character, last_row is a single character, _ is 2, stdin contains an empty sequence of lines.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than 2, m is an integer, i is 2, a is a list containing two strings, first_row is a string of two characters, last_row is a string of two characters, _ is 2, stdin contains an empty sequence of lines.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
