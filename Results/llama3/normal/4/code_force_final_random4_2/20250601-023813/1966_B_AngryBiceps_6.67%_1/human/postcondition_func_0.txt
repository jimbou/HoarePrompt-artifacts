This function reads a sequence of lines from standard input, where the first line contains an integer t, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers n and m, followed by n lines of m characters each. It then checks if the first row of characters is uniform and different from the last row, or if the first column of characters is uniform and different from the last column. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'. The function repeats this process for all test cases and leaves the standard input empty.
