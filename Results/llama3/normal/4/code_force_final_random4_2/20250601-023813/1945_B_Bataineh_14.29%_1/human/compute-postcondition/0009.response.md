Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers between 1 and 10^18, stdin contains t-1 sets of three integers a, b, and m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18). If `m` is less than `a` or `m` is less than `b`, the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, the sum of the integer division of `m` by `a`, the integer division of `m` by `b`, and 2 is printed.***
