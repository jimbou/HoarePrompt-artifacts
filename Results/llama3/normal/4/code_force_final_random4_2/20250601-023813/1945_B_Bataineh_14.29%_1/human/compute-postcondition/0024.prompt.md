Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t sets of three integers a, b, and m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
    if m < a or m < b:
        print(2)
    else:
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers between 1 and 10^18, stdin contains t-1 sets of three integers a, b, and m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18). If `m` is less than `a` or `m` is less than `b`, the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, the sum of the integer division of `m` by `a`, the integer division of `m` by `b`, and 2 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers between 1 and 10^18 and are the first set of three integers from the input, stdin contains t-3 sets of three integers a, b, and m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18). If `m` is less than `a` or `m` is less than `b`, the number 2 is being printed. Otherwise, the value of the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` is being printed, where `m // a` is the integer division of `m` by `a`, `m // b` is the integer division of `m` by `b`, and 2 is an integer constant.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers between 1 and 10^18 and are the third set of three integers from the input, stdin contains t-4 sets of three integers a, b, and m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18). If `m` is less than `a` or `m` is less than `b`, the number 2 is being printed. Otherwise, the value of the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` is being printed, where `m // a` is the integer division of `m` by `a`, `m // b` is the integer division of `m` by `b`, and 2 is an integer constant.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
