The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers between 1 and 10^18, stdin contains t-2 sets of three integers a, b, and m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18)**
