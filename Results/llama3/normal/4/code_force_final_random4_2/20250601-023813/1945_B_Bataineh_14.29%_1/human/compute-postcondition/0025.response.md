Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers a, b, and m. For each test case, it prints the minimum number of operations required to make a and b greater than or equal to m. If m is less than either a or b, it prints 2. Otherwise, it prints the sum of the integer divisions of m by a and b, plus 2. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.**
