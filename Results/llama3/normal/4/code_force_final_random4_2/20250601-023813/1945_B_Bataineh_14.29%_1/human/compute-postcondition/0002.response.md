Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers between 1 and 10^18, stdin contains t-1 sets of three integers a, b, and m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18)**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `a`, `b`, and `m` are assigned the values of the first set of three integers from the input, which are between 1 and 10^18. The stdin now contains t-1 sets of three integers a, b, and m, as one set has been consumed by the input operation.
