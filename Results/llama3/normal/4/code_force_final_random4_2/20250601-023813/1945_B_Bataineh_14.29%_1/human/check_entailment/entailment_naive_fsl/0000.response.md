Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. 

The issue lies in the line where it prints the result. The correct calculation should be `print(m // a + m // b + 2)` when both `a` and `b` are less than or equal to `m`, and `print(2)` when either `a` or `b` is greater than `m`. However, the current program prints `print(m // a + m // b + 2)` when both `a` and `b` are greater than or equal to `m`, which is incorrect.

For example, when `a = 10`, `b = 10`, and `m = 5`, the program will print `2` because `m < a` and `m < b`, but the correct answer is `3` because one firework from each installation will be visible in the sky at the same time, and there will be one more firework visible from the previous launch of one of the installations.

The correct code should be:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if m < a and m < b:
            print(2)
        else:
            print(m // a + m // b + 2)
```

This code correctly handles the case when both `a` and `b` are greater than `m`, and when either `a` or `b` is greater than `m`.
