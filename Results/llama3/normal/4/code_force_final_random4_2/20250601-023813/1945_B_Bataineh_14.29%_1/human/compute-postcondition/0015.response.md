Output: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers between 1 and 10^18 and are the first set of three integers from the input, stdin contains t-3 sets of three integers a, b, and m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), and the value of the expression m // a + m // b + 2 is being printed, where m // a is the integer division of m by a, m // b is the integer division of m by b, and 2 is an integer constant.**
