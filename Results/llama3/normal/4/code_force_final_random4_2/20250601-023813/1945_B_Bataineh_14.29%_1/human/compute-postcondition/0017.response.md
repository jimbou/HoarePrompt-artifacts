The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `t` remains the same. So `i` is 2 and `t` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^4.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers between 1 and 10^18 and are the second set of three integers from the input, stdin contains t-3 sets of three integers a, b, and m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18). If `m` is less than `a` or `m` is less than `b`, the number 2 is being printed. Otherwise, the value of the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` is being printed, where `m // a` is the integer division of `m` by `a`, `m // b` is the integer division of `m` by `b`, and 2 is an integer constant.**
