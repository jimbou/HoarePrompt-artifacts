Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is `t-1`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers between 1 and 10^18 and are the last set of three integers from the input, stdin is empty. If `m` is less than `a` or `m` is less than `b`, the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, the value of the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` is printed, where `m // a` is the integer division of `m` by `a`, `m // b` is the integer division of `m` by `b`, and 2 is an integer constant.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `t-1`, which is the last index of the input sets. The variables `a`, `b`, and `m` will hold the values of the last set of three integers from the input. The standard input (stdin) will be empty, as all input sets have been processed. The output will be either the number 2, if `m` is less than `a` or `b`, or the result of the expression `m // a + m // b + 2`, which calculates the sum of the integer divisions of `m` by `a` and `b`, plus 2.
