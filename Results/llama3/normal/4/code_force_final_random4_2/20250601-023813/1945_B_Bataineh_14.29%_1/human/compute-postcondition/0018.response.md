Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers between 1 and 10^18 and are the third set of three integers from the input, stdin contains t-4 sets of three integers a, b, and m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18). If `m` is less than `a` or `m` is less than `b`, the number 2 is being printed. Otherwise, the value of the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` is being printed, where `m // a` is the integer division of `m` by `a`, `m // b` is the integer division of `m` by `b`, and 2 is an integer constant.**

In natural language, the output state is: the value of `t` remains the same, the value of `i` remains the same, the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to the third set of three integers from the input, and the stdin contains t-4 sets of three integers a, b, and m. The conditions for printing the number 2 or the value of the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` are still valid.
