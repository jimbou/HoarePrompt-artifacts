Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive), l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, and mi is not defined.**

The code first decrements T by 1, so T is now between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive). Then, it reads two integers from input and assigns them to n and k, respectively. The value of n is now an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and k is an integer. The code then reads a list of n integers from input and assigns them to a, so a is now a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive). The variables l and r are set to 0 and n - 1, respectively. The variable ans is set to 0. The variable mi is not defined in the code, so its value is not updated.
