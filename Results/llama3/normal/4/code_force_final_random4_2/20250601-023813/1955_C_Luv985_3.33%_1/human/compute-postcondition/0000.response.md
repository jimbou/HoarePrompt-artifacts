Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^15). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

The code reads an integer T from stdin, which represents the number of test cases. The value of T is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). After reading T, there are t-1 test cases left in stdin. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The values of n, k, and a_i are within their respective ranges as specified in the initial state.
