Postcondition: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to its original value minus 2 * mi, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive) where a[0] is less than or equal to its original value minus mi and a[n-1] is less than or equal to its original value minus mi, if a[0] is 0, then the current value of l is 1, the current value of r is n - 1, the current value of ans is 1, and the current value of mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] after the subtraction of mi from a[0] and a[n-1]. Otherwise, the values of l, r, ans, and mi remain unchanged. Additionally, the current value of a[r] is 0.**
