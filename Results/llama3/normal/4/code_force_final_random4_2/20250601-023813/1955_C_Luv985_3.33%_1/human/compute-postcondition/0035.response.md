Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and T is greater than 0, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 10^15 (inclusive) and k is updated to its original value minus 2 times the minimum of a[l] and a[r], a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and a[l] and a[r] are updated to their original values minus the minimum of a[l] and a[r], l is either 1 or 2 and l is less than r, if l is 1 then r is n - 1, otherwise r is either n - 1 or n - 2, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], ans is either 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `l` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `k` is still between 1 and 10^15 (inclusive), and the value of `a[l]` and `a[r]` are still between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The value of `mi` is still the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`.
