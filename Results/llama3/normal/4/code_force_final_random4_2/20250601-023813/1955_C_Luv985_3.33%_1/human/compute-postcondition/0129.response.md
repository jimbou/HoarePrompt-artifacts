Postcondition: ***T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer greater than 0, l is less than r, and mi is the minimum value between a[l] and a[r]. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then a[l] and a[r] are less than or equal to their original values. If a[l] is 0, ans is incremented by 1 and l is incremented by 1. If a[r] is 0, ans is incremented by 1 and r is decremented by 1. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then if mi - t - k // 2 equals 0, ans is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
