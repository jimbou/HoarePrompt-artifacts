Output State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and `T` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^15 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `l` is either 0 or 1, if `l` is 1 then `r` is `n - 1`, otherwise `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is either 1, 2 or 3, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `t` is either 0 or 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
