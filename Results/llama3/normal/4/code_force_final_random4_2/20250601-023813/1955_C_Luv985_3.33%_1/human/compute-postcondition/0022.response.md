Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and T is greater than 0, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 10^15 (inclusive) and is equal to its original value minus 2 times the minimum of a[l] and a[r], a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) where a[l] and a[r] are equal to their original values minus the minimum of a[l] and a[r], l is either 0 or 1, if l is 1 then r is n - 1, otherwise r is either n - 1 or n - 2, ans is either 0, 1 or 2, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r] after subtracting the minimum of a[l] and a[r] from a[l] and a[r].**

In this output state, the values of T, n, l, r, and ans remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of k is reduced by twice the minimum of a[l] and a[r], which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The list a is modified such that the elements at indices l and r are reduced by the minimum of a[l] and a[r]. The value of mi is updated to be the minimum of the modified a[l] and a[r].
