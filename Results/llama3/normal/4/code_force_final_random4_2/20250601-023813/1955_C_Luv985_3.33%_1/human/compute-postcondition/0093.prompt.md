Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer between 0 and 10^15 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive), l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, and stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `k` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^15 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive), `l` and `r` are integers, `ans` is an integer, and `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. If `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is reduced by `2 * mi`, `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are reduced by `mi`, and if `a[0]` is 0, then `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 2, and `a[l]` is `a[1]`. Otherwise, `l`, `r`, `ans`, and `a[l]` remain unchanged, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 2, and `a[r]` is 0. If `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, then `ans` is 1 if `mi - t - k / 2` equals 0, where `t` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `k` is even or odd, and `ans` remains 0 otherwise.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is greater than 2 * mi, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive) with a[0] and a[n-1] potentially reduced, l is less than r, r is n - 2, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], ans is an integer. If mi * 2 <= k, then if a[r] is equal to 0, r is updated to n - 3, and if a[l] is equal to 0, ans is updated to its original value plus 2, and l is updated to its original value plus 1. Otherwise, the values of ans, l, and r remain unchanged. If mi * 2 > k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is greater than 0, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive) with a[0] and a[n-1] potentially reduced, l is less than n - 2, r is n - 2, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], ans is an integer. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is reduced by twice the minimum of a[l] and a[r], a is updated by reducing a[l] and a[r] by the minimum of their original values, if a[r] is 0, then l is less than n - 1, r is n - 3, mi is the minimum of the original a[l] and a[r], and ans is an integer greater than its original value by 1. Otherwise, the values of l, r, mi, and ans remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
