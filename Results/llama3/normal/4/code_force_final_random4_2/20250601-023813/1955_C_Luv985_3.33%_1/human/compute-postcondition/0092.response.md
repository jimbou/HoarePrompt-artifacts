Postcondition: ***T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is greater than 0, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive) with a[0] and a[n-1] potentially reduced, l is less than n - 2, r is n - 2, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], ans is an integer. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is reduced by twice the minimum of a[l] and a[r], a is updated by reducing a[l] and a[r] by the minimum of their original values, if a[r] is 0, then l is less than n - 1, r is n - 3, mi is the minimum of the original a[l] and a[r], and ans is an integer greater than its original value by 1. Otherwise, the values of l, r, mi, and ans remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
