Output State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and `T` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^15 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `l` is either 0 or 1 and `l` is less than `r`, if `l` is 1 then `r` is `n - 1`, otherwise `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, if `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is updated to its original value minus 2 times the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a[l]` and `a[r]` are updated to their original values minus the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and if `a[l]` is 0, `ans` is either 2, 3 or 4, if `a[r]` is 0, `ans` is either 3, 4 or 5, otherwise `ans` is either 1, 2 or 3. If `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, then if `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0, then `ans` is either 2, 3 or 4, otherwise `ans` is either 1, 2 or 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `t` is either 0 or 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `mi * 2` being less than or equal to `k` or greater than `k` still apply, and the corresponding updates to `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, and `ans` are still valid. The value of `t` is still either 0 or 1.
