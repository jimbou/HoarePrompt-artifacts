Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^15). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
while T:
    T -= 1
    n, k = input().split()
    n = int(n)
    k = int(k)
    a = input().split()
    a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    ans = 0
    while l < r and k > 0:
        mi = min(a[l], a[r])
        if mi * 2 <= k:
            a[l] -= mi
            a[r] -= mi
            k -= mi * 2
            if a[l] == 0:
                ans += 1
                l += 1
            if a[r] == 0:
                ans += 1
                r -= 1
        else:
            t = k % 2
            if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
                ans += 1
            break
    if l == r:
        ans += k >= a[l]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer between 0 and 10^15 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive), l is an integer between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), r is an integer between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), and ans is an integer between 0 and n (inclusive) and is equal to the previous value of ans plus 1 if k is greater than or equal to a[l], otherwise it is equal to the previous value of ans, and the value of ans is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is 0, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive) with a[0] and a[n-1] potentially reduced, l is an integer less than or equal to n - 1, r is an integer less than or equal to n - 1, ans is an integer, and mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r]. If l is equal to r, then ans is increased by 1 if k is greater than or equal to a[l] (which is equal to mi), and the value of ans is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, l is less than or equal to r, mi is the minimum value between a[l] and a[r], and the values of a[l], a[r], t are unchanged. If l is equal to r, then if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, ans is incremented by 1 and r is decremented by 1 if a[r] is equal to 0. If mi * 2 is greater than k, ans is incremented by 1 if mi - t - k // 2 equals 0, otherwise ans remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, ans is incremented by 1 if k is greater than or equal to a[l]. If l is not equal to r, the values of ans, l, and r remain unchanged. The value of ans is being printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
