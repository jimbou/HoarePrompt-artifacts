Output State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `k` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^15 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive), `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `t` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `k` is even or odd, and the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` multiplied by 2 is greater than `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `ans`, and `mi` remain the same as in the initial state. A new variable `t` is introduced, which is assigned the value of `k` modulo 2, meaning it will be 0 if `k` is even and 1 if `k` is odd. The condition that the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` multiplied by 2 is greater than `k` still holds.
