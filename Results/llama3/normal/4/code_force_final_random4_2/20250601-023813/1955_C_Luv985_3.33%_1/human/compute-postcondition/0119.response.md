Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer greater than 0, l is less than r, and mi is the minimum value between a[l] and a[r].**

In this output state, the values of T, n, k, l, and r remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The code only introduced a new variable mi, which is assigned the minimum value between a[l] and a[r]. The relationship between l and r also remains the same, with l being less than r.
