Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer greater than 0, l is less than r, a[l] is decreased by mi, a[r] is decreased by mi, mi is the minimum value between the new a[l] and the new a[r], ans is unchanged, t is unchanged.**

In this output state, the values of `T`, `n`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `k` is decreased by twice the value of `mi`, which is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. The values of `a[l]` and `a[r]` are both decreased by `mi`. The value of `mi` is updated to be the minimum value between the new `a[l]` and the new `a[r]`. The relationship between `l` and `r` remains the same, with `l` being less than `r`.
