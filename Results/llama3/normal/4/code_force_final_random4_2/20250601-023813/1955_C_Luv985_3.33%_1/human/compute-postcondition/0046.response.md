Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer between 0 and 10^15 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive), l is an integer between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), r is an integer between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive) and is equal to l, ans is an integer between 0 and n (inclusive) and is equal to the previous value of ans plus 1 if k is greater than or equal to a[l], otherwise it is equal to the previous value of ans.**

In natural language, the output state is: T, n, k, a, l, and r remain unchanged. The value of ans is incremented by 1 if k is greater than or equal to the value of a at index l, otherwise it remains the same.
