Postcondition: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer greater than 0. If a[r] is equal to 0, then ans is incremented by 1, r is decremented by 1, and the values of l, a[l], a[r], mi, and t remain unchanged. Otherwise, T, n, k, l, r, a[l], a[r], mi, ans, and t remain unchanged.**
