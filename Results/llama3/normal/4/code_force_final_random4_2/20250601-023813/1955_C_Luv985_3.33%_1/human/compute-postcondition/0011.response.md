Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and T is greater than 0, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 10^15 (inclusive) and k is equal to its original value minus 2 times mi, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) where a[0] is equal to its original value minus mi and a[n-1] is equal to its original value minus mi, if a[l] is 0, then l is 1, r is n - 2, ans is 2, otherwise l is 0, r is n - 2, ans is 1, mi is the minimum of a[0] - mi and a[n-1] - mi, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^15). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The current value of mi is such that mi * 2 is less than or equal to k. The current value of a[r] is not 0.**

The code increments the value of `ans` by 1 and decrements the value of `r` by 1. The value of `ans` is now either 1 or 2, depending on the original value of `a[l]`. The value of `r` is now `n - 2`. The value of `a[r]` is no longer 0. The values of `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `mi` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-2` test cases.
