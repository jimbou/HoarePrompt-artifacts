Postcondition: ***T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and T is greater than 0, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 10^15 (inclusive) and k is updated to its original value minus 2 times the minimum of a[l] and a[r], a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and a[l] and a[r] are updated to their original values minus the minimum of a[l] and a[r], l is either 0 or 1 and l is less than r, if l is 1 then r is n - 1, otherwise r is either n - 1 or n - 2, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], ans is either 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4. If a[l] is 0, then l is either 1 or 2 and l is less than r, if l is 1 then r is n - 1, otherwise r is either n - 1 or n - 2, ans is either 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.***
