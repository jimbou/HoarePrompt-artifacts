Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and T is greater than 0, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 10^15 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 1 if the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] minus t minus k divided by 2 equals 0, otherwise ans is 0, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], t is either 0 or 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^15). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] is more than k/2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values and ranges, except for the number of test cases in stdin, which decreases by 1. The break statement only affects the control flow, exiting the innermost loop or if statement, but does not modify any variable values.
