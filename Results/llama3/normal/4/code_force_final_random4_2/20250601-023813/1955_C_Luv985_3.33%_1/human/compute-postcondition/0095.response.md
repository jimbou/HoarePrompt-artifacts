Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is 0, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive) with a[0] and a[n-1] potentially reduced, l is an integer equal to r, and equal to or less than n - 1, r is an integer equal to l, and equal to or less than n - 1, ans is an integer and is increased by 1 if k is greater than or equal to a[l] (which is equal to mi), and mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], which are equal.**

In natural language, the output state is: T is still an integer between 0 and 10^4, n is still an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, k is still 0, a is still a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 with a[0] and a[n-1] potentially reduced, l and r are still equal and less than or equal to n - 1, ans is increased by 1 if k is greater than or equal to a[l] (which is equal to mi), and mi is still the minimum of a[l] and a[r], which are equal.
