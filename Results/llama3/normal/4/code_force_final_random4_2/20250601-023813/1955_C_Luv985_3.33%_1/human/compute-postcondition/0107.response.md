Postcondition: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to its original value minus 2 * mi, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive) where a[0] is less than or equal to its original value minus mi and a[n-1] is less than or equal to its original value minus mi, if a[0] is 0, then l is 1, r is n - 1, ans is 1, and mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] after the subtraction of mi from a[0] and a[n-1]. Otherwise, the values of l, r, ans, and mi remain unchanged.**
