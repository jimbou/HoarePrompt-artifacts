Postcondition: ***T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is greater than 2 * mi, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive) with a[0] and a[n-1] potentially reduced, l is less than r, r is n - 2, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], ans is an integer. If mi * 2 <= k, then if a[r] is equal to 0, r is updated to n - 3, and if a[l] is equal to 0, ans is updated to its original value plus 2, and l is updated to its original value plus 1. Otherwise, the values of ans, l, and r remain unchanged. If mi * 2 > k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
