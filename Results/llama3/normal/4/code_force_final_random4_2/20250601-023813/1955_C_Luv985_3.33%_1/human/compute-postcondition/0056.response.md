Postcondition: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^15 (inclusive) and is equal to its original value minus 2 times the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive) where a[0] and a[n-1] are both reduced by the minimum of their original values, l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] after the reduction, and stdin contains no input. The current value of a[l] is 0.**
