Postcondition: ***T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is 0, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive) with a[0] and a[n-1] potentially reduced, l is an integer less than or equal to n - 1, r is an integer less than or equal to n - 1, ans is an integer, and mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r]. If l is equal to r, then ans is increased by 1 if k is greater than or equal to a[l] (which is equal to mi).***
