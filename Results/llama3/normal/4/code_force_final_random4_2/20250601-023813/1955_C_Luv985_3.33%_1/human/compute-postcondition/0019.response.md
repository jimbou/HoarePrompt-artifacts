Postcondition: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and T is greater than 0, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 10^15 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), l is either 0 or 1, r is either n - 1 or n - 2, ans is either 0, 1 or 2. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is equal to its original value minus 2 times mi, a[0] is equal to its original value minus mi and a[n-1] is equal to its original value minus mi. If a[l] is 0, then l is 1, r is n - 1, ans is 1, otherwise l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0. If a[r] is 0, then l is 1, r is n - 2, ans is 2, otherwise l is 0, r is n - 2, ans is 1. If mi * 2 is more than k, then ans is 1 if the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] minus t minus k divided by 2 equals 0, otherwise ans is 0.**
