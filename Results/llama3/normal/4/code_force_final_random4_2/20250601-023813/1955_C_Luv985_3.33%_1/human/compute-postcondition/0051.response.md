Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer between 0 and 10^15 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive), l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, and stdin contains no input.**

The code block modifies the initial state in the following ways:

- The first line decrements T by 1, so T becomes an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive).

- The second line reads two space-separated integers from stdin and assigns them to n and k, respectively. Since stdin is empty after this operation, it is not included in the output state. n becomes an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and k becomes an integer between 0 and 10^15 (inclusive).

- The third line reads a space-separated list of integers from stdin, assigns it to a, and converts the list to integers. Since stdin is empty after this operation, it is not included in the output state. a becomes a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive).

- The fourth and fifth lines assign 0 to l and n - 1 to r, respectively.

- The sixth line assigns 0 to ans.

- The seventh line prints the value of ans, which is 0.

No other variables are affected by the code block.
