Postcondition: ***T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is greater than 0 and reduced by twice the minimum of a[l] and a[r], a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive) with a[l] and a[r] reduced by the minimum of their original values, if a[r] is 0, then l is less than n - 1, r is n - 3, mi is the minimum of the original a[l] and a[r], and ans is an integer greater than its original value by 1. Otherwise, the values of l, r, mi, and ans remain unchanged.***
