Output State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `k` is greater than `2 * mi`, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive) with `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` potentially reduced, `l` is less than `r`, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is an integer and is increased by 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and `t` is 0 if `k` is even and 1 if `k` is odd.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
