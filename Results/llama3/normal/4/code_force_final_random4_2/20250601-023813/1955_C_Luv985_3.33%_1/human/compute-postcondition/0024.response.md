Postcondition: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and T is greater than 0, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 10^15 (inclusive) and is equal to its original value minus 2 times the minimum of a[l] and a[r], a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) where a[l] and a[r] are equal to their original values minus the minimum of a[l] and a[r], l is either 0 or 1, if l is 1 then r is n - 1, otherwise r is either n - 1 or n - 2, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r] after subtracting the minimum of a[l] and a[r] from a[l] and a[r]. If a[l] is 0, ans is either 1, 2 or 3. Otherwise, ans is either 0, 1 or 2.**
