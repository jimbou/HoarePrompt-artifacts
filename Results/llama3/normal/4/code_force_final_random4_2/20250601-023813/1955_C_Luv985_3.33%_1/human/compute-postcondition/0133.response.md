Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer greater than 0, l is less than or equal to r, a[l] is decreased by mi, a[r] is decreased by mi, mi is the minimum value between the new a[l] and the new a[r], ans is incremented by 1, t is unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `l` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `l` and `r` has been updated to reflect that `l` is now less than or equal to `r`, as `l` has been incremented.
