Postcondition: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive), l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], and t is either 0 or 1. The current value of mi minus t minus k divided by 2 equals 0.**
