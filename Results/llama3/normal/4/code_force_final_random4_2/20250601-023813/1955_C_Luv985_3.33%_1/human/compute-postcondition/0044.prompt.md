Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and T is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 10^15 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^15). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and T is greater than 0, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 10^15 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), l is either 0 or 1, r is either n - 1 or n - 2, ans is either 0, 1 or 2. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is equal to its original value minus 2 times mi, a[0] is equal to its original value minus mi and a[n-1] is equal to its original value minus mi. If a[l] is 0, then l is 1, r is n - 1, ans is 1, otherwise l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0. If a[r] is 0, then l is 1, r is n - 2, ans is 2, otherwise l is 0, r is n - 2, ans is 1. If mi * 2 is more than k, then ans is 1 if the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] minus t minus k divided by 2 equals 0, otherwise ans is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and T is greater than 0, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 10^15 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), l is either 0 or 1, if l is 1 then r is n - 1, otherwise r is either n - 1 or n - 2, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r]. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is updated to its original value minus 2 times the minimum of a[l] and a[r], a[l] and a[r] are updated to their original values minus the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and if a[l] is 0, ans is either 1, 2 or 3, if a[r] is 0, ans is either 2, 3 or 4, otherwise ans is either 0, 1 or 2. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then if mi - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is either 1, 2 or 3, otherwise ans is either 0, 1 or 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and T is greater than 0, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 10^15 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), l is either 0 or 1 and l is less than r, if l is 1 then r is n - 1, otherwise r is either n - 1 or n - 2, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r]. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is updated to its original value minus 2 times the minimum of a[l] and a[r], a[l] and a[r] are updated to their original values minus the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and if a[l] is 0, ans is either 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, if a[r] is 0, ans is either 2, 3, 4 or 5, otherwise ans is either 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then if mi - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, otherwise ans is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
