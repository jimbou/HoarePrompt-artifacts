Postcondition: **`T` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `k` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^15 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive), `l` and `r` are integers, `ans` is an integer, and `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. If `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is reduced by `2 * mi`, `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are reduced by `mi`, and if `a[0]` is 0, then `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 2, and `a[l]` is `a[1]`. Otherwise, `l`, `r`, `ans`, and `a[l]` remain unchanged, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 2, and `a[r]` is 0. If `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, then `ans` is 1 if `mi - t - k / 2` equals 0, where `t` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `k` is even or odd, and `ans` remains 0 otherwise.**
