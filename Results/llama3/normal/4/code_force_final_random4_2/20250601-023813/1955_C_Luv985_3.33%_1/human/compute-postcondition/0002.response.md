Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and T is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 10^15 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^15). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

Explanation: The code snippet processes one test case from the input. It first decrements the value of T by 1. Then, it reads the values of n and k from the input and converts them to integers. It also reads a list of n integers from the input and stores them in the list a. The variables l, r, and ans are initialized to 0, n - 1, and 0, respectively. The stdin now contains t-2 test cases.
