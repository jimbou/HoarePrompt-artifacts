Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, l is less than r, a[l] is less than or equal to its original value, a[r] is less than or equal to its original value, mi is the minimum value between the new values of a[l] and a[r], ans is incremented by 1, and l is incremented by 1.**

In this final state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `l` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their original values and relationships as specified in the initial state.
