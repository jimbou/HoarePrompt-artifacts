Postcondition: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer greater than 0. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is decreased by 2 * mi, a[0] and a[n-1] are decreased by mi. If a[r] is 0, then l is 1 if a[0] is 0, otherwise its value remains unchanged, r is n - 2, ans is 2. If a[r] is not 0, then the values of l, r, ans, and mi remain unchanged. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then if mi minus t minus k divided by 2 equals 0, then ans is 1. Otherwise, ans remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
