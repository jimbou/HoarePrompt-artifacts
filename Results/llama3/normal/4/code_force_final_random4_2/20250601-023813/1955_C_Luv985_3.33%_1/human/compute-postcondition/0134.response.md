Postcondition: ***T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer greater than 0. If a[l] is equal to 0, then l is less than or equal to r, a[l] is decreased by mi, a[r] is decreased by mi, mi is the minimum value between the new a[l] and the new a[r], ans is incremented by 1, and t is unchanged. Otherwise, T, n, k, l, r, a[l], a[r], mi, ans, and t remain unchanged.***
