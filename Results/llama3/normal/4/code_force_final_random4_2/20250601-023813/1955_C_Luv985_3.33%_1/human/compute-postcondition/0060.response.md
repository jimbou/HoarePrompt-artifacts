Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^15 (inclusive) and is equal to its original value minus 2 times the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive) where a[0] and a[n-1] are both reduced by the minimum of their original values, l is 1 if a[0] is 0, otherwise no change, r is n - 2, ans is 2 if a[0] is 0, otherwise 2, and a[l] is a[1] if a[0] is 0, otherwise no change, and a[r] is 0.**
