Output: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, l is less than or equal to r, mi is the minimum value between a[l] and a[r], and the values of a[l], a[r], t are unchanged. If l is equal to r, then if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, ans is incremented by 1 and r is decremented by 1 if a[r] is equal to 0. If mi * 2 is greater than k, ans is incremented by 1 if mi - t - k // 2 equals 0, otherwise ans remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, ans is incremented by 1 if k is greater than or equal to a[l]. If l is not equal to r, the values of ans, l, and r remain unchanged. The value of ans is being printed.**
