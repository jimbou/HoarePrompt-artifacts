Postcondition: **`T` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `k` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is less than `r`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and the values of `a[l]`, `a[r]`, `t` are unchanged. If `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, then if `a[r]` is equal to 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 and `r` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, all variables remain unchanged. If `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, then if `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0, `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
