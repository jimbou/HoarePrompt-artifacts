Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to its original value minus 2 * mi, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive) where a[0] is less than or equal to its original value minus mi and a[n-1] is less than or equal to its original value minus mi, l is 1 if a[0] is 0, otherwise its value remains unchanged, r is n - 2, ans is 2, and mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] after the subtraction of mi from a[0] and a[n-1].**
