Output State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `k` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is less than `r`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `t` is either 0 or 1, and `ans` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, all the initial conditions remain the same, except for the value of `ans`, which has been incremented by 1. The other variables, such as `T`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `r`, `mi`, and `t`, retain their original values and properties.
