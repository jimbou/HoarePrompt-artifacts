Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and T is greater than 0, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 10^15 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), l is either 0 or 1, if l is 1 then r is n - 1, otherwise r is either n - 1 or n - 2, if mi - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is either 1, 2 or 3, otherwise ans is either 0, 1 or 2, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], t is either 0 or 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables T, n, k, a, l, r, mi, t, and ans remain the same as in the initial state.
