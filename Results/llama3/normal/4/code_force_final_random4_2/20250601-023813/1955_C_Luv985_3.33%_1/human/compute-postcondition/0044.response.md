Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and T is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer between 0 and 10^15 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive), l is an integer between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), r is an integer between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), ans is an integer between 0 and n (inclusive).**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of T remains unchanged, the value of n remains unchanged, the value of k is updated to be between 0 and 10^15 (inclusive), the value of a is updated to be a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive), the value of l is updated to be an integer between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), the value of r is updated to be an integer between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), and the value of ans is updated to be an integer between 0 and n (inclusive).
