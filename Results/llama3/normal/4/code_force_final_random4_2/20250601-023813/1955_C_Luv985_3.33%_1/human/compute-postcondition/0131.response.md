Output State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `k` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is less than `r`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and the values of `ans`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, `t` are unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `mi` is updated to be the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
