Postcondition: ***T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^15 (inclusive) and is equal to its original value minus 2 times the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive) where a[0] and a[n-1] are both reduced by the minimum of their original values. If a[0] is 0, then l is 1, r is n - 2, ans is 2, and the current value of a[l] is a[1]. Otherwise, no changes are made to l, r, ans, and a[l], and r is n - 2, ans is 2, and a[r] is 0.***
