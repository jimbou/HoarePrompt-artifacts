Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and T is greater than 0, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 10^15 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), l is either 0 or 1, if l is 1 then r is n - 1, otherwise r is either n - 1 or n - 2, ans is either 0, 1 or 2, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r].**

In natural language, the output state is: T is a positive integer between 0 and 10^4, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^15, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, l is either 0 or 1, if l is 1 then r is n - 1, otherwise r is either n - 1 or n - 2, ans is either 0, 1 or 2, and mi is the minimum of the integers at index l and r in the list a.
