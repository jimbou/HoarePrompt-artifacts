Output State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `k` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is less than `r`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `ans` is incremented by 1, `a[l]` is unchanged, `a[r]` is unchanged, and `t` is either 0 or 1, depending on whether `k` is even or odd.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The range and relationships between the variables are still the same as in the initial state.
