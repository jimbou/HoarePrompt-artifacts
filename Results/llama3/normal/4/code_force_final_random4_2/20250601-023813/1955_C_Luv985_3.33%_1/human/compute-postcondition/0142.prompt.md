Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive), l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, and mi is not defined.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer greater than 0. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is decreased by 2 * mi, a[0] and a[n-1] are decreased by mi. If a[r] is 0, then l is 1 if a[0] is 0, otherwise its value remains unchanged, r is n - 2, ans is 2. If a[r] is not 0, then the values of l, r, ans, and mi remain unchanged. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then if mi minus t minus k divided by 2 equals 0, then ans is 1. Otherwise, ans remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer greater than 0, l is less than r, and mi is the minimum value between a[l] and a[r]. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then a[l] and a[r] are less than or equal to their original values. If a[l] is 0, ans is incremented by 1 and l is incremented by 1. If a[r] is 0, ans is incremented by 1 and r is decremented by 1. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then if mi - t - k // 2 equals 0, ans is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `T` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `k` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is less than `r`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and the values of `a[l]`, `a[r]`, `t` are unchanged. If `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, then if `a[r]` is equal to 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 and `r` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, all variables remain unchanged. If `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, then if `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0, `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
