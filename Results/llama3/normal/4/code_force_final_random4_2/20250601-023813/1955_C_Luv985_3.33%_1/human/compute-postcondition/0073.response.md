Postcondition: ***T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is greater than 2 * mi - 2 * mi, a is a list of n integers between -mi and 10^9 (inclusive) with a[0] and a[n-1] potentially reduced, l is less than r, r is n - 2, and mi is the minimum of a[l] - mi and a[r] - mi. If a[l] is equal to 0, then ans is an integer equal to its original value plus 1, and l is equal to its original value plus 1. Otherwise, the values of ans and l remain unchanged.***
