The only variable in the loop head is variable T, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable T.  If T is greater than 0, the loop can execute . Rigtht before the loop, T is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), So for the loop to  executed the first time T must be greater than 0.
State: **T is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and T must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^15). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**
