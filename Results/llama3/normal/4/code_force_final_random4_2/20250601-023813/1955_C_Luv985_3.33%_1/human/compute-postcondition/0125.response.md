Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer greater than 0, l is less than r, mi is the minimum value between a[l] and a[r], and t is either 0 or 1.**

In this output state, the value of t is determined by the remainder of k divided by 2, which can be either 0 or 1. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial conditions.
