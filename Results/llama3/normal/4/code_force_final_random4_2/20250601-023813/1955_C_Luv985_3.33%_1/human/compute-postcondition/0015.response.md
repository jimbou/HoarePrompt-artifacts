Postcondition: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and T is greater than 0, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 10^15 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], t is either 0 or 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^15). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] is more than k/2. The current value of mi minus t minus k divided by 2 equals 0.**
