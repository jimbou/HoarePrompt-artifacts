Output State: **removals is a non-negative integer that must be at least 2, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, i is 2, s is reduced by elements[-2], s2 is reduced by elements[-2] and then increased by elements[-(negatives + 2)].**

In this output state, the value of s2 has been updated by adding elements[-(negatives + 2)] to its previous value, which was reduced by elements[-2]. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
