Postcondition: ***removals is a non-negative integer that must be at least 2, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, i is 2, s is reduced by elements[-2], s2 is reduced by elements[-2]. If the sum of negatives and i is less than or equal to the length of elements, s2 is increased by elements[-(negatives + 2)].***
