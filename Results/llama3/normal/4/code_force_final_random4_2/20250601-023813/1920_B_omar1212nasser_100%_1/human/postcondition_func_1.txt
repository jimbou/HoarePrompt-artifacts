This function calculates and returns the maximum value from a list of sums, where each sum is calculated by subtracting twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' from the sum of all elements in the list 'elements', and then iteratively subtracting the last 'removals' elements and adding the element at index -(negatives + i) for i from 1 to removals. The function takes three parameters: 'removals' and 'negatives' as non-negative integers, and 'elements' as a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order. The function returns the maximum value from the calculated list of sums.
