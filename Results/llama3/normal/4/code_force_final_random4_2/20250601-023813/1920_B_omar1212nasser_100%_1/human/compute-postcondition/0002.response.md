Output State: **removals is a non-negative integer that must be at least 1, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, pos is a list containing one element which is the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements', s is the sum of all elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element, s2 is the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element, i is 1**

In this output state, the values of `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements` remain unchanged. The value of `pos` is still the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements', but since `s` and `s2` have been updated, the value of `pos` is now calculated using the updated values of `s` and `s2`. The value of `s` is now the sum of all elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element, and the value of `s2` is now the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1.
