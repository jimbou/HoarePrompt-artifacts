Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: removals is a non-negative integer, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, pos is a list containing one element which is the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements', s is the sum of all elements in the list 'elements', s2 is the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, removals + 1):
    s -= elements[-i]
    s2 -= elements[-i]
    if negatives + i <= len(elements):
        s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]
    pos.append(s - 2 * s2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `removals` is a non-negative integer that must be at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, `pos` is a list containing two elements: the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements', and the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element plus the element at index -(negatives + i), `s` is the sum of all elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element, `s2` is the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element plus the element at index -(negatives + i), and `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: removals is a non-negative integer that must be at least 2, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order. If negatives + i is less than or equal to the length of elements, then pos is a list containing three elements: the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements', the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element plus the element at index -(negatives + i), and the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element plus the element at index -(negatives + i) minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element plus the element at index -(negatives + i), s is the sum of all elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element minus the element at index -(negatives + i), and s2 is the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element plus the element at index -(negatives + i) minus the element at index -(negatives + i) plus the element at index -(negatives + i). Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `removals` is a non-negative integer that must be at least 2, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, `i` is 2, `s` is reduced by `elements[-2]`, `s2` is reduced by `elements[-2]`, `pos` is increased by `s - 2 * s2`. If the sum of `negatives` and `i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `s2` is increased by `elements[-(negatives + 2)]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
