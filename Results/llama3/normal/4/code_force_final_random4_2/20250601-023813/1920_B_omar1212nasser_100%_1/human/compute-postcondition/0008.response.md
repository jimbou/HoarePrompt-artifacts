Output State: **removals is a non-negative integer that must be at least 2, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, pos is a list containing two elements: the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements', and the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element plus the element at index -(negatives + i), s is the sum of all elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element minus the element at index -(negatives + i), s2 is the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element plus the element at index -(negatives + i) minus the element at index -(negatives + i), and i is 2**

The code snippet modifies the values of `s` and `s2` by subtracting the element at index `-i` from both variables. Since `i` is 2, the element at index `-2` is subtracted from `s` and `s2`. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, `pos`, and `i` remain unchanged.
