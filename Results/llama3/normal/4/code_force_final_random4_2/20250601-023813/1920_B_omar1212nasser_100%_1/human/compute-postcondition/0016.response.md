Output State: **`removals` is a non-negative integer that must be at least 2, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, `i` is 2, `s` is reduced by `elements[-2]`, `s2` is reduced by `elements[-2]`, `pos` is increased by `s - 2 * s2`. If the sum of `negatives` and `i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `s2` is increased by `elements[-(negatives + 2)]`.**

In this output state, the value of `pos` has been updated by appending the result of the expression `s - 2 * s2`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The condition regarding the sum of `negatives` and `i` and its relation to the length of `elements` still applies to `s2`.
