The function accepts a list of non-negative integers and two non-negative integers k and x, such that 1 <= k <= n and 1 <= x <= n, where n is the length of the list. It sorts the list in ascending order and then calls another function, func_2, with k, x, and the sorted list as arguments. The result of func_2 is then printed. The function iterates this process for a specified number of test cases, t.
