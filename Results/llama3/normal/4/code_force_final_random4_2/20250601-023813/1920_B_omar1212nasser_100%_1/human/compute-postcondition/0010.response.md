Postcondition: **removals is a non-negative integer that must be at least 2, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order. If negatives + i is less than or equal to the length of elements, then pos is a list containing two elements: the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements', and the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element plus the element at index -(negatives + i), s is the sum of all elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element minus the element at index -(negatives + i), and s2 is the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element plus the element at index -(negatives + i) minus the element at index -(negatives + i) plus the element at index -(negatives + i). Otherwise, no changes are made.**
