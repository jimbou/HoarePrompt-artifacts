Output State: **`removals` is a non-negative integer that must be at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, `pos` is a list containing two elements: the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements', and the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element plus the element at index -(negatives + i), `s` is the sum of all elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element, `s2` is the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element plus the element at index -(negatives + i), and `i` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is that the list `pos` now contains two elements: the original sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements, and a new sum that takes into account the last 'negatives' elements minus the last element plus the element at index -(negatives + i). The other variables remain unchanged.
