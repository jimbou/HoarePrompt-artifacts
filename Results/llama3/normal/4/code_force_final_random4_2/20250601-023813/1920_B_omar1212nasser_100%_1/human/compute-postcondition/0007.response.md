To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for i in range(1, removals + 1):`

The objects involved in the loop head are `i` and `removals`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `removals + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `removals` is a non-negative integer that must be at least 1.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `removals` remains the same, but for the loop to execute again, `removals` must be at least 2.

The other variables (`negatives`, `elements`, `pos`, `s`, `s2`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`removals` is a non-negative integer that must be at least 2, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, `pos` is a list containing two elements: the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements', and the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element plus the element at index -(negatives + i), `s` is the sum of all elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element, `s2` is the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element plus the element at index -(negatives + i), and `i` is 2**
