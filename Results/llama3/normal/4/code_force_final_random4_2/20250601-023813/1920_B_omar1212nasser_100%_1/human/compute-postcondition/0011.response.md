Output State: **removals is a non-negative integer that must be at least 2, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order. If negatives + i is less than or equal to the length of elements, then pos is a list containing three elements: the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements', the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element plus the element at index -(negatives + i), and the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element plus the element at index -(negatives + i) minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element plus the element at index -(negatives + i), s is the sum of all elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element minus the element at index -(negatives + i), and s2 is the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element plus the element at index -(negatives + i) minus the element at index -(negatives + i) plus the element at index -(negatives + i). Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In natural language, the output state is: removals remains a non-negative integer that must be at least 2, negatives remains a non-negative integer, and elements remains a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order. If negatives + i is less than or equal to the length of elements, then pos now contains a new element which is the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element plus the element at index -(negatives + i). The values of s and s2 remain the same. If negatives + i is greater than the length of elements, then no changes are made to pos, s, and s2.
