Output State: **removals is a non-negative integer, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, pos is a list containing one element which is the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements', s is the sum of all elements in the list 'elements', s2 is the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements'.**

The code first initializes an empty list `pos`. Then, it calculates the sum of all elements in the list `elements` and assigns it to `s`. The sum of all elements in the list `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the list `elements` is appended to the list `pos`. Finally, the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the list `elements` is assigned to `s2`.
