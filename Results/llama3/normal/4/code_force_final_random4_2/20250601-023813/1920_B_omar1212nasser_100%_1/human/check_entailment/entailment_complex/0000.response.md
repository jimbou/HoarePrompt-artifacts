Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the game strategy for Alice and Bob. 

In the first function, func_1(), it reads the input, sorts the list of elements in ascending order, and then calls the second function, func_2(), with the sorted list and the given parameters k and x. The result of func_2() is then printed. This process is repeated for a specified number of test cases.

In the second function, func_2(), it calculates the maximum possible sum of elements after Alice and Bob's moves. It first calculates the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements'. Then, it iteratively subtracts the last 'removals' elements and adds the element at index -(negatives + i) for i from 1 to removals. The function returns the maximum value from the calculated list of sums.

The program correctly implements the game strategy for Alice and Bob. Alice removes the elements that will result in the maximum sum after Bob's move, and Bob multiplies the elements that will result in the minimum sum. The program correctly calculates the maximum possible sum after their moves.

Correctness: **True**
