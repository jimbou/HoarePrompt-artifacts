Output State: **removals is a non-negative integer that must be at least 2, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, i is 2, s is reduced by elements[-2], s2 is reduced by elements[-2].**

In this output state, the values of `removals`, `negatives`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The list `elements` also remains unchanged as it is only accessed and not modified. The variables `s` and `s2` are both reduced by the value of `elements[-2]`, which is the second last element in the sorted list `elements`.
