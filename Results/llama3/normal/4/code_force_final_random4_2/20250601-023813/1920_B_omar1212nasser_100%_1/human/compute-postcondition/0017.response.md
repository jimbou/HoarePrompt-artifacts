Output State: **removals is a non-negative integer that must be at least removals, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, pos is a list containing removals + 1 elements: the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements', and removals sums of all elements minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element plus the element at index -(negatives + i), s is the sum of all elements in the list 'elements' minus the sum of the last 'removals' elements, s2 is the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus the sum of the last 'removals' elements plus the sum of elements at index -(negatives + i) for i from 1 to removals.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the number of removals is at least the initial number of removals, the number of negatives remains unchanged, and the list of elements remains sorted in ascending order. The list 'pos' contains 'removals + 1' elements, where each element is the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements', minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element plus the element at index -(negatives + i). The sum 's' is reduced by the sum of the last 'removals' elements, and the sum 's2' is reduced by the sum of the last 'removals' elements plus the sum of elements at index -(negatives + i) for i from 1 to removals.
