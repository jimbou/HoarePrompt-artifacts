You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: removals and negatives are non-negative integers, and elements is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order.
    pos = []
    s = sum(elements)
    pos.append(s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:]))
    s2 = sum(elements[-negatives:])
    for i in range(1, removals + 1):
        s -= elements[-i]
        
        s2 -= elements[-i]
        
        if negatives + i <= len(elements):
            s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]
        
        pos.append(s - 2 * s2)
        
    #State: removals is a non-negative integer that must be at least removals, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, pos is a list containing removals + 1 elements: the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements', and removals sums of all elements minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus the last element plus the element at index -(negatives + i), s is the sum of all elements in the list 'elements' minus the sum of the last 'removals' elements, s2 is the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus the sum of the last 'removals' elements plus the sum of elements at index -(negatives + i) for i from 1 to removals.
    return max(pos)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list 'pos', which contains elements that are calculated based on the sum of all elements in the list 'elements', the sum of the last 'negatives' elements, the sum of the last 'removals' elements, and the elements at specific indices in the list 'elements'.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the maximum value from the list 'pos', which contains elements that are calculated based on the sum of all elements in the list 'elements', the sum of the last 'negatives' elements, the sum of the last 'removals' elements, and the elements at specific indices in the list 'elements'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
