To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `removals`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `removals`. If `i` is less than `removals`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `removals` is a non-negative integer that must be at least 2, and `i` is 1 (since the loop starts from 1). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `removals` remains the same, but since `i` is now 2, `removals` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`removals` is a non-negative integer that must be at least 2, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, `i` is 2**
