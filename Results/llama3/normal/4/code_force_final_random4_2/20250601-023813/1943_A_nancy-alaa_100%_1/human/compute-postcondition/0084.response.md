Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 0, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is False, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains -2 inputs, the current value of `i` is 0 and `i` is not a key in the dictionary `mpp`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` does not change the values of any variables, but it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, `_`, and `i` remain the same. The stdin still contains -2 inputs. The only change is that we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside.
