Output State: **`n` is at least 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers. The current value of `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and the count of `i` in `mpp` is 1, and `first` is True, and the value of `i` which is 0 is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, and `_` remain the same. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. The current value of `i` is still in the keys of `mpp` with a count of 1, and `first` is still True. The value of `i`, which is 0, is being printed. However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
