To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n + 1` is at least 1, meaning `n` must be at least 0. Since `i` is the loop variable, it should start at 0.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 0, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is False, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains -2 inputs, `i` is 0**
