Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, then `first` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
