Output State: **`n` is at least 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers. The current value of `i` which is 0 has a count of 1 in `mpp`. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()` or if `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and the count of `i` in `mpp` is 1 and `first` is True, then the value of `i` which is 0 is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `first` has been updated to True. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
