Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp` or `mpp[i]` is not equal to 1 or `first` is False, we continue with the rest of the program. If `mpp[i]` is equal to 1 and `first` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and print the value of `i` which is 2.***
