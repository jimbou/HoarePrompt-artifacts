To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n + 1` is greater than 0. Since `n` is an integer equal to the input value, we can adjust `n` to be greater than or equal to 0. Additionally, since `i` is `n` initially, we can adjust `i` to be equal to 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is False, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains 0 inputs**
