Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True, `_` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, and `_` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
