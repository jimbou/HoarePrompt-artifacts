Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains -2 inputs, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `_` remain unchanged, and `stdin` still contains -2 inputs. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the `break` statement.
