Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, arr is a list of integers equal to the input list, mpp is a dictionary where keys are integers from arr and values are their respective counts, first is False, _ is 2, and stdin contains -2 inputs.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    if i not in mpp.keys():
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1:
        first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer that must be at least 0, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains -2 inputs. If `i` is not a key in the dictionary `mpp`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next iteration. If `mpp[i]` is 1, then `first` is set to True, the value of `i` is printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `first` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `_` is 2, `first` is True, `stdin` contains -2 inputs. If `i` is not a key in the dictionary `mpp`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, the value of `i` is printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `_` is 2, `first` is True, `stdin` contains -2 inputs. If `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp` and its count is 1 and `first` is True, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
