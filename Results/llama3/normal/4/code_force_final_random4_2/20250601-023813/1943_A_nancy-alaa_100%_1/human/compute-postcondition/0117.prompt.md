Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4). Each test case contains two lines. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mpp = Counter(arr)
    first = False
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i not in mpp.keys():
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1:
            first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True, `_` is 0, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()` or if `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and the count of `i` in `mpp` is 1 and `first` is True, then the value of `i` is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken. If the count of `i` in `mpp` is not 1, then `first` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True if `n` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[n]` is equal to 1, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If `n` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[n]` is equal to 1, then the value of `n` is printed. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer that must be at least 0, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains -2 inputs. If `i` is not a key in the dictionary `mpp`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp` and its count is 1 and `first` is True, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
