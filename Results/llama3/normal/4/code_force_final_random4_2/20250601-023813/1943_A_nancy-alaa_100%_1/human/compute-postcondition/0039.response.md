The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_`. If `_` is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1. Also, the number of test cases in stdin must be decreased by 1.
State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True, `_` is 1, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 1 inputs: an integer and a list of integers.**
