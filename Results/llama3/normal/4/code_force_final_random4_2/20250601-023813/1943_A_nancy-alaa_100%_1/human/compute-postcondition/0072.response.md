Output: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed**
