Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers. The current value of `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and the count of `i` in `mpp` is 1, and `first` is True.***
