Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True, `_` is 0, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers. If `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and return the value of `i` which is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
