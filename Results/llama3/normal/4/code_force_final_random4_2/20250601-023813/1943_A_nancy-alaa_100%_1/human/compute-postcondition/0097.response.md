Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains -2 inputs, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code simply breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, so the values of the variables do not change. The program exits the loop or if statement it was directly inside.
