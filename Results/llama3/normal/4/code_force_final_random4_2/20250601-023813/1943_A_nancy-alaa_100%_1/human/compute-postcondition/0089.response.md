Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 0, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains -2 inputs. The current value of `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, and the value of `i` has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `i` has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains -2 inputs.
