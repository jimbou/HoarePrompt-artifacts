Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `_` is 2, `first` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and stdin contains -2 inputs.**

The code simply breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, so the values of the variables do not change. The only change is that we exit the loop or if statement.
