Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True, `_` is 0, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers. If `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, the value of `i` which is 2 is being returned. Otherwise, the program continues to the next iteration.***
