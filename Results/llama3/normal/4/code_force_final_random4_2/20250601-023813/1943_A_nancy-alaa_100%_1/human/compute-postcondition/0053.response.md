Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `_` is 1, `first` is True, and `stdin` contains 0 inputs. The current value of `mpp[i]` is 1**

In this output state, a new variable `first` has been introduced and assigned the value `True`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `mpp` still contains the counts of integers from the list `arr`, and the current value of `mpp[i]` is still 1. The input list is still stored in `arr`, and the input stream `stdin` is still empty.
