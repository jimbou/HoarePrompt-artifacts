Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `_` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code only contains a `break` statement, which does not affect the values of any variables. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `_` remain the same as in the initial state.
