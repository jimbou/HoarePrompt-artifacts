Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True, `_` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables. The value of `i` which is 1 is being printed. The stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers.
