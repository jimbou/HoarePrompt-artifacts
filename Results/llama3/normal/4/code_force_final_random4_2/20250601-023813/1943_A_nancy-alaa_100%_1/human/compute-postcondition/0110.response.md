The code prints the value of `i` which is not a key in the dictionary `mpp`. Since `i` is not a key in the dictionary `mpp`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the value of `i` that is printed is the first integer from the list `arr` that does not have a count in the dictionary `mpp`.

Output: **the first integer from the list arr that does not have a count in the dictionary mpp**
