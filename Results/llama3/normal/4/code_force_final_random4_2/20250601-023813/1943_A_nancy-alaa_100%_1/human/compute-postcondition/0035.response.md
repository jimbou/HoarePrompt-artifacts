Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True, `_` is 0, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers. If `i` is not a key in `mpp` or `mpp[i]` is not 1 or `first` is False, the program continues to the next iteration. If `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed.***
