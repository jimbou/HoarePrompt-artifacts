Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True, `_` is 0, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, and `_` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers. However, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
