Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True, `_` is 0, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()` or if `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and the count of `i` in `mpp` is 1 and `first` is True, then the value of `i` is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken. If the count of `i` in `mpp` is not 1, then `first` remains False.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the value of `i` has reached `n`. The loop has checked all values from 0 to `n` (inclusive) and has printed the first value that is not in the dictionary `mpp` or the first value that has a count of 1 in `mpp` and `first` is True. If no such value is found, the loop completes all its iterations without printing any value. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
