Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is False, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
