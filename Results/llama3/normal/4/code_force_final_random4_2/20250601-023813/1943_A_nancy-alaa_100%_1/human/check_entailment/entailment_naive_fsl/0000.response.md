Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program correctly implements the game's strategy to maximize the score by Alice and minimize it by Bob. The key insight is that Alice should try to pick the smallest possible number that appears an odd number of times in the array, while Bob should try to pick the smallest possible number that appears an even number of times.

The program uses a Counter to count the frequency of each number in the array. It then iterates through the numbers from 0 to n, checking if the current number is not present in the array (in which case it prints the current number and breaks the loop). If the current number is present in the array, it checks if its frequency is 1 and if it's the second time it encounters a number with frequency 1 (in which case it prints the current number and breaks the loop).

This strategy ensures that Alice picks the smallest possible number that appears an odd number of times, while Bob picks the smallest possible number that appears an even number of times, thus maximizing the score.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
