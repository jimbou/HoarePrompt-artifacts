The code prints the value of `i`, which is an integer from the list `arr`. Since the exact value of `i` is not specified in the precondition, we can't determine its exact numerical value. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the current value of `i`, which is an integer from the list `arr`.
Output: **i (where i is an integer from the list arr)**
