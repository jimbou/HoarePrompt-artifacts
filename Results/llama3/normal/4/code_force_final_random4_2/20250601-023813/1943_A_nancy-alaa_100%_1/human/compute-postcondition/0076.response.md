Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If `i` is in the keys of `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is equal to 1 and `first` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and prints the value of `i` which is 2. Otherwise, the program continues with the rest of the program.***
