Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True if `n` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[n]` is equal to 1, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If `n` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[n]` is equal to 1, then the value of `n` is printed. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n`, and the value of `first` will be True if `n` is in the dictionary `mpp` and its count is 1. If `n` is in `mpp` and its count is 1, then the value of `n` will be printed. Otherwise, no changes will be made to the state. The values of `arr`, `_`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
