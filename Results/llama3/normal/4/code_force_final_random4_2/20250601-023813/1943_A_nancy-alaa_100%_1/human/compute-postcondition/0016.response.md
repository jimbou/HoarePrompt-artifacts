The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 1.
State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers.**
