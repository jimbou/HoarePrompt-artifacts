Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains 0 inputs. The current value of `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True.**

This postcondition includes all the information from the precondition and adds the conditions from the if statement. It describes the state of the program variables after entering the if condition, including the relationships between them.
