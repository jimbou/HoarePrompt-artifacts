Output State: `_` is equal to the number of test cases, `n` is an integer that must be at least 0, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True, and `stdin` contains -2 inputs.

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has executed for the number of test cases specified in the input, and the variables `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `first` have been updated accordingly. The variable `_` has been incremented to keep track of the number of iterations, and the input buffer `stdin` has been consumed by 2 inputs for each iteration.
