Output State: **n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, mpp is a dictionary where keys are integers from arr and values are their respective counts, first is False, _ is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer that was read from the first input in stdin. The variable `arr` is a list of integers that were read from the second input in stdin, which was a space-separated list of integers. The variable `mpp` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers from the list `arr`, and the values are their respective counts in the list. The variable `first` is a boolean that was initialized to `False`. The variable `_` remains unchanged at 0. Stdin now contains at least 1 test case minus the 2 inputs that were read.
