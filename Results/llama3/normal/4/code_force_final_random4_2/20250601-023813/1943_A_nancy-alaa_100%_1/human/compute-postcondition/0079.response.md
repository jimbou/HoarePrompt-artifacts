Output State: **n is an integer, arr is a list of integers equal to the input list, mpp is a dictionary where keys are integers from arr and values are their respective counts, first is False, _ is 2, and stdin contains -2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to an integer value read from the input. The list `arr` now contains the integers from the input list. The dictionary `mpp` has been updated to store the counts of each integer in `arr`. The variable `first` has been set to `False`. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 2. The number of inputs in `stdin` has decreased by 2 due to the two `input()` calls.
