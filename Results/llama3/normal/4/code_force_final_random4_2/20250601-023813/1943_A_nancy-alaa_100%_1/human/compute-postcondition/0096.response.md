Output: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains -2 inputs. If `i` is not a key in the dictionary `mpp`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next iteration. If `mpp[i]` is 1, then `first` is set to True, the value of `i` is printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `first` remains False, and the value of `i` which is the first occurrence of an element in the list `arr` that appears only once is printed**
