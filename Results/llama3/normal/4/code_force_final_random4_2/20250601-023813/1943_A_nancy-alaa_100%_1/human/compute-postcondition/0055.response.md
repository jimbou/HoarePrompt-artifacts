To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If `mpp[i]` is 1, then `first` is True. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
