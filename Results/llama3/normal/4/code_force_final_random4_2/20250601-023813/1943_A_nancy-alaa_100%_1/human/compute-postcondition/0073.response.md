Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `_` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `_` remain unchanged. We exit the innermost loop or if statement, and the value of `i`, which is 2, is printed.
