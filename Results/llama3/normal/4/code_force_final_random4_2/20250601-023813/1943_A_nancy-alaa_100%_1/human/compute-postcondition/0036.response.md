Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True, `_` is 0, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers. The value of `i` which is 2 is being returned.**

The code simply sets the value of `first` to True, which does not affect the other variables. The value of `i` is still 2, and since the condition `if mpp[i] is 1 and first is True` is met, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed.
