To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 0 (since the range is `n + 1`), and `i` will start at 0.

State: **`n` is at least 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is False, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers**
