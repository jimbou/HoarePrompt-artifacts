Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `_` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `_` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the execution of the program will continue from the next line outside the loop or if statement.
