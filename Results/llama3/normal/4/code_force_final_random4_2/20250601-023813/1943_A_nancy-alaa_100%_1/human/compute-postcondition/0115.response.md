Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `_` is 2, `first` is True, `stdin` contains -2 inputs. If `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp` and its count is 1 and `first` is True, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next iteration.***
