Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True, `_` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed**.

In natural language, the output state is: The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `i`, which is 2, is being printed. The values of `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, and `_` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers.
