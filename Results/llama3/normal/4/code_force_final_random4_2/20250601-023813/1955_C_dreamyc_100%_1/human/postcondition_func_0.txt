This function determines the number of times a given condition is met for a list of positive integers. It takes three parameters: a positive integer 'n', a positive integer 'k', and a list 'nums' of 'n' positive integers. If the sum of the elements in 'nums' is less than or equal to 'k', it returns the number of positive integers in 'nums', which is 'n'. Otherwise, it calculates the ceiling and floor of 'k' divided by 2, and then iterates through 'nums' from both ends, keeping track of the sum of the first and last 'n/2' elements. It returns the number of times these sums are less than or equal to the calculated ceiling and floor values, respectively.
