Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k divided by 2, b is the floor of k divided by 2, s_a is the value of the second element of nums plus the value of the third element of nums plus the value of the third element of nums, s_b is the value of the second last element of nums plus the value of the second last element of nums plus the value of the second last element of nums, i is 2**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The list `nums` also remains the same. However, the values of `s_a` and `s_b` have been updated. `s_a` now includes the value of the third element of `nums` added to its original value, which was the sum of the second and third elements of `nums`. Similarly, `s_b` now includes the value of the second last element of `nums` added to its original value, which was the sum of the second last and last elements of `nums`.
