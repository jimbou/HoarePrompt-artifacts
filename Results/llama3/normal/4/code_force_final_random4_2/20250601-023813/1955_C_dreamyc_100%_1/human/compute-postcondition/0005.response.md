Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 0, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k divided by 2, b is the floor of k divided by 2, ans is 0, s_a is the value of the first element of nums, s_b is the value of the last element of nums, i is 0**

The code snippet increments `s_a` by the value of the first element of `nums` and `s_b` by the value of the last element of `nums`. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.
