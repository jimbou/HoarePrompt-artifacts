Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers, `a` is the ceiling of `k` divided by 2, `b` is the floor of `k` divided by 2, `s_a` is the value of the second element of `nums` plus the value of the third element of `nums`, `s_b` is the value of the second last element of `nums` plus the value of the second last element of `nums`, `i` is 1, `ans` is either 2 or 3 or the previous value of `ans` + 1**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` could be 1, 2, or the previous value of `ans` + 1. After incrementing by 1, the new value of `ans` can be 2, 3, or the previous value of `ans` + 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
