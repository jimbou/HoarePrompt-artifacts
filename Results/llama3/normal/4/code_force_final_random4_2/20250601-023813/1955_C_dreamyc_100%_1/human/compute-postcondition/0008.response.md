Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer greater than 0, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k divided by 2, b is the floor of k divided by 2, s_a is the value of the first element of nums, s_b is the value of the last element of nums, i is 0. If the value of the first element of nums is less than or equal to a, then ans is 1. Otherwise, the value of ans remains unchanged.***
