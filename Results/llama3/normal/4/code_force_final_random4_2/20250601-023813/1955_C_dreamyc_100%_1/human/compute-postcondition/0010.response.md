Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers, `a` is the ceiling of `k` divided by 2, `b` is the floor of `k` divided by 2, `s_a` is the value of the first element of `nums`, `s_b` is the value of the last element of `nums`, `i` is 0, `ans` is either 2 or the previous value of `ans` + 1, and the value of the first element of `nums` is less than or equal to `a` or the current value of `ans` remains unchanged, and the current value of `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to the first element of `nums` and `s_b` are still valid.
