Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers, `a` is the ceiling of `k` divided by 2, `b` is the floor of `k` divided by 2, `s_a` is the value of the second element of `nums` plus the value of the third element of `nums` plus the value of the third element of `nums`, `s_b` is the value of the second last element of `nums` plus the value of the second last element of `nums` plus the value of the second last element of `nums`, `i` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1. If `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`, `ans` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `s_a` is less than or equal to `a` still holds, and if it does, `ans` is increased by 1.
