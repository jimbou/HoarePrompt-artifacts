Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers, `a` is the ceiling of `k` divided by 2, `b` is the floor of `k` divided by 2, `s_a` is the value of the second element of `nums` plus the value of the third element of `nums`, `s_b` is the value of the second last element of `nums` plus the value of the second last element of `nums`, `i` is 1. If `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`, then if `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`, `ans` is either 3 or 4 or the previous value of `ans` + 2. Otherwise, `ans` is either 2 or 3 or the previous value of `ans` + 1. If `s_a` is greater than `a`, then if `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`, `ans` is either 2 or 3 or the previous value of `ans` + 2. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1 or 2 or the previous value of `ans` + 1.***
