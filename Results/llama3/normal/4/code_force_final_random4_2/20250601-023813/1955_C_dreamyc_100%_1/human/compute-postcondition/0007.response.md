Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers, `a` is the ceiling of `k` divided by 2, `b` is the floor of `k` divided by 2, `ans` is 1, `s_a` is the value of the first element of `nums`, `s_b` is the value of the last element of `nums`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `ans` being 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships.
