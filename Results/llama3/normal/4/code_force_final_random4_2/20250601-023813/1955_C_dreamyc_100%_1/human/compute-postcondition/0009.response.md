Postcondition: **n is a positive integer greater than 0, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k divided by 2, b is the floor of k divided by 2, s_a is the value of the first element of nums, s_b is the value of the last element of nums, i is 0. If the value of the first element of nums is less than or equal to a, then the current value of ans is 1. Otherwise, the current value of ans remains unchanged. Additionally, the current value of s_b is less than or equal to b.**
