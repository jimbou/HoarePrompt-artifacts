The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers, `a` is the ceiling of `k` divided by 2, `b` is the floor of `k` divided by 2, `s_a` is the value of the second element of `nums` plus the value of the third element of `nums`, `s_b` is the value of the second last element of `nums` plus the value of the second last element of `nums`, `i` is 2**
