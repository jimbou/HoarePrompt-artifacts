Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 0, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k divided by 2, b is the floor of k divided by 2, s_a is the value of the second element of nums plus the value of the third element of nums, s_b is the value of the second last element of nums plus the value of the second last element of nums, i is 1, ans is either 1 or 2 or the previous value of ans + 1**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `nums` also remains the same as it is not modified by the code. The value of `s_a` is updated to be the sum of the second element of `nums` and the third element of `nums`, and the value of `s_b` is updated to be the sum of the second last element of `nums` and the second last element of `nums`. The value of `i` remains the same as it is not modified by the code.
