    #State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k divided by 2, b is the floor of k divided by 2, s_a is the sum of the first n/2 elements of nums, s_b is the sum of the last n/2 elements of nums, i is n-1, ans is the number of times s_a and s_b are less than or equal to a and b respectively.
    return ans
    #The program returns the number of times the sum of the first n/2 elements of list 'nums' is less than or equal to the ceiling of k divided by 2 and the sum of the last n/2 elements of list 'nums' is less than or equal to the floor of k divided by 2.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the number of times a given condition is met for a list of positive integers. It takes three parameters: a positive integer 'n', a positive integer 'k', and a list 'nums' of 'n' positive integers. If the sum of the elements in 'nums' is less than or equal to 'k', it returns the number of positive integers in 'nums', which is 'n'. Otherwise, it calculates the ceiling and floor of 'k' divided by 2, and then iterates through 'nums' from both ends, keeping track of the sum of the first and last 'n/2' elements. It returns the number of times these sums are less than or equal to the calculated ceiling and floor values, respectively.
