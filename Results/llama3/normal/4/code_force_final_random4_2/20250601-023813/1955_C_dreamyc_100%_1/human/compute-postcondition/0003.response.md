Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k divided by 2, b is the floor of k divided by 2, ans is 0, s_a is 0, s_b is 0**

In this output state, the initial values of `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code introduces new variables `a`, `b`, `ans`, `s_a`, and `s_b` and assigns them specific values. `a` is assigned the ceiling of `k` divided by 2, which means it is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / 2`. `b` is assigned the floor of `k` divided by 2, which is the largest integer less than or equal to `k / 2`. `ans`, `s_a`, and `s_b` are all initialized to 0.
