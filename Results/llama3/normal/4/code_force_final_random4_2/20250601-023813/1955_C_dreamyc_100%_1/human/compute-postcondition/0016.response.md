Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers, `a` is the ceiling of `k` divided by 2, `b` is the floor of `k` divided by 2, `s_a` is the value of the second element of `nums` plus the value of the third element of `nums`, `s_b` is the value of the second last element of `nums` plus the value of the second last element of `nums`, `i` is 1. If `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`, then `ans` is either 3 or 4 or the previous value of `ans` + 2. Otherwise, `ans` is either 2 or 3 or the previous value of `ans` + 2.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. If `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`, then `ans` can be either 3 or 4 or the previous value of `ans` plus 2. Otherwise, `ans` can be either 2 or 3 or the previous value of `ans` plus 2. The values of the other variables remain the same.
