Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers, `a` is the ceiling of `k` divided by 2, `b` is the floor of `k` divided by 2, `s_a` is the value of the second element of `nums` plus the value of the third element of `nums` plus the value of the third element of `nums`, `s_b` is the value of the second last element of `nums` plus the value of the second last element of `nums` plus the value of the second last element of `nums`, `i` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `nums`, `a`, `b`, `s_a`, `s_b`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the value of `ans` is increased by 1.
