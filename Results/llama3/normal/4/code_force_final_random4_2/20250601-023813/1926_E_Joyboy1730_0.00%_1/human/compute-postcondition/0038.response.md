Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer equal to the second integer from the first pair of integers in stdin, L is an empty list, stdin contains t-3 pairs of integers, m is an integer equal to (n+1)//2, tot is an integer equal to 0, pow is an integer equal to 1**

The code snippet modifies the values of `m` and `n`. The first line updates the value of `m` to be the integer division of `n + 1` by 2. The second line subtracts the new value of `m` from `n`, effectively updating `n` to be the remainder of the division of `n` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
