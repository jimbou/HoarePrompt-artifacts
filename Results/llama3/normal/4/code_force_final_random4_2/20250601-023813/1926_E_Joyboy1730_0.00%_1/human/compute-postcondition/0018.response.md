The only variable in the loop head is variable `a` and list `L`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `L`. If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `L` has at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list `L`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the `a` is the second element in the list.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, n is an integer equal to 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, L is a list that must have at least 2 elements, a is the second element in the list L, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers, m is an integer equal to 0, tot is an integer equal to a, pow is an integer equal to 2**
