Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes t pairs of integers (n, k), and prints the result of a calculation involving these pairs. It appears to perform some sort of binary search or bit manipulation, as it uses powers of 2 and bit shifting operations. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the results directly to the console. The input variables (t, n, k) are consumed and left in a state of 0, indicating that they are no longer needed after the function concludes.**
