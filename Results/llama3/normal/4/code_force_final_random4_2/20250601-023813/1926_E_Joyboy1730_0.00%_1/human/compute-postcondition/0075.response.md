Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is an integer, `L` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in `L`, `m` is 0, `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot` plus `a`, `pow` is 1, stdin contains `t-5` pairs of integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains `t-5` pairs of integers.
