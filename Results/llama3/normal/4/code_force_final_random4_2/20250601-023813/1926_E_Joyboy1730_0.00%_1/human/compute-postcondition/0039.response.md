Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, n is 0, k is an integer equal to the second integer from the first pair of integers in stdin, L is an empty list, stdin contains t-3 pairs of integers, m is an integer equal to 0, tot is an integer equal to 0, pow is an integer equal to 1.**

The loop will continue to execute until n becomes 0. In each iteration, n is reduced by half (or half plus one if n is odd), so it will eventually reach 0. At that point, the loop will terminate, and the output state will be as described above.
