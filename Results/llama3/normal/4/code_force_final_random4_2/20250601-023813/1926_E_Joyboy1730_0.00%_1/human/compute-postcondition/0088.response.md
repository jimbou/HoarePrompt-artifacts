Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is an integer, `L` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in `L`, `m` is 0, `tot` is equal to 2a, `pow` is 4, `stdin` contains `t-5` pairs of integers. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
