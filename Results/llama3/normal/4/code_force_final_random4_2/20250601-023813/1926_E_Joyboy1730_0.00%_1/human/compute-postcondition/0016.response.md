Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `n` is an integer equal to 0, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `L` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list `L`, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers, `m` is an integer equal to 0, `tot` is an integer equal to 0, pow is an integer equal to 1. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
