Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, n is an integer between 0 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, L is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers, m is an integer equal to (n+1)//2**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `(n + 1) // 2` to `m`. Since `m` was already equal to `(n+1)//2`, this line does not change the value of `m`. The second line subtracts the value of `m` from `n`, effectively reducing `n` by half. The value of `n` is now between 0 and 10^9. No other variables are affected by the code block.
