Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, n is an integer equal to 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 minus tot, L is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers, m is an integer equal to 0, tot is an integer equal to the sum of all elements in the original list L, pow is an integer equal to 2 to the power of the number of elements in the original list L.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains 0, `k` is reduced by the sum of all elements in the original list `L`, `L` becomes empty, `stdin` still contains `t-1` pairs of integers, `m` remains 0, `tot` becomes the sum of all elements in the original list `L`, and `pow` becomes 2 raised to the power of the number of elements in the original list `L`.
