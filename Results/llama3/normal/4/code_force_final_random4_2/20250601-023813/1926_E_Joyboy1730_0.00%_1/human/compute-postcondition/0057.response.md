Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first pair of integers in stdin minus `tot` minus `tot`, `L` is a list with at least three elements, `a` is the third element of `L`, `m` is an integer equal to 0, `tot` is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 times `a`, `pow` is an integer equal to 4 times its original value, stdin contains `t-3` pairs of integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `a`, `m`, `tot`, and `pow` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means that the execution of the program will continue from the next statement outside the loop or if statement.
