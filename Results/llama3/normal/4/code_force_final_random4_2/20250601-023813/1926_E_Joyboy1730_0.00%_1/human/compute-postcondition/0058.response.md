Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first pair of integers in stdin minus `tot` minus `tot`, `L` is a list with at least three elements, `a` is the third element of `L`, `m` is an integer equal to 0, `tot` is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 times `a`, `pow` is an integer equal to 4 times its original value, stdin contains `t-3` pairs of integers. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot` plus `a`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
