According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer greater than 1, so it is already ensured that the loop will execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer equal to the second integer from the first pair of integers in stdin, L is an empty list, stdin contains t-3 pairs of integers, m is an integer equal to n//2, tot is an integer equal to 0, pow is an integer equal to 1**
