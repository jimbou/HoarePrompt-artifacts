The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `n` and `k`. So now stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers. The second line initializes an empty list `L`. The third line does not affect any variables.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, L is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers**
