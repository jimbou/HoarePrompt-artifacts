Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `n` is an integer equal to 0, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 minus tot, `L` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in the list `L`, `stdin` contains `t-1` pairs of integers, `m` is an integer equal to 0, `pow` is an integer equal to 4, `tot` is an integer equal to its original value plus `a`, and this is printed: 4 * (2 * k - 1) where k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 minus tot**
