Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, n is an integer equal to the first integer from the first pair of integers in stdin, k is an integer equal to the second integer from the first pair of integers in stdin, L is an empty list, stdin contains t-3 pairs of integers, m is an integer equal to 0, tot is an integer equal to 0, pow is an integer equal to 1.**

In this output state, the value of `n` and `k` has been updated to the first and second integer from the first pair of integers in stdin, respectively. The list `L` remains empty. The number of pairs of integers in stdin has decreased by 1. The values of `m`, `tot`, and `pow` remain unchanged.
