Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first pair of integers in stdin minus tot, `L` is a list with at least two elements, `a` is the second element of `L`, `m` is an integer equal to 0, `tot` is an integer equal to its original value plus a, `pow` is an integer equal to 2 times its original value, stdin contains t-3 pairs of integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The output state includes all the information from the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
