Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, n is an integer equal to 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, L is a list that must have at least 2 elements, a is the second element in the list L, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers, m is an integer equal to 0, pow is an integer equal to 2. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot plus a, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
