Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first pair of integers in stdin, `L` is a list with at least one element, `a` is the first element of `L`, `m` is an integer equal to 0, `tot` is an integer with a value less than `k`, `pow` is an integer equal to 1, stdin contains t-3 pairs of integers, and the current value of `k` is less than or equal to the sum of `tot` and `a`, and this is printed: 1 * (2 * k - 1), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-3 pairs of integers. The condition that the current value of `k` is less than or equal to the sum of `tot` and `a` is still valid, and the expression 1 * (2 * k - 1) has been printed.
