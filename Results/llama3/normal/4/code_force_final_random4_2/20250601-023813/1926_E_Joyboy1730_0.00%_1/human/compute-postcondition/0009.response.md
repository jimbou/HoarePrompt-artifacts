Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, n is an integer equal to 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, L is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers, m is an integer equal to 0**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `n` is equal to 0, and the variable `m` is equal to 0. The other variables in the precondition, `t`, `k`, `L`, and `stdin`, remain unchanged.
