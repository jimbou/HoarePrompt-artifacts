Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, stdin contains t inputs: t pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first input integer, which is between 1 and 5 * 10^4. The stdin now contains t inputs, which are t pairs of integers n and k, where 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9. The values of the other variables are not affected.
