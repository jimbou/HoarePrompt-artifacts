Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, n is 0, k is an integer, L is a list that must have at least 1 element, a is the first element in L, m is 0, tot is equal to a, k is less than or equal to a, pow is 2, stdin contains t-5 pairs of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `tot` has been updated to be equal to `a`, because `tot` was initially less than or equal to `k` and `k` was less than or equal to `tot` plus `a`, so the condition to break out of the most internal loop or if statement was not met, and `tot` was incremented by `a`. The value of `k` has been updated to be less than or equal to `a`, because `k` was decremented by `tot`, which is now equal to `a`. The value of `pow` has been updated to be 2, because it was multiplied by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
