Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, n is an integer equal to 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, L is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers, m is an integer equal to 0, tot is an integer equal to 0, pow is an integer equal to 1**

The code initializes two new variables, `tot` and `pow`, and assigns them the values 0 and 1, respectively. The rest of the variables and stdin remain unchanged.
