Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `n` is an integer equal to 0, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 minus tot, `L` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in the list `L`, `m` is an integer equal to 0, `pow` is an integer equal to 4, `tot` is an integer equal to its original value plus `a`. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot` plus `a`, the value 4 * (2 * k - 1) has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
