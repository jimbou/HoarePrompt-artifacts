Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `n` is an integer equal to 0, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `L` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list `L`, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers, `m` is an integer equal to 0, `tot` is an integer equal to 0, pow is an integer equal to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The current value of `tot` is still less than `k` and `k` is still less than or equal to the sum of `tot` and `a`.
