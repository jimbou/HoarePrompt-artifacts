The code prints the product of `pow` and the result of the expression `2 * k - 1`, where `pow` is 1 and `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first pair of integers in stdin.
Output: ** `t` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first pair of integers in stdin, `L` is a list with at least one element, `a` is the first element of `L`, `m` is an integer equal to 0, `tot` is an integer with a value less than `k`, `pow` is an integer equal to 1, stdin contains t-3 pairs of integers, and the current value of `k` is less than or equal to the sum of `tot` and `a`, and this is printed: 1 * (2 * k - 1) **
