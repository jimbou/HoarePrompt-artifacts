Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, n is an integer equal to 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, L is a list that must have at least 2 elements, a is the second element in the list L, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers, m is an integer equal to 0, tot is an integer equal to a, pow is an integer equal to 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains t-1 pairs of integers, and the result of the expression pow * (2 * k - 1) is still being printed, where pow is 2 and k is an integer between 1 and 10^9.
