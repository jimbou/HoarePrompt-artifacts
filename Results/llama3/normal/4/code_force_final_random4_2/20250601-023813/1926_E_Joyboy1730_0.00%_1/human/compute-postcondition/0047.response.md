Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, n is 0, k is an integer equal to the second integer from the first pair of integers in stdin minus tot, L is a list with at least one element, a is the first element of L, m is an integer equal to 0, tot is an integer equal to its original value plus a, pow is an integer equal to 2 times its original value, stdin contains t-3 pairs of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `tot` has been incremented by the value of `a`, and the value of `k` has been decremented by the new value of `tot`. The value of `pow` has been doubled. All other variables remain unchanged.
