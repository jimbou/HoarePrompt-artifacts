Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, n is 0, k is an integer equal to the second integer from the first pair of integers in stdin, L is an empty list, stdin contains t-3 pairs of integers, m is an integer equal to 0, tot is an integer equal to 0, pow is an integer equal to 1.
Code of the loop:
for a in L:
    if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
        print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
        break
    tot += a
    k -= tot
    pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, n is 0, k is an integer equal to the second integer from the first pair of integers in stdin minus tot, L is a list with at least one element, a is the first element of L, m is an integer equal to 0, tot is an integer equal to its original value plus a, pow is an integer equal to 2 times its original value, stdin contains t-3 pairs of integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, n is 0, k is an integer equal to the second integer from the first pair of integers in stdin minus tot minus tot, L is a list with at least two elements, a is the second element of L, m is an integer equal to 0, tot is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 times a, pow is an integer equal to 4 times its original value, stdin contains t-3 pairs of integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, n is 0, k is an integer equal to the second integer from the first pair of integers in stdin minus 3 times tot minus a, L is a list with at least three elements, a is the third element of L, m is an integer equal to 0, tot is an integer equal to its original value plus 3 times a, pow is an integer equal to 8 times its original value, stdin contains t-3 pairs of integers.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
