The variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is a non-zero integer equal to (n - (n + 1) // 2), So for the loop to be executed one more time n needed to have been equal to (n + 1) // 2 and n currently must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, n is a non-zero integer equal to (n + 1) // 2 and n currently must be greater than 0, k is an integer, L is an empty list, a is undefined, m is (n + 1) // 2, tot is 0, pow is 1, stdin contains t-5 pairs of integers**
