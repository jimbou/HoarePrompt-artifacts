Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, n is 0, k is an integer equal to the second integer from the first pair of integers in stdin, L is an empty list, stdin contains t-3 pairs of integers, m is an integer equal to 0, tot is an integer equal to 0, pow is an integer equal to 1.**

The code snippet consists of two lines, both of which assign new values to existing variables. The first line sets `tot` to 0, overwriting its previous value of 0. The second line sets `pow` to 1, overwriting its previous value of 1. 

Since both lines assign the same values that the variables already had, the state of the program remains unchanged. All variables retain their initial values, and the contents of stdin are unaffected.
