Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, stdin contains t inputs: t pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    L = []
    while n:
        m = (n + 1) // 2
        n -= m
    tot = 0
    pow = 1
    for a in L:
        if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
            print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
            break
        tot += a
        k -= tot
        pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, n is an integer equal to 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 minus tot, L is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers, m is an integer equal to 0, tot is an integer equal to the sum of all elements in the original list L, pow is an integer equal to 2 to the power of the number of elements in the original list L.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, n is 0, k is an integer equal to the second integer from the first pair of integers in stdin minus tot, L is an empty list, a is the last element of L, m is an integer equal to 0, tot is an integer equal to the sum of all elements in L, pow is an integer equal to 2 to the power of the number of elements in L, stdin contains t-3 pairs of integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, n is 0, k is an integer, L is a list that must have at least 3 elements, a is the last element in L, m is 0, tot is equal to the sum of all elements in L, pow is 2 to the power of the number of elements in L, stdin contains t-5 pairs of integers.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
