Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is an integer, `L` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in `L`, `m` is 0, `tot` is equal to `a`, `k` is less than or equal to `a`, `pow` is 2, stdin contains `t-5` pairs of integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The list `L` still has at least 2 elements, with `a` being the second element. The relationship between `k` and `a` remains the same, with `k` being less than or equal to `a`. The input stream still contains `t-5` pairs of integers.
