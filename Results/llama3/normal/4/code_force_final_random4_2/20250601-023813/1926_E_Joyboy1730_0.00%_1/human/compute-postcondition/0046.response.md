Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first pair of integers in stdin, `L` is a list with at least one element, `a` is the first element of `L`, `m` is an integer equal to 0, `tot` is an integer, `pow` is an integer equal to 1, stdin contains t-3 pairs of integers. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to the sum of `tot` and `a`, then the value 1 * (2 * k - 1) is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
