The code prints the result of the expression `pow * (2 * k - 1)`. 

Here, `pow` is given as 4, and `k` is an integer less than or equal to `a`. 

Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the expression `pow * (2 * k - 1)`.

Output: **4 * (2 * k - 1) (where k is an integer less than or equal to a)**
