According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n. If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer equal to n - m. For the loop to be executed one more time n must be greater than 0. So n must be greater than m. Also, m is an integer equal to (n+1)//2, so n must be greater than (n+1)//2. So n must be greater than (n+1)//2 and n must be greater than m.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, L is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers, m is an integer equal to (n+1)//2, n is an integer equal to n - m and n must be greater than (n+1)//2 and n must be greater than m**
