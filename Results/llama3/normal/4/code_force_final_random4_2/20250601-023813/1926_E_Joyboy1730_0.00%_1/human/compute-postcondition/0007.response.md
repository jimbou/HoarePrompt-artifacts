The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer equal to n - m and n must be greater than (n+1)//2 and n must be greater than m. n being greater than (n+1)//2 and n must be greater than m does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to n must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, L is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers, m is an integer equal to (n+1)//2, n must be greater than 0**
