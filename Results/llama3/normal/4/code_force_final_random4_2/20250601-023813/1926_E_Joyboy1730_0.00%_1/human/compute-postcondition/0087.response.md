Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is an integer, `L` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in `L`, `m` is 0, `tot` is equal to 2a, `k` is less than or equal to `a`, `pow` is 4, `stdin` contains `t-5` pairs of integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `a`, `m`, `tot`, and `pow` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t-5` pairs of integers.
