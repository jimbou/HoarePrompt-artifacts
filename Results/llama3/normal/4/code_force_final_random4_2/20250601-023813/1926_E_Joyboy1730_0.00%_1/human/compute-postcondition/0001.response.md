To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the loop variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the loop execution directly). However, since `_` is not used in the loop body, we can ignore it.

The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, stdin contains t inputs: t pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**
