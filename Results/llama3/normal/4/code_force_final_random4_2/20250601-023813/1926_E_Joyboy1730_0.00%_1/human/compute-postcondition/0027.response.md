Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `n` is an integer equal to 0, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 minus tot, `L` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in the list `L`, `m` is an integer equal to 0, `pow` is an integer equal to 4, `tot` is an integer equal to its original value plus `a`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value 4 * (2 * k - 1) where k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 minus tot has been printed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value 4 * (2 * k - 1) has been printed, where k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 minus tot.
