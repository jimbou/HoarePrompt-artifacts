Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, n is an integer equal to 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, L is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers, m is an integer equal to 0, tot is an integer equal to 0, pow is an integer equal to 1
Code of the loop:
for a in L:
    if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
        print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
        break
    tot += a
    k -= tot
    pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, n is an integer equal to 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, L is a list that must have at least 1 element, a is the first element in the list L, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers, m is an integer equal to 0, tot is an integer equal to a, pow is an integer equal to 2. If k is less than or equal to a, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, n is an integer equal to 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 minus tot, L is a list that must have at least 2 elements, a is the second element in the list L, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers, m is an integer equal to 0, pow is an integer equal to 4, tot is an integer equal to its original value plus a.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, n is an integer equal to 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 minus tot, L is a list that must have at least 3 elements, a is the third element in the list L, m is an integer equal to 0, pow is an integer equal to 8, tot is an integer equal to its original value plus 2a.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
