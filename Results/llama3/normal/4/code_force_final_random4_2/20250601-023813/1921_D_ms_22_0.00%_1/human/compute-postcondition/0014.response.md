Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing two tuples, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, then `max_heap` contains two tuples (-`diff1`, `i`, 0) and (-`diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`). Otherwise, `max_heap` contains two tuples (-`diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`) and (-`diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`).**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that `max_heap` now contains two tuples instead of one. The first tuple is the same as in the initial state, and the second tuple is the new tuple that was pushed onto the heap.
