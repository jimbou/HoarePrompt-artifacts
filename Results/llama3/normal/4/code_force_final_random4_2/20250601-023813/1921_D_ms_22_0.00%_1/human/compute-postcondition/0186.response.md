Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is either 0 or m, tp2 is either m - 1 or 0, ans is the sum of the absolute differences between the last integer in list a and the first integer in list b, i is None, diff1 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the last integer in list b, item is None, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and ans is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `t` remains unchanged, which means it is still greater than or equal to 0.
* The value of `n` is now 0, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times.
* The value of `m` remains unchanged, which means it is still an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `n`.
* The list `a` remains unchanged, which means it is still a list of integers.
* The list `b` remains unchanged, which means it is still a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9.
* The list `max_heap` is now empty, indicating that all elements have been popped from the heap.
* The value of `tp1` is either 0 or `m`, indicating that the pointer has reached the end of the list `b`.
* The value of `tp2` is either `m - 1` or 0, indicating that the pointer has reached the beginning of the list `b`.
* The value of `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between the last integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`.
* The value of `i` is None, indicating that there is no current index.
* The value of `diff1` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`.
* The value of `diff2` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`.
* The value of `item` is None, indicating that there is no current item.
* The value of `stdin` remains unchanged, which means it still contains multiple test cases minus one.
* The value of `ans` is printed, indicating that the final answer has been calculated and printed.
