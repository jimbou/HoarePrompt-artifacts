Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is an empty list, i is the last integer in the list, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap contains n - 1 tuples, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, diff1 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the last integer in list b. The current value of item[2] is either less than tp1 or greater than tp2. The current value of diff1 is greater than diff2, item is (-diff1, i, 0) and max_heap contains n - 1 tuples (-diff2, i, m - 1).***
