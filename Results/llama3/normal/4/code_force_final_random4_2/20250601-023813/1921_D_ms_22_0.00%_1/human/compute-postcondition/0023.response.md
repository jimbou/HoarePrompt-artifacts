Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `n`, `a` is an empty list, `i` is the last integer in the list, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9, `max_heap` contains `n - 1` tuples, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, then `item` is (-`diff1`, `i`, 0) and `max_heap` contains `n - 1` tuples (-`diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`). Otherwise, `item` is (-`diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`) and `max_heap` contains `n - 1` tuples (-`diff1`, `i`, 0).**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is decreased by 1, and one test case is removed from the standard input. The value of `n` and `m` remains the same. The list `a` is still empty, and the value of `i` is still the last integer in the list. The list `b` is still sorted and contains `m` integers between 1 and 10^9. The `max_heap` now contains one less tuple, and the value of `tp1` and `tp2` remains the same. The value of `ans` is still 0. The value of `diff1` and `diff2` remains the same. The `item` variable is assigned the value of the tuple with the maximum difference, which is either (-`diff1`, `i`, 0) or (-`diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`).
