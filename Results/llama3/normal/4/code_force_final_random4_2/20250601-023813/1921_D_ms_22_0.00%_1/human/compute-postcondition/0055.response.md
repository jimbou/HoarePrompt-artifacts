Postcondition: **t is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is an empty list, i is the last integer in the list, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap contains one less tuple than before, item is the tuple with the maximum value in max_heap before the operation, tp1 and tp2 are either 0, 1, 2 or m - 1, m - 2, m - 3, m - 4, ans is the original value of ans plus either diff1 or diff2, diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp1], diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp2]. If diff1 is greater than diff2, ans is the original value of ans plus diff1, otherwise ans is the original value of ans plus diff2.**
