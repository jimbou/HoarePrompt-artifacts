Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `n`, `a` is an empty list, `i` is the last integer in the list, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9, `max_heap` contains one less tuple than before, `item` is the tuple with the maximum value in `max_heap` before the operation, `tp1` is either 1 or 2, `tp2` is either `m - 1` or `m - 2`, `ans` is either `diff1` or `diff1` minus `item[0]`. If `diff1` <= `diff2` and `item[2]` is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `item` is either `(-diff1, i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 2)`, `max_heap` contains either `n - 1` tuples `(-diff2, i, m - 2)` or `n - 1` tuples `(-diff1, i, 0)`, `tp1` is either 0 or 1, `tp2` is either `m - 2` or `m - 3`, `ans` is either `diff1` plus the original value of `ans` or the original value of `ans` plus `diff2` minus `item[0]`. If `diff1` <= `diff2` and `item[2]` is greater than or equal to `tp1` and less than or equal to `tp2`, then `item` is either `(-diff1, i, 0)` and `max_heap` contains `n - 1` tuples `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 2)`, `tp1` is either 0, 1 or 2, `tp2` is either `m - 1`, `m - 2` or `m - 3`, `ans` is either `diff1` minus `item[0]` or the original value of `ans` plus `diff2` minus `item[0]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `max_heap` now contains one less tuple, and `item` is the tuple with the maximum value that was removed from `max_heap`. The values of `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state.
