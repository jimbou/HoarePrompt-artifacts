Output State: **t is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is an empty list, i is the last integer in the list, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap contains one less tuple than before, item is the tuple with the maximum value in max_heap before the operation, tp1 is either 0, 1 or 2, tp2 is either m - 1, m - 2 or m - 3, ans is either diff1 plus the original value of ans or the original value of ans plus diff2 minus item[0], diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp1], diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp2].**

The code calculates the absolute differences between `item[1]` and the values at indices `tp1` and `tp2` in list `b`, and assigns these differences to `diff1` and `diff2`, respectively. The values of `tp1` and `tp2` are either 0, 1, or 2, and `m - 1`, `m - 2`, or `m - 3`, respectively, depending on the conditions in the precondition. The value of `ans` is updated based on the values of `diff1` and `diff2`, and the original value of `ans`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
