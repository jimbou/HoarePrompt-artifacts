Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing one tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, the current value of `diff1` is greater than the current value of `diff2`, where `diff1` is the absolute difference between the first integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the first integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is decreased by 1, and the number of test cases in stdin is also decreased by 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` remain the same. The `max_heap` is updated to contain a tuple with the negative value of `diff1`, the index `i`, and 0. The relationship between `diff1` and `diff2` remains the same.
