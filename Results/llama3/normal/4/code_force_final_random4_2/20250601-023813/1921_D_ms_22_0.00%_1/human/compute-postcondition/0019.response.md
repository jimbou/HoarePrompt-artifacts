Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing three tuples, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the third integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the third integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, then `max_heap` contains three tuples (-`diff1`, `i`, 0), (-`diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`), and (-`diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`). Otherwise, `max_heap` contains three tuples (-`diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`), (-`diff1`, `i`, 0), and (-`diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`).**

In natural language, the output state is: the value of `t` remains the same, the number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1, the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain the same. The `max_heap` now contains three tuples, with the new tuple being (-`diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`). The order of the tuples in `max_heap` depends on the values of `diff1` and `diff2`.
