Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing two integers n and m, and two lists of integers a and b. It calculates the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each integer in list a and the integers in list b, and prints this sum for each test case. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.**
