Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than 0, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is an empty list, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is a list containing n - 1 tuples, either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 1) depending on whether diff1 is greater than diff2, tp1 is 1, tp2 is m - 1, ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the popped tuple's first element and the first integer in list b, i is the index of the popped tuple, the current value of item is the popped tuple, the current value of item[2] is either less than tp1 or greater than tp2, the current value of diff1 is the absolute difference between the popped tuple's first element and the first integer in list b, the current value of diff2 is the absolute difference between the popped tuple's first element and the last integer in list b, and the current value of diff1 is greater than diff2.**

The code increments `tp1` by 1 and adds the absolute difference between the popped tuple's first element and the first integer in list `b` to `ans`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
