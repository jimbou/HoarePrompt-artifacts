Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the total difference D. The issue lies in the way it uses a max heap to store the differences between elements of array a and the smallest and largest elements of array b. The program incorrectly assumes that the maximum difference can be obtained by always choosing the largest difference between an element of a and either the smallest or largest element of b. However, this approach does not consider the optimal arrangement of elements in array c to maximize the total difference D.

A counterexample can be constructed as follows:

Input:

n = 3, m = 5
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

The program will output 0, but the correct output should be 6, which can be obtained by arranging the elements of b as [1, 1, 1, 1, 3] and calculating the total difference D as |1-1| + |2-1| + |3-3| = 0 + 1 + 5 = 6.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
