Postcondition: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is a non-empty list containing at least one tuples with the absolute differences between each integer in list a and either the first or last integer in list b, tp1 is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, tp2 is either m - 1, m - 2, m - 3 or m - 4, ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between item[1] and either the first or last integer in list b, i is the last integer in the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the first integer in list b, and diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the last integer in list b, item is the tuple with the maximum absolute difference between an integer in list a and either the first or last integer in list b has been removed from max_heap and assigned to item variable, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If diff1 > diff2, then tp1 is either 1, 2 or 3, otherwise tp1 is either 0, 1 or 2. If diff1 > diff2, then tp2 is either m - 1, m - 2 or m - 3, otherwise tp2 is either m - 2, m - 3 or m - 4.**
