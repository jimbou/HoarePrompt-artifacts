Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than 0, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `n`, `a` is an empty list, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing `n - 1` tuples, either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 1) depending on whether `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the index of the popped tuple, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`, `item` is the popped tuple, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and `ans` is printed. The current value of `item[2]` is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`***
