The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than 0, So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is either 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., n, tp2 is either m - 1, m - 2, m - 3, ..., m - n, ans is either the original value of ans plus or minus the absolute difference between item[1] and either the first or last integer in list b, i is the last integer in the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the first integer in list b, and diff2 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the last integer in list b, item is None, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and ans is printed**
