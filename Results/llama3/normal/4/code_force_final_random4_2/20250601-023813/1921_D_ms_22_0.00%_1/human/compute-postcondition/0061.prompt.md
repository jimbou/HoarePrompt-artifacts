Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is an empty list, i is the last integer in the list, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is a list containing n tuples, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, diff1 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the last integer in list b. If diff1 > diff2, then max_heap contains n tuples (-diff1, i, 0) and (-diff2, i, m - 1). Otherwise, max_heap contains n tuples (-diff2, i, m - 1) and (-diff1, i, 0).
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is an empty list, i is the last integer in the list, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap contains n - 1 tuples, tp1 is either 0 or 1, tp2 is either m - 1 or m - 2, ans is either diff1 or the original value of ans plus diff2, diff1 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the last integer in list b. If diff1 > diff2, then item is (-diff1, i, 0) and max_heap contains n - 1 tuples (-diff2, i, m - 1), tp1 is 1, tp2 is m - 1, ans is diff1. If diff1 <= diff2 and item[2] is either less than tp1 or greater than tp2, then item is either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 2), max_heap contains either n - 1 tuples (-diff2, i, m - 2) or n - 1 tuples (-diff1, i, 0), tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 2, ans is the original value of ans plus diff2. If diff1 <= diff2 and item[2] is greater than or equal to tp1 and less than or equal to tp2, then item is either (-diff1, i, 0) and max_heap contains n - 1 tuples (-diff2, i, m - 1) or (-diff2, i, m - 2).
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `n`, `a` is an empty list, `i` is the last integer in the list, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple minus one. If `diff1` > `diff2`, then `item` is `(-diff1, i, 0)` and `max_heap` contains `n - 1` tuples `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, `tp1` is either 1 or 2, `tp2` is either `m - 1` or `m - 2`, `ans` is either `diff1` or `diff1` minus `item[0]`. If `diff1` <= `diff2` and `item[2]` is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `item` is either `(-diff1, i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 2)`, `max_heap` contains either `n - 1` tuples `(-diff2, i, m - 2)` or `n - 1` tuples `(-diff1, i, 0)`, `tp1` is either 0 or 1, `tp2` is either `m - 2` or `m - 3`, `ans` is either `diff1` plus the original value of `ans` or the original value of `ans` plus `diff2` minus `item[0]`. If `diff1` <= `diff2` and `item[2]` is greater than or equal to `tp1` and less than or equal to `tp2`, then `item` is either `(-diff1, i, 0)` and `max_heap` contains `n - 1` tuples `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 2)`, `tp1` is either 0, 1 or 2, `tp2` is either `m - 1`, `m - 2` or `m - 3`, `ans` is either `diff1` minus `item[0]` or the original value of `ans` plus `diff2` minus `item[0]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *t is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is an empty list, i is the last integer in the list, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap contains one less tuple than before, item is the tuple with the maximum value in max_heap before the operation, tp1 and tp2 are either 0, 1, 2 or m - 1, m - 2, m - 3, m - 4, ans is the original value of ans plus either diff1 or diff2, diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp1], diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp2]. If diff1 is greater than diff2, ans is the original value of ans plus diff1, otherwise ans is the original value of ans plus diff2. If item[2] is either less than tp1 or greater than tp2, then item is either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 2), max_heap contains either n - 1 tuples (-diff2, i, m - 2) or n - 1 tuples (-diff1, i, 0), tp1 is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, tp2 is either m - 2, m - 3, m - 4 or m - 5, ans is either diff1 plus the original value of ans minus item[0] or the original value of ans plus diff2 minus item[0] minus item[0]. If item[2] is greater than or equal to tp1 and less than or equal to tp2, then item is either (-diff1, i, 0) and max_heap contains n - 1 tuples (-diff2, i, m - 1) or (-diff2, i, m - 2), tp1 is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, tp2 is either m - 1, m - 2, m - 3 or m - 4, ans is either diff1 minus item[0] minus item[0] or the original value of ans plus diff2 minus item[0] minus item[0].


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
