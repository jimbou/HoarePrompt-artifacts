Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by arranging the integers in list b to be as different as possible from the integers in list a.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases t from stdin.

2. For each test case, it reads the integers n and m, and the lists of integers a and b.

3. It sorts the list b in ascending order.

4. It creates a max heap to store the differences between each integer in list a and the integers in list b. The max heap is used to keep track of the maximum difference that can be obtained for each integer in list a.

5. It initializes two pointers, tp1 and tp2, to the start and end of the sorted list b, respectively.

6. It iterates over the integers in list a, and for each integer, it calculates the absolute differences with the integers at the current positions of tp1 and tp2 in list b. It pushes the maximum difference and the corresponding integer from list a and the position in list b into the max heap.

7. It then pops the maximum difference from the max heap, and updates the total difference ans accordingly. If the popped difference corresponds to the integer at the current position of tp1, it increments tp1. Otherwise, it decrements tp2.

8. It repeats steps 6 and 7 until the max heap is empty.

9. Finally, it prints the total difference ans, which is the maximum total difference D that can be obtained.

The program's logic is correct, and it correctly implements the algorithm to find the maximum total difference D. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
