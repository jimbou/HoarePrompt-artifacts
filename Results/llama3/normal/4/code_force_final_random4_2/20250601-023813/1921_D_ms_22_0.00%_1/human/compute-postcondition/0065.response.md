Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is the last integer in the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the last integer in list b.**

Explanation:

The code block executes the following operations:

1. `t -= 1`: Decrements the value of `t` by 1.

2. `n, m = map(int, input().split())`: Assigns the values of `n` and `m` from the input.

3. `a = list(map(int, input().split()))`: Assigns a list of `n` integers to `a`.

4. `b = list(map(int, input().split()))`: Assigns a list of `m` integers to `b`.

5. `b.sort()`: Sorts the list `b` in ascending order.

6. `max_heap = []`: Initializes an empty list `max_heap`.

7. `tp1 = 0`: Assigns the value 0 to `tp1`.

8. `tp2 = m - 1`: Assigns the value `m - 1` to `tp2`.

9. `ans = 0`: Initializes the value of `ans` to 0.

After executing these operations, the final state of the variables is as follows:

- `t` is decremented by 1.

- `n` and `m` are assigned new values from the input.

- `a` is a list of `n` integers.

- `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers.

- `max_heap` is an empty list.

- `tp1` is 0.

- `tp2` is `m - 1`.

- `ans` is 0.

- `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one.

- `i` is the last integer in the list `a`.

- `diff1` and `diff2` are the absolute differences between the last integer in list `a` and the first and last integers in list `b`, respectively.
