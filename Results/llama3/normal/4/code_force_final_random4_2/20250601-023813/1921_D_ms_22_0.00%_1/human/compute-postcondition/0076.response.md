Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing two tuples with the absolute differences between the second integer in list `a` and either the first or last integer in list `b`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is the second integer in the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`.**

In this output state, the `max_heap` list now contains two tuples. The first tuple is the one that was already present, and the second tuple is the new one that was pushed onto the heap. The new tuple contains the negative of `diff1`, which is the absolute difference between the second integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, as well as the value of `i`, which is the second integer in list `a`, and 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
