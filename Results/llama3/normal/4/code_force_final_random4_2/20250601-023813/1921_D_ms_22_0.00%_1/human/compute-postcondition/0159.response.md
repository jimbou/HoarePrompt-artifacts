Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than 0, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing `n - 1` tuples, either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 1) depending on whether `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `tp1` is 1, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b` if the second element of the popped tuple `item` is less than `tp1`, otherwise it is increased by the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`, `i` is the index of the popped tuple, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`, `item` is the popped tuple, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and `ans` is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `tp1` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` is still empty, and the list `b` is still sorted. The `max_heap` still contains `n - 1` tuples, and the values of `tp2`, `ans`, `i`, `diff1`, `diff2`, and `item` are still the same. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, and `ans` is still printed.
