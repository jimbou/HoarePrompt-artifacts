Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than 0, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is an empty list, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is a list containing n - 1 tuples, either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 1) depending on whether diff1 is greater than diff2, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 2, ans is greater than 0, i is the index of the popped tuple, diff1 is the absolute difference between the popped tuple's first element and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the popped tuple's first element and the last integer in list b, item is the popped tuple, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and ans is printed. The current value of item[2] is either less than tp1 or greater than tp2. diff1 is less than or equal to diff2.**

In this final state, the value of tp2 has been decremented by 1, and the value of ans has been incremented by diff2. The other variables remain unchanged.
