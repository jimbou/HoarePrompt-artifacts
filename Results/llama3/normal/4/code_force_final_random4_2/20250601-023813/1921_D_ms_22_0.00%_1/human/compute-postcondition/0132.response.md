Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing one tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the first integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the first integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`, `item` is None, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and `ans` is printed.**

In this output state, the `max_heap` list now contains a tuple with three elements: the negative value of `diff1` (which is the absolute difference between the first integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`), the value of `i` (which is the first integer in list `a`), and 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
