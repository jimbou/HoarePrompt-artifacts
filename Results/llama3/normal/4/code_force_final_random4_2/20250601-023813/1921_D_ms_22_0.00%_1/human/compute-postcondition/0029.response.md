Output State: **t is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is an empty list, i is the last integer in the list, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap contains n - 1 tuples, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 2, ans is the original value of ans plus diff2, diff1 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the last integer in list b. The absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the first integer in list b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the last integer in list b. If the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the first integer in list b is less than the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the last integer in list b, then item is (-diff2, i, m - 2) and max_heap contains n - 1 tuples (-diff1, i, 0). Otherwise, item is (-diff1, i, 0) and max_heap contains n - 1 tuples (-diff2, i, m - 2). The current value of item[2] is either less than tp1 or greater than tp2, diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the last integer in list b.**

In this final state, the value of `tp2` has been decremented by 1, and the value of `ans` has been incremented by `diff2`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
