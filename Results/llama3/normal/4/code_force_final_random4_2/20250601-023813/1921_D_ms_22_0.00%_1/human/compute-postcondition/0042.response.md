Output State: **tp1 is 1, ans is diff1 plus the original value of ans, t is greater than 0 minus 1, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is an empty list, i is the last integer in the list, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap contains at least one tuple minus one, tp2 is either m - 1 or m - 2, diff1 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the last integer in list b.**

The code increments `tp1` by 1, making it equal to 1. It also adds `diff1` to `ans`, updating its value. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
