The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is the next integer in the list `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be the second integer in the list `a`.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing one tuple with the absolute difference between the second integer in list `a` and either the first or last integer in list `b`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is the second integer in the list `a`, and the absolute difference between the second integer in list `a` and the first or last integer in list `b` is stored in `max_heap` based on whether the absolute difference between the second integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b` is greater than or less than or equal to the absolute difference between the second integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`.
