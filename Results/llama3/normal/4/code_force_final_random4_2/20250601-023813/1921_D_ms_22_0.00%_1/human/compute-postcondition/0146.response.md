Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `n`, `a` is an empty list, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples, either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 1) depending on whether `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is None, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`, `item` is None, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and `ans` is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the list `a` is exhausted, and the `max_heap` contains `n` tuples, each representing the maximum difference between an element in `a` and an element in `b`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `t` being greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `m` being within their specified ranges, `b` being a sorted list, and `tp1` and `tp2` being at their initial values. The `ans` variable is still 0, and `i` is None since the loop has finished iterating over `a`. The `diff1` and `diff2` variables hold the absolute differences between the last element in `a` and the first and last elements in `b`, respectively.
