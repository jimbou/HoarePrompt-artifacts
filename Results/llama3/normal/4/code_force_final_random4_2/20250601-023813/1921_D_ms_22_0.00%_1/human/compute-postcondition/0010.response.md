Postcondition: **t is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 that must have at least 1 integer, i is the first integer in the list, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is a list containing one tuple, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, diff1 is the absolute difference between the first integer in list a and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the first integer in list a and the last integer in list b. If diff1 > diff2, then max_heap contains one tuple (-diff1, i, 0). Otherwise, max_heap contains one tuple (-diff2, i, m - 1).**
