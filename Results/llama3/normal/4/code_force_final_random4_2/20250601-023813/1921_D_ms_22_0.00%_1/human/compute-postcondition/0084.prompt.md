Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is the last integer in the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the last integer in list b.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    diff1 = abs(i - b[0])
    diff2 = abs(i - b[m - 1])
    if diff1 > diff2:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))
    else:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is a list containing one tuple with the absolute difference between the first integer in list a and either the first or last integer in list b, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is the first integer in the list a, and the absolute difference between the first integer in list a and the first or last integer in list b is stored in max_heap based on whether the absolute difference between the first integer in list a and the first integer in list b is greater than or less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first integer in list a and the last integer in list b.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is a list containing two tuples with the absolute differences between the second integer in list a and either the first or last integer in list b, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is the second integer in the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between the second integer in list a and the first integer in list b, and diff2 is the absolute difference between the second integer in list a and the last integer in list b. If diff1 > diff2, max_heap contains two tuples with the absolute differences between the second integer in list a and either the first or last integer in list b. Otherwise, max_heap contains two tuples with the absolute differences between the second integer in list a and either the first or last integer in list b.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is a list containing three tuples with the absolute differences between the third integer in list a and either the first or last integer in list b, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is the third integer in the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between the third integer in list a and the first integer in list b, and diff2 is the absolute difference between the third integer in list a and the last integer in list b. The max_heap list contains three tuples, either with the absolute differences between the third integer in list a and the first integer in list b, or with the absolute differences between the third integer in list a and the last integer in list b, depending on whether diff1 is greater than diff2 or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
