To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the state of `max_heap` since it's the only variable in the loop head. The loop will execute as long as `max_heap` is not empty.

State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is a non-empty list containing n tuples with the absolute differences between each integer in list a and either the first or last integer in list b, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is the last integer in the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the first integer in list b, and diff2 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the last integer in list b.**
