Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing one tuple (-diff2, i, m - 1), `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the first integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the first integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`, and the absolute difference between the first integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`.**

In this output state, the only change is that `max_heap` is no longer empty and now contains a tuple with the negative value of `diff2`, the first integer `i` in list `a`, and the last index `m - 1` of list `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
