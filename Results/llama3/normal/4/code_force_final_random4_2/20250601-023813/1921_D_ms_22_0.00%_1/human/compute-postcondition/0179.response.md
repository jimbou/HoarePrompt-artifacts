Output State: **tp2 is either m - 2 or m - 4, ans is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value plus the absolute difference between the popped tuple's first element and the last integer in list b, all other variables remain unchanged**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line decrements `tp2` by 1, making it either `m - 2` or `m - 4`. The second line increments `ans` by `diff2`, which is the absolute difference between the popped tuple's first element and the last integer in list `b`. This makes `ans` greater than 0 and equal to its original value plus `diff2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
