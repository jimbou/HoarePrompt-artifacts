Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9, `max_heap` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple with the absolute differences between each integer in list `a` and either the first or last integer in list `b`, `tp1` is either 1 or 2, `tp2` is either `m - 1` or `m - 2`, `ans` is either the original value of `ans` minus the absolute difference between `item[1]` and either the first or last integer in list `b`, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`, `item` is the tuple with the maximum absolute difference between an integer in list `a` and either the first or last integer in list `b` has been removed from `max_heap` and assigned to `item` variable, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `tp1` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 1 or 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
