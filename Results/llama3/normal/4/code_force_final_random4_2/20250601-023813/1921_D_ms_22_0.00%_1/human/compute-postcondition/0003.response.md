Output State: **t is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0**

The code starts by decrementing the value of `t` by 1, reducing the number of test cases by one. Then, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, where `n` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and `m` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `n`. The code then reads `n` integers into the list `a`, and `m` integers into the list `b`, where each integer is between 1 and 10^9. The list `b` is then sorted in ascending order. The code initializes an empty list `max_heap`, and sets the variables `tp1` and `tp2` to 0 and `m - 1`, respectively. Finally, it sets the variable `ans` to 0.
