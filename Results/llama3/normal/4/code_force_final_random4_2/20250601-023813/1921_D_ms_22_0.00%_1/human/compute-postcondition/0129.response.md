The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and list `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`. So for the loop to be executed  the list `a` must have at least 1 integer and `i` is the first integer in the list `a`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the first integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the first integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`, `item` is `None`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and `ans` is printed**
