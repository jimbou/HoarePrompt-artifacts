Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is a non-empty list containing at least one tuples with the absolute differences between each integer in list a and either the first or last integer in list b, tp1 is either 0, 1 or 2, tp2 is either m - 1, m - 2 or m - 3, ans is either the original value of ans plus or minus the absolute difference between item[1] and either the first or last integer in list b, i is the last integer in the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the first integer in list b, and diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the last integer in list b, item is the tuple with the maximum absolute difference between an integer in list a and either the first or last integer in list b has been removed from max_heap and assigned to item variable, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code snippet calculates the absolute differences between the integer in the `item` tuple and the first and last integers in the sorted list `b`, and assigns these differences to `diff1` and `diff2`, respectively. The values of `diff1` and `diff2` are updated based on the values of `item[1]`, `b[tp1]`, and `b[tp2]`. No other variables are affected by the code snippet.
