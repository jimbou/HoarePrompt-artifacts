Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is the first integer in the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between the first integer in list a and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the first integer in list a and the last integer in list b.**

The code block consists of two lines, both of which assign new values to the variables diff1 and diff2. The first line calculates the absolute difference between the first integer in list a (i) and the first integer in list b (b[0]), and assigns this value to diff1. The second line calculates the absolute difference between the first integer in list a (i) and the last integer in list b (b[m - 1]), and assigns this value to diff2. 

All other variables remain unchanged.
