Postcondition: ***t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than 0, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is a list containing n - 1 tuples, either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 1) depending on whether diff1 is greater than diff2, tp1 is either 0 or 1, tp2 is either m - 1 or m - 2, ans is increased by the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the first integer in list b if the second element of the popped tuple item is less than tp1, otherwise it is increased by the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the last integer in list b, i is the index of the popped tuple, diff1 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the last integer in list b, item is the popped tuple, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and ans is printed. If item[2] is less than tp1 or greater than tp2, then tp1 is either 0 or 1, tp2 is either m - 1 or m - 2, ans is either the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the popped tuple's first element and the first integer in list b or greater than 0. If diff1 is greater than diff2, then tp1 is 1, ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the popped tuple's first element and the first integer in list b, and the current value of diff1 is the absolute difference between the popped tuple's first element and the first integer in list b. If diff1 is less than or equal to diff2, then tp2 is m - 2, ans is greater than 0, and the current value of diff1 is the absolute difference between the popped tuple's first element and the first integer in list b.***
