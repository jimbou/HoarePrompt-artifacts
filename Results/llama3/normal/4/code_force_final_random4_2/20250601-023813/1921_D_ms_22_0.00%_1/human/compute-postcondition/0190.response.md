Postcondition: **The program reads multiple test cases from stdin, each containing two integers n and m, and two lists of integers a and b. If the program is run as the main module, it calculates the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each integer in list a and the integers in list b, and prints this sum. After processing all test cases, stdin contains no test cases.**
