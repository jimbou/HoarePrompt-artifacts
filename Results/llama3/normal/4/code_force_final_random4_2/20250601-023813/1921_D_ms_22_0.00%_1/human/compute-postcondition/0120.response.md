Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9, `max_heap` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuples with the absolute differences between each integer in list `a` and either the first or last integer in list `b`, `tp1` is either 1, 2 or 3, `tp2` is either `m - 1`, `m - 2` or `m - 3`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` minus the maximum absolute difference between an integer in list `a` and either the first or last integer in list `b`, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`, `item` is the tuple with the maximum absolute difference between an integer in list `a` and either the first or last integer in list `b`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `tp1` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 1, 2, or 3. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
