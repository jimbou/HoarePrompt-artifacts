Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is a list containing one tuple with the absolute difference between the first integer in list a and either the first or last integer in list b, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is the first integer in the list a, and the absolute difference between the first integer in list a and the first or last integer in list b is stored in max_heap based on whether the absolute difference between the first integer in list a and the first integer in list b is greater than or less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first integer in list a and the last integer in list b.***
