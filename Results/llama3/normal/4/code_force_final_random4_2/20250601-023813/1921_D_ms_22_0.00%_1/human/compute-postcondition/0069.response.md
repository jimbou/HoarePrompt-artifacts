Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is a list containing one tuple (-diff1, i, 0), tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is the first integer in the list a, the current value of diff1 is the absolute difference between the first integer in list a and the first integer in list b, the current value of diff2 is the absolute difference between the first integer in list a and the last integer in list b, and the absolute difference between the first integer in list a and the first integer in list b is greater than the absolute difference between the first integer in list a and the last integer in list b.**

In natural language, the output state is: the value of t, n, m, a, b, tp1, tp2, ans, stdin, i, diff1, and diff2 remain the same as in the initial state. The max_heap now contains a tuple with the negative value of diff1, the first integer in list a, and 0.
