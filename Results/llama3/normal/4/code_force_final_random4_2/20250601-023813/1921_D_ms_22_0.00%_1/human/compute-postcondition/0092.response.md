Output State: **tp2 is m - 2, ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between item[1] and the last integer in list b, t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is a non-empty list containing n-1 tuples with the absolute differences between each integer in list a and either the first or last integer in list b, tp1 is 0, i is the last integer in the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the first integer in list b, and diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the last integer in list b, item is the tuple with the maximum absolute difference between an integer in list a and either the first or last integer in list b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `tp2` and `ans`. The first line decrements `tp2` by 1, making it `m - 2`. The second line increments `ans` by the value of `diff2`, which is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and the last integer in list `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
