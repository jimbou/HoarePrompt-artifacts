Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing one tuple (-diff2, i, m - 1), `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the first integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the first integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`. The absolute difference between the first integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`.**

In this output state, the `max_heap` list now contains one tuple, which is `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. The `diff2` value is the absolute difference between the first integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`. The `i` value is the first integer in the list `a`, and `m - 1` is the index of the last integer in list `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
