Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is a list containing two tuples with the absolute differences between the second integer in list a and either the first or last integer in list b, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is the second integer in the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between the second integer in list a and the first integer in list b, and diff2 is the absolute difference between the second integer in list a and the last integer in list b.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t is still greater than 0, n and m are still within their respective ranges and m is still greater than or equal to n. The lists a and b are still the same. The max_heap now contains two tuples, one with the absolute difference between the second integer in list a and the first integer in list b, and another with the absolute difference between the second integer in list a and the last integer in list b. The values of tp1, tp2, ans, and i are still the same. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one. The values of diff1 and diff2 are still the same.
