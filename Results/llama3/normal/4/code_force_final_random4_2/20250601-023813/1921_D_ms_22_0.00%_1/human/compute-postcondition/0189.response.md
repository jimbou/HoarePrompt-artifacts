Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is m, tp2 is 0, ans is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each integer in list a and the integers in list b, diff1 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the last integer in list b, and the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each integer in list a and the integers in list b which is ans is printed, and stdin contains no test cases.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable t will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variables n and m will retain their values from the last test case, representing the number of elements in lists a and b, respectively. List a will contain the elements from the last test case, and list b will be sorted in ascending order. The max_heap will be empty, and tp1 and tp2 will be reset to their initial values of m and 0, respectively. The variable ans will hold the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each integer in list a and the integers in list b, which will be printed as the final output. The variables diff1 and diff2 will hold the absolute differences between the last integer in list a and the first and last integers in list b, respectively. Finally, stdin will be empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
