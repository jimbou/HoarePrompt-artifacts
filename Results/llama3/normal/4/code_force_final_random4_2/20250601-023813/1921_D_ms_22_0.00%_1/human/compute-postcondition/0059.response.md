Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is an empty list, i is the last integer in the list, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap contains one less tuple than before, item is the tuple with the maximum value in max_heap before the operation, tp1 is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, tp2 is either m - 1, m - 2, m - 3 or m - 4, ans is either diff1 minus item[0] or diff1 minus item[0] minus item[0]. If diff1 <= diff2 and item[2] is either less than tp1 or greater than tp2, then item is either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 2), max_heap contains either n - 1 tuples (-diff2, i, m - 2) or n - 1 tuples (-diff1, i, 0), tp1 is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, tp2 is either m - 2, m - 3, m - 4 or m - 5, ans is either diff1 plus the original value of ans minus item[0] or the original value of ans plus diff2 minus item[0] minus item[0]. If diff1 <= diff2 and item[2] is greater than or equal to tp1 and less than or equal to tp2, then item is either (-diff1, i, 0) and max_heap contains n - 1 tuples (-diff2, i, m - 1) or (-diff2, i, m - 2), tp1 is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, tp2 is either m - 1, m - 2, m - 3 or m - 4, ans is either diff1 minus item[0] minus item[0] or the original value of ans plus diff2 minus item[0] minus item[0].***
