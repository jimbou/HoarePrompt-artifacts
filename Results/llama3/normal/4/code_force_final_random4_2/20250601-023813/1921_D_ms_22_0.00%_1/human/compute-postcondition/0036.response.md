Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `n`, `a` is an empty list, `i` is the last integer in the list, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9, `max_heap` contains `n - 1` tuples, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 2`, `ans` is either `diff1` or `diff2`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the second last integer in list `b`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, then `item` is (-`diff1`, `i`, 0) and `max_heap` contains `n - 1` tuples (-`diff2`, `i`, `m - 2`). Otherwise, `item` is (-`diff2`, `i`, `m - 2`) and `max_heap` contains `n - 1` tuples (-`diff1`, `i`, 0). Additionally, `item[2]` is greater than `tp1` and less than or equal to `tp2`.**

In this output state, the value of `tp2` has been decremented by 1, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged. The conditions and relationships between the variables are still valid, with the only change being the updated value of `tp2`.
