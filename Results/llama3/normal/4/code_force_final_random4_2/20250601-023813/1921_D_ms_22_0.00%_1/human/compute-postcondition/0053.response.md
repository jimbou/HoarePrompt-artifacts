Output State: **t is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is an empty list, i is the last integer in the list, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap contains one less tuple than before, item is the tuple with the maximum value in max_heap before the operation, tp1 is either 1, 2 or 3, tp2 is either m - 1, m - 2 or m - 3, ans is the original value of ans plus diff1, diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp1], diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp2].**

The code increments `tp1` by 1, making it either 1, 2, or 3. Then, it adds `diff1` to `ans`, updating its value to the original value of `ans` plus `diff1`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
