Postcondition: **t is greater than 0 minus 1, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is an empty list, i is the last integer in the list, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap contains at least one tuple minus one. If diff1 > diff2, then tp1 is 1, ans is diff1 plus the original value of ans, tp2 is either m - 1 or m - 2. If diff1 <= diff2, then tp1 is either 0 or 1, tp2 is either m - 2 or m - 3, ans is either diff1 + diff2 or the original value of ans plus 2 * diff2.**
