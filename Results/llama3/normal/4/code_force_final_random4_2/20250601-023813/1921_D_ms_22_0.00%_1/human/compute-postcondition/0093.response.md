Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is a non-empty list containing n-1 tuples with the absolute differences between each integer in list a and either the first or last integer in list b, tp1 is 1, tp2 is m - 1, ans is the absolute difference between item[1] and the first integer in list b, i is the last integer in the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the first integer in list b, and diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the last integer in list b, item is the tuple with the maximum absolute difference between an integer in list a and either the first or last integer in list b. The current value of item[2] is either less than tp1 or greater than tp2. The absolute difference between item[1] and the first integer in list b is greater than the absolute difference between item[1] and the last integer in list b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the absolute difference between item[1] and the first integer in list b is not greater than the absolute difference between item[1] and the last integer in list b, tp2 is m - 2, ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between item[1] and the last integer in list b.***
