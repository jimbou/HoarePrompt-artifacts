Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing two tuples, either (-diff1, i, 0) if diff1 is greater than diff2, or (-diff2, i, m - 1) if diff1 is less than or equal to diff2, and (-diff1, i, 0), `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the second integer in the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`, `item` is None, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and ans is printed.**

In this output state, the `max_heap` list now contains two tuples, the original tuple and the new tuple (-diff1, i, 0). The values of the other variables remain the same.
