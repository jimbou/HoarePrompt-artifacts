Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing two tuples, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, then `max_heap` contains two tuples (-`diff1`, `i`, 0) and (-`diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`). Otherwise, `max_heap` contains two tuples (-`diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`) and (-`diff1`, `i`, 0).**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 0 minus 1, and there are still multiple test cases minus one in the standard input. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` remain the same. The `max_heap` now contains two tuples, where the first tuple is either (-`diff1`, `i`, 0) or (-`diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`) depending on whether `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, and the second tuple is the other one. The values of `diff1` and `diff2` are still the absolute differences between the second integer in list `a` and the first and last integers in list `b`, respectively.
