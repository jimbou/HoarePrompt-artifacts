Output State: **t is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 that must have at least 3 integers, i is the third integer in the list, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is a list containing two tuples, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, diff1 is the absolute difference between the third integer in list a and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the third integer in list a and the last integer in list b. If diff1 > diff2, then max_heap contains two tuples (-diff1, i, 0) and (-diff2, i, m - 1). Otherwise, max_heap contains two tuples (-diff2, i, m - 1) and (-diff1, i, 0).**

The code snippet calculates the absolute differences between the third integer in list `a` and the first and last integers in list `b`, and assigns these values to `diff1` and `diff2`, respectively. The values of `diff1` and `diff2` are used to determine the contents of the `max_heap` list. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `max_heap` contains the tuples `(-diff1, i, 0)` and `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. Otherwise, it contains the tuples `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` and `(-diff1, i, 0)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
