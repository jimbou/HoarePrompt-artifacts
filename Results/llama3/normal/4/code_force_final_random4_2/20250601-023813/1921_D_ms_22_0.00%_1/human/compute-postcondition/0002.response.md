The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0.

State: **The program is running as the main module, `t` is greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The third line contains m integers b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9).**
