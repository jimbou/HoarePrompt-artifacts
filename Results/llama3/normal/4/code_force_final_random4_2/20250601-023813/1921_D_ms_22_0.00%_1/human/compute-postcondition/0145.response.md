Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 3 integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing three tuples, either (-diff1, i, 0), (-diff2, i, m - 1) and (-diff1, i, 0) if diff1 is greater than diff2, or (-diff2, i, m - 1), (-diff1, i, 0) and (-diff1, i, 0) if diff1 is less than or equal to diff2, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the third integer in the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the third integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the third integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`, `item` is None, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and ans is printed.***
