Output State: **t is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is an empty list, i is the last integer in the list, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap contains one less tuple than before, item is the tuple with the maximum value in max_heap before the operation, tp1 is either 0, 1 or 2, tp2 is either m - 2, m - 3 or m - 4, ans is the original value of ans plus diff2, diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp1], diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp2].**

In this output state, the only changes are that tp2 has been decremented by 1 and ans has been incremented by diff2. All other variables remain unchanged.
