Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than 0, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `n`, `a` is an empty list, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing `n - 1` tuples, either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 1) depending on whether `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b` if the second element of the popped tuple `item` is less than `tp1`, otherwise it is increased by the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`, `i` is the index of the popped tuple, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`, `item` is the popped tuple, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and `ans` is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b` if the second element of the popped tuple `item` is less than `tp1`, otherwise it is increased by the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
