Output State: **t is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is an empty list, i is the last integer in the list, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is m, tp2 is 0, ans is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each integer in list a and the integers in list b, diff1 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the last integer in list b.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the maximum heap is empty, and the pointers tp1 and tp2 have moved to the end of list b. The answer ans is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each integer in list a and the integers in list b. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
