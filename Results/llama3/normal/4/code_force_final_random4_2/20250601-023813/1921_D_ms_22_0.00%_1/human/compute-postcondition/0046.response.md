Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `n`, `a` is an empty list, `i` is the last integer in the list, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple minus one, `tp1` is either 1 or 2, `tp2` is either `m - 1` or `m - 2`, `ans` is either `diff1` minus `item[0]` or the original value of `ans` plus `diff2` minus `item[0]`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, then `item` is `(-diff1, i, 0)` and `max_heap` contains `n - 1` tuples `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, `tp1` is 2, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `diff1` minus `item[0]`. If `diff1` <= `diff2` and `item[2]` is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `item` is either `(-diff1, i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 2)`, `max_heap` contains either `n - 1` tuples `(-diff2, i, m - 2)` or `n - 1` tuples `(-diff1, i, 0)`, `tp1` is 1, `tp2` is `m - 2`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `diff2` minus `item[0]`. If `diff1` <= `diff2` and `item[2]` is greater than or equal to `tp1` and less than or equal to `tp2`, then `item` is either `(-diff1, i, 0)` and `max_heap` contains `n - 1` tuples `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 2)`.**

The value of `tp1` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `tp1` can now be either 1 or 2, depending on its previous value. The rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
