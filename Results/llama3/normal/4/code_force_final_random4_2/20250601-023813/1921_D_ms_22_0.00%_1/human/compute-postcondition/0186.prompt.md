Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `n`, `a` is an empty list, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples, either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 1) depending on whether `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is None, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`, `item` is None, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and `ans` is printed.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than 0, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is a list containing n - 1 tuples, either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 1) depending on whether diff1 is greater than diff2, tp1 is either 0 or 1, tp2 is either m - 1 or m - 2, ans is increased by the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the first integer in list b if the second element of the popped tuple item is less than tp1, otherwise it is increased by the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the last integer in list b, i is the index of the popped tuple, diff1 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the last integer in list b, item is the popped tuple, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and ans is printed. If item[2] is less than tp1 or greater than tp2, then tp1 is either 0 or 1, tp2 is either m - 1 or m - 2, ans is either the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the popped tuple's first element and the first integer in list b or greater than 0. If diff1 is greater than diff2, then tp1 is 1, ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the popped tuple's first element and the first integer in list b, and the current value of diff1 is the absolute difference between the popped tuple's first element and the first integer in list b. If diff1 is less than or equal to diff2, then tp2 is m - 2, ans is greater than 0, and the current value of diff1 is the absolute difference between the popped tuple's first element and the first integer in list b.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than 0, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is a list containing at least one tuple, either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 1) depending on whether diff1 is greater than diff2, tp1 is either 0, 1 or 2, tp2 is either m - 1, m - 2 or m - 3, ans is either the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the first integer in list b if the second element of the popped tuple item is less than tp1, otherwise it is increased by the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the last integer in list b, i is the index of the popped tuple, diff1 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the last integer in list b, item is the popped tuple, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and ans is printed. If item[2] is less than tp1 or greater than tp2, then tp1 is either 0, 1 or 2, tp2 is either m - 1, m - 2 or m - 3, ans is either the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the popped tuple's first element and the first integer in list b or greater than 0. If diff1 is greater than diff2, then tp1 is either 1 or 2, ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the popped tuple's first element and the first integer in list b, and the current value of diff1 is the absolute difference between the popped tuple's first element and the first integer in list b. If diff1 is less than or equal to diff2, then tp2 is m - 2, ans is greater than 0, and the current value of diff1 is the absolute difference between the popped tuple's first element and the first integer in list b.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than 0, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is a list containing at least one tuple, either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 1) depending on whether diff1 is greater than diff2, tp1 is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, tp2 is either m - 1, m - 2, m - 3 or m - 4, ans is increased by the absolute value of the first element of the popped tuple item, i is the index of the popped tuple, diff1 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the last integer in list b, item is the popped tuple, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and ans is printed. If item[2] is less than tp1 or greater than tp2, then tp1 is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, tp2 is either m - 1, m - 2, m - 3 or m - 4, ans is either the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the popped tuple's first element and the first integer in list b or greater than 0. If diff1 is greater than diff2, then tp1 is either 1, 2 or 3, ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the popped tuple's first element and the first integer in list b, and the current value of diff1 is the absolute difference between the popped tuple's first element and the first integer in list b. If diff1 is less than or equal to diff2, then tp2 is m - 2, ans is greater than 0, and the current value of diff1 is the absolute difference between the popped tuple's first element and the first integer in list b. If diff1 is greater than diff2, then tp1 is either 1, 2 or 3, ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the popped tuple's first element and the first integer in list b, and the current value of diff1 is the absolute difference between the popped tuple's first element and the first integer in list b. If diff1 is less than or equal to diff2, then tp2 is m - 2 or m - 4, ans is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value plus the absolute difference between the popped tuple's first element and the last integer in list b, and all other variables remain unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
