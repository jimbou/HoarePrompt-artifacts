Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9, `max_heap` is a non-empty list containing `n-1` tuples with the absolute differences between each integer in list `a` and either the first or last integer in list `b`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `item[0]`, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`, `item` is the tuple with the maximum absolute difference between an integer in list `a` and either the first or last integer in list `b`. The index of `item` is between `tp1` and `tp2` (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The current value of `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`***
