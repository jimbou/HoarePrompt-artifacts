Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `n`, `a` is an empty list, `i` is the last integer in the list, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9, `max_heap` contains `n - 1` tuples, `tp1` is 1, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is either `diff1` or `diff2`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, then `item` is (-`diff1`, `i`, 0) and `max_heap` contains `n - 1` tuples (-`diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`). Otherwise, `item` is (-`diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`) and `max_heap` contains `n - 1` tuples (-`diff1`, `i`, 0). Additionally, `item[2]` is greater than or equal to `tp1` and less than or equal to `tp2. The current value of `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`.**

In this output state, the value of `tp1` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and relationships between the variables are still valid, with the only change being the updated value of `tp1`.
