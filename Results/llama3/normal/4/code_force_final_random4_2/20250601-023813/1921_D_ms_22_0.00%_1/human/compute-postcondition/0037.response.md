Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is an empty list, i is the last integer in the list, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap contains n - 1 tuples, tp1 is either 0 or 1, tp2 is either m - 1 or m - 2, ans is either diff1 or diff2, diff1 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the last integer in list b or the second last integer in list b. If diff1 > diff2, then item is either (-diff1, i, 0) and max_heap contains n - 1 tuples (-diff2, i, m - 1) or (-diff2, i, m - 2). Otherwise, item is either (-diff2, i, m - 1) or (-diff2, i, m - 2) and max_heap contains n - 1 tuples (-diff1, i, 0). Additionally, item[2] is greater than or equal to tp1 and less than or equal to tp2.***
