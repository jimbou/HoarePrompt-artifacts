Output State: **The program is running as the main module, `t` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The third line contains m integers b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9).**

In this output state, the program is still running as the main module. The variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first test case, which is an integer. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one, since one test case has been read and processed. The remaining test cases still contain three lines each, with the same constraints on the values of n, m, a_i, and b_i.
