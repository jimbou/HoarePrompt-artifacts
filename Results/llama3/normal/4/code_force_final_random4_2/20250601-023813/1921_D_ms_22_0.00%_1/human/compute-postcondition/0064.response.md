The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than 0 minus 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **t is greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is an empty list, i is the last integer in the list, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is m, tp2 is 0, ans is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each integer in list a and the integers in list b, diff1 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the last integer in list b, and the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each integer in list a and the integers in list b which is ans is being printed**
