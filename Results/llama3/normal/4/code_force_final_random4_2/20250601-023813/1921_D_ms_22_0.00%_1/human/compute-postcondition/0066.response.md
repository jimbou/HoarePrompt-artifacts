The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If a is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, a is a list of n integers, so it is not empty. Therefore, the state of a does not need to be adjusted. However, the state of i needs to be adjusted to the first integer in the list a.
State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is the first integer in the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between the first integer in list a and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the first integer in list a and the last integer in list b**
