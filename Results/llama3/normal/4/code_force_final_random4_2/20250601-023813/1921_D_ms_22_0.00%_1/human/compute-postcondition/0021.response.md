Output State: **t is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is an empty list, i is the last integer in the list, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is a list containing n tuples, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, diff1 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the last integer in list b. If diff1 > diff2, then max_heap contains n tuples (-diff1, i, 0) and (-diff2, i, m - 1). Otherwise, max_heap contains n tuples (-diff2, i, m - 1) and (-diff1, i, 0).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `a` is empty, and the variable `i` is the last integer in the list `a`. The list `max_heap` contains `n` tuples, where each tuple is either `(-diff1, i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, depending on whether `diff1` is greater than `diff2` or not. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
