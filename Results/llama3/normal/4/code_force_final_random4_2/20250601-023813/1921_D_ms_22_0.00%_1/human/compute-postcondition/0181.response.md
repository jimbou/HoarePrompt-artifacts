Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than 0, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing at least one tuple, either `(-diff1, i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` depending on whether `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `tp1` is either 0, 1 or 2, `tp2` is either `m - 1, m - 2` or `m - 3`, `ans` is increased by the absolute value of the first element of the popped tuple `item`, `i` is the index of the popped tuple, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`, `item` is the popped tuple, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and `ans` is printed. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `tp1` is either 0, 1 or 2, `tp2` is either `m - 1, m - 2` or `m - 3`, `ans` is either the original value of `ans` plus the absolute difference between the popped tuple's first element and the first integer in list `b` or greater than 0. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, then `tp1` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the absolute difference between the popped tuple's first element and the first integer in list `b`, and the current value of `diff1` is the absolute difference between the popped tuple's first element and the first integer in list `b`. If `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`, then `tp2` is `m - 2`, `ans` is greater than 0, and the current value of `diff1` is the absolute difference between the popped tuple's first element and the first integer in list `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is increased by the absolute value of the first element of the popped tuple `item`. The values of other variables remain the same. The popped tuple `item` is removed from the `max_heap`. The value of `ans` is updated based on the first element of the popped tuple. The conditions for `tp1`, `tp2`, `diff1`, and `diff2` are updated accordingly.
