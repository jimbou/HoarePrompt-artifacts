Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is a non-empty list containing at least one tuples with the absolute differences between each integer in list a and either the first or last integer in list b, tp1 is either 1, 2 or 3, tp2 is either m - 1, m - 2 or m - 3, ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between item[1] and the first integer in list b, i is the last integer in the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the first integer in list b, and diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the last integer in list b, item is the tuple with the maximum absolute difference between an integer in list a and either the first or last integer in list b has been removed from max_heap and assigned to item variable, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this final state, the value of `tp1` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `ans` has been increased by the absolute difference between `item[1]` and the first integer in list `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
