Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is a list containing n tuples with the absolute differences between each integer in list a and either the first or last integer in list b, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is the last integer in the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the first integer in list b, and diff2 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the last integer in list b.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is a non-empty list containing n-1 tuples with the absolute differences between each integer in list a and either the first or last integer in list b, tp1 is either 0 or 1, tp2 is either m - 1 or m - 2, ans is either the absolute difference between item[1] and the first integer in list b or the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between item[1] and the last integer in list b or item[0], i is the last integer in the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the first integer in list b, and diff2 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the last integer in list b, item is the tuple with the maximum absolute difference between an integer in list a and either the first or last integer in list b. If the index of item is either less than tp1 or greater than tp2, the absolute difference between item[1] and the first integer in list b is greater than the absolute difference between item[1] and the last integer in list b, otherwise, the index of item is between tp1 and tp2 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9, `max_heap` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple with the absolute differences between each integer in list `a` and either the first or last integer in list `b`, `tp1` is either 0, 1 or 2, `tp2` is either `m - 1`, `m - 2` or `m - 3`, `ans` is either the original value of `ans` plus or minus the absolute difference between `item[1]` and either the first or last integer in list `b`, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`, `item` is the tuple with the maximum absolute difference between an integer in list `a` and either the first or last integer in list `b` has been removed from `max_heap` and assigned to `item` variable, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `tp1` is either 0, 1 or 2. Otherwise, if `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `tp1` is either 0 or 1 and `tp2` is either `m - 2` or `m - 3`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to n, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9, max_heap is a non-empty list containing at least one tuples with the absolute differences between each integer in list a and either the first or last integer in list b, tp1 is either 0, 1, 2, 3, tp2 is either m - 1, m - 2, m - 3, m - 4, ans is either the original value of ans plus or minus the absolute difference between item[1] and either the first or last integer in list b, i is the last integer in the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the first integer in list b, and diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the last integer in list b, item is the tuple with the maximum absolute difference between an integer in list a and either the first or last integer in list b has been removed from max_heap and assigned to item variable, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If item[2] is less than tp1 or greater than tp2, then tp1 is either 1, 2 or 3 if diff1 is greater than diff2, otherwise tp1 is either 0, 1 or 2, and tp2 is either m - 1, m - 2 or m - 3 if diff1 is greater than diff2, otherwise tp2 is either m - 2, m - 3 or m - 4. Otherwise, if item[2] equals tp1, then tp1 is either 1, 2 or 3, otherwise tp1 is either 0, 1 or 2, and tp2 is either m - 2, m - 3 or m - 4.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
