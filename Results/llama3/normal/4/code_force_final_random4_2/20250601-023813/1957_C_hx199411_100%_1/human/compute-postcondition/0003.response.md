The only variables in the loop head are variable `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `num` is 0, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 0**
