The only objects in the loop head are variables  i, m and range. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable m. If m is at least 3 the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value, n is an integer, k is greater than or equal to 0, m is either n-k-1 or n-2*k-1 and is not equal to 0 or 1, dp is a list of m+1 elements with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and dp[i] equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), num is either k or 2*k depending on whether c and r are equal or not for all iterations, i is equal to k, c is an integer from the input, r is an integer from the input, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus k+2. So for the loop to be executed  the m must be at least 3 and i is 3.
State: **t is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value, n is an integer, k is greater than or equal to 0, m is either n-k-1 or n-2*k-1 and is not equal to 0 or 1 and is at least 3, dp is a list of m+1 elements with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and dp[i] equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), num is either k or 2*k depending on whether c and r are equal or not for all iterations, i is equal to 3, c is an integer from the input, r is an integer from the input, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus k+2**
