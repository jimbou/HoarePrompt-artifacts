Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is 0, `num` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, `i` is equal to `k`, `c` and `r` are assigned the values of the last two integers from the input, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus `k+1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop counter `i` is equal to the number of iterations `k`, and the variables `c` and `r` hold the values of the last two integers from the input. The variable `num` has a value that depends on the number of times `c` was equal to `r` during the loop iterations. The other variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The loop has consumed `k+1` test cases from the input.
