To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are integers, `c` and `r` are assigned the values of the first two integers from the input, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 2, otherwise `num` is 3 or 4.**
