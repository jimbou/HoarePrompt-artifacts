Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is 0, `num` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, `i` is equal to `k`, `c` and `r` are assigned the values of the last two integers from the input, `m` is either `n-1`, `n-2`, `n-3`, `n-4`, `n-5`, or `n-6`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus `k+1`.**

In this output state, the value of `m` is calculated by subtracting `num` from `n`, resulting in six possible values for `m` depending on the value of `num`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still being greater than 0 and 1 less than its original value, `k` remaining 0, `i` equal to `k`, and `c` and `r` still assigned the values of the last two integers from the input. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus `k+1`.
