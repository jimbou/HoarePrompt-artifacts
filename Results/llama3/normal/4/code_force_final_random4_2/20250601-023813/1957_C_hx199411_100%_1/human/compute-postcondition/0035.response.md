The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `m` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 5 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be at least 5.
State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is 0, `num` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, `i` is 5, `c` and `r` are assigned the values of the last two integers from the input, `m` is either `n-1`, `n-2`, `n-3`, `n-4`, `n-5`, or `n-6`, `m` is not equal to 0, `m` is not equal to 1, `m` is at least 5, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k+1`, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, `dp[3]` equal to `(dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[2] * 2) % (10**9 + 7), `dp[4]` equal to `(dp[3] + (4 - 1) * dp[3] * 2) % (10**9 + 7)**
