Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is either `n-k-1` or `n-2*k-1` and is not equal to 0 or 1 and is at least 7, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, `dp[3]` equal to `(dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `dp[4]` equal to `(dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `dp[5]` equal to `(dp[4] + 4 * dp[3] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `dp[6]` equal to `(dp[5] + 5 * dp[4] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `dp[7]` equal to `(dp[6] + 6 * dp[5] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `num` is either `k` or `2*k` depending on whether `c` and `r` are equal or not for all iterations, `i` is equal to 7, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus `k+3`.**

The code updates the value of `dp[i]` for `i=7`, using the previously calculated values of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented to 7.
