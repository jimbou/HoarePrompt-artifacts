Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `i` is 0, `c` and `r` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `i` remain unchanged. The code assigns the values of `c` and `r` from the input, which is a space-separated list of integers. Since `stdin` initially contains multiple test cases minus one, after reading one test case, it now contains multiple test cases minus two.
