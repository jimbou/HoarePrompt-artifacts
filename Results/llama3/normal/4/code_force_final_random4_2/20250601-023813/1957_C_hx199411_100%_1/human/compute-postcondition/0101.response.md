Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and is greater than 0, `m` is either `n-k-1` or `n-2*k-1`, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, and `dp[i]` equal to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `num` is either 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, `i` is 2, `c` is an integer and is equal to the first input, `r` is an integer and is equal to the second input, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k+6` if `m` is 1, otherwise `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k+m+4`. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is either 2, 3, 4 or 5. Otherwise, `num` is either 3, 4, 5 or 6.**
