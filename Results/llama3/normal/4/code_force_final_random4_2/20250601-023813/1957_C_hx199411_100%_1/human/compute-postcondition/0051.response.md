The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 1, `m` is either `n-1`, `n-2`, `n-3`, `n-4`, `n-5`, or `n-6`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k+3`. If `m` is 0, the number 1 is being printed. If `m` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. Otherwise, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, and `dp[i]` equal to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. `num` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `c` and `r` are equal or not, and `i` is 1**
