Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and is greater than 0, `m` is either `n-k-1` or `n-2*k-1`, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, and `dp[i]` equal to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `num` is 0, `i` is 0, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `c` is not equal to `r`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k+4` if `m` is 1, otherwise `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k+m+2`.***
