The code accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= n) on the first line, and k lines of two integers r_i and c_i each. The first line of the first test case is read and assigned to `t`. Therefore, the remaining test cases are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= n) on the first line, and k lines of two integers r_i and c_i each.**
