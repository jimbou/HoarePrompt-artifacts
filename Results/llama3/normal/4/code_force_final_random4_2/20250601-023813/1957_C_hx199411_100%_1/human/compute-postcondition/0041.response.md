Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is 0, `num` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, `i` is equal to `k` if `m` is not 0, otherwise `i` is equal to `m`, `c` and `r` are assigned the values of the last two integers from the input, `m` is either `n-1`, `n-2`, `n-3`, `n-4`, `n-5`, or `n-6`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus `k+1`. If `m` is 0, the number 1 is being printed. If `m` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. Otherwise, dp is a list of `m+1` elements with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and dp[i] equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7).**
