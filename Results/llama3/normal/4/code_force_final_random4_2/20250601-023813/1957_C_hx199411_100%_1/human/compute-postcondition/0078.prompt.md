Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value, n is an integer, k is greater than or equal to 0, m is either n-k-1 or n-2*k-1 and is not equal to 0 or 1, dp is a list of m+1 elements with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and dp[i] equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), num is either k or 2*k depending on whether c and r are equal or not for all iterations, i is equal to k, c is an integer from the input, r is an integer from the input, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus k+2.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(3, m + 1):
    dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value, n is an integer, k is greater than or equal to 0, m is either n-k-1 or n-2*k-1 and is not equal to 0 or 1 and is at least 3, dp is a list of m+1 elements with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and dp[i] equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) for i=3, num is either k or 2*k depending on whether c and r are equal or not for all iterations, i is equal to 3, c is an integer from the input, r is an integer from the input, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus k+2

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is either `n-k-1` or `n-2*k-1` and is not equal to 0 or 1 and is at least 4, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, and `dp[i]` equal to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` for `i=3` to `i=5`, `num` is either `k` or `2*k` depending on whether `c` and `r` are equal or not for all iterations, `i` is equal to 5, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus `k+3`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is either `n-k-1` or `n-2*k-1` and is not equal to 0 or 1 and is at least 7, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, `dp[3]` equal to `(dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `dp[4]` equal to `(dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `dp[5]` equal to `(dp[4] + 4 * dp[3] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `dp[6]` equal to `(dp[5] + 5 * dp[4] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `dp[7]` equal to `(dp[6] + 6 * dp[5] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `num` is either `k` or `2*k` depending on whether `c` and `r` are equal or not for all iterations, `i` is equal to 7, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus `k+3`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
