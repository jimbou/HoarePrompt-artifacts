Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0, `m` is either `n-k-1` or `n-2*k-1` and is not equal to 0, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, and `dp[i]` equal to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `num` is either `k` or `2*k` depending on whether `c` and `r` are equal or not for all iterations, `i` is equal to `k`, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k+2`.***
