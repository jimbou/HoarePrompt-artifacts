The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value. So for the loop to be executed one more time the original value of t needed to have been equal or greater than 3 and t currently must be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 3 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0, `m` is either `n-k-1` or `n-2*k-1`, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, and `dp[i]` equal to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `num` is either `k` or `2*k` depending on whether `c` and `r` are equal or not for all iterations, `i` is equal to `k` if `m` is 1, otherwise `i` is equal to `m`, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k+2` if `m` is 1, otherwise `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k+m`.**
