Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is 0, `num` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, `i` is 4, `c` and `r` are assigned the values of the last two integers from the input, `m` is either `n-1`, `n-2`, `n-3`, `n-4`, `n-5`, or `n-6`, `m` is not equal to 0, `m` is not equal to 1, `m` is at least 4, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k+1`, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, `dp[3]` equal to `(dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[2] * 2) % (10**9 + 7)`, `dp[4]` equal to `(dp[3] + (4 - 1) * dp[3] * 2) % (10**9 + 7)`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains the same, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `num` still has six possible values, `i` is still 4, `c` and `r` are still assigned the last two integers from the input, `m` still has six possible values and is at least 4, the number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 1, and the `dp` list now has an additional element at index 4, which is calculated based on the previous elements.
