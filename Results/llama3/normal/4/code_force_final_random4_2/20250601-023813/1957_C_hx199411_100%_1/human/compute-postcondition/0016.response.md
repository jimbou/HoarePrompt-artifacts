Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num` is either 2, 3 or 4, `c` and `r` are assigned the values of the first two integers from the input, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four.**

The code assigns the values of the first two integers from the input to `c` and `r`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The state of `num` is still dependent on the values of `c` and `r`, which are now assigned new values from the input. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus four, since two integers have been read from the input.
