Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0, `m` is either `n-1`, `n-2`, `n-3`, `n-4`, `n-5`, or `n-6`, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, and `dp[i]` equal to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `num` is either `k` or `2*k` depending on whether `c` and `r` are equal or not for all iterations, `i` is equal to `k`, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k+2`. If `m` is 0, the number 1 is being printed. If `m` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. Otherwise, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, and `dp[i]` equal to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` remains greater than 0 and 2 less than its original value, `n` remains an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is either `n-1`, `n-2`, `n-3`, `n-4`, `n-5`, or `n-6`, and `dp` remains a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, and `dp[i]` equal to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. The value of `num` depends on whether `c` and `r` are equal or not for all iterations, and `i` is equal to `k`. The values of `c` and `r` are integers from the input, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k+2`. If `m` is 0 or 1, the number 1 is being printed. Otherwise, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, and `dp[i]` equal to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.
