Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and is greater than 0, `m` is either `n-k-1` or `n-2*k-1`, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, and `dp[i]` equal to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `num` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 1, `c` is an integer and is equal to the first input, `r` is an integer and is equal to the second input, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k+5` if `m` is 1, otherwise `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k+m+3`, and `num` is 1 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `num` is 2**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `dp`, `num`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The values of `c` and `r` are updated to the first and second inputs, respectively. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 1, and the condition for `num` is updated based on the values of `c` and `r`.
