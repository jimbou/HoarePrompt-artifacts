Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is either 3 or 4, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are integers, `c` and `r` are assigned the values of the first two integers from the input, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to be either 3 or 4, as it was initially either 1 or 2 and has been incremented by 2. The other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still being greater than 0 and 1 less than its original value, `n` still being an integer, `k` still being greater than 0, `i` still being 1, and `c` and `r` still being integers assigned the values of the first two integers from the input. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three.
