Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. It takes into account the number of moves already played, the size of the chessboard, and the fact that the computer mirrors the player's moves.

The program first calculates the number of rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks, which is stored in the variable `num`. It then calculates the number of remaining rows and columns that are available for placing rooks, which is stored in the variable `m`.

The program then uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of different final configurations possible. The dynamic programming array `dp` is used to store the number of configurations possible for each number of remaining rows and columns. The base cases are when there is only one or two remaining rows and columns, in which case there is only one or three possible configurations, respectively.

For larger numbers of remaining rows and columns, the program calculates the number of configurations possible by considering two cases: when the player places a rook in a row or column that is not occupied by the computer's rook, and when the player places a rook in a row or column that is occupied by the computer's rook. In the first case, the number of configurations possible is the same as the number of configurations possible for the remaining rows and columns minus one. In the second case, the number of configurations possible is twice the number of configurations possible for the remaining rows and columns minus two.

The program finally prints the number of configurations possible for the given number of remaining rows and columns, modulo 10^9 + 7.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when the number of remaining rows and columns is zero, one, or two, and when the player places a rook in a row or column that is occupied by the computer's rook. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
