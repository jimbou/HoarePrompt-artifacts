Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value, n is an integer, k is an integer and is greater than or equal to 0, m is either n-k-1 or n-2*k-1, dp is a list of m+1 elements with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and dp[i] equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), num is 0, i is equal to k if m is 1, otherwise i is equal to m, stdin contains multiple test cases minus k+3 if m is 1, otherwise stdin contains multiple test cases minus k+m+1.**

The code first decrements `t` by 1, reducing its value by 1. Then, it reads two integers from the input, assigning them to `n` and `k`, respectively. The value of `num` is set to 0. The values of `m`, `dp`, `i`, `c`, and `r` are not directly modified by the code, but their values are constrained by the initial state. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by `k+2` if `m` is 1, or by `k+m` otherwise.
