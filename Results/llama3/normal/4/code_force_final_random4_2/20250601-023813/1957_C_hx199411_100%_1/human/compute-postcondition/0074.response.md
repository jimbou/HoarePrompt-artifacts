The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 4.
State: **t is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value, n is an integer, k is greater than or equal to 0, m is either n-k-1 or n-2*k-1 and is not equal to 0 or 1 and is at least 4, dp is a list of m+1 elements with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and dp[i] equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) for i=3, num is either k or 2*k depending on whether c and r are equal or not for all iterations, i is equal to 4, c is an integer from the input, r is an integer from the input, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus k+2**
