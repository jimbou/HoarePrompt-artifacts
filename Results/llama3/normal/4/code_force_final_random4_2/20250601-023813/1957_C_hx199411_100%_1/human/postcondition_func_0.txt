This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k, followed by k lines of two integers each. It calculates the number of ways to arrange the integers in a specific pattern, depending on the values of n and k. If m (n minus the number of pairs with equal integers) is 0 or 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to arrange the integers and prints the result. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed.
