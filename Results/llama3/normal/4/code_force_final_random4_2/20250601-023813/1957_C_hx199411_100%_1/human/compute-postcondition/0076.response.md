The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 5, `m` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 6 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 6.
State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is either `n-k-1` or `n-2*k-1` and is not equal to 0 or 1 and is at least 7, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, and `dp[i]` equal to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` for `i=3` to `i=6`, `num` is either `k` or `2*k` depending on whether `c` and `r` are equal or not for all iterations, `i` is equal to 6, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus `k+3`.**
