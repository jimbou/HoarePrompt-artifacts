Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are assigned the values of the first two integers from the input, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is either 3, 4 or 5. Otherwise, `num` is either 4, 5 or 6.***
