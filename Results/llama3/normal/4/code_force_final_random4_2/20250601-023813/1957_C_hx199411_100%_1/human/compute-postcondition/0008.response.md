Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is 2, `i` is 0, `c` and `r` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and `c` is not equal to `r`**

The code increments the value of `num` by 2. Since the initial value of `num` was 0, its new value is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The state of the input stream also remains the same, with multiple test cases minus two still available. The condition that `c` is not equal to `r` is still valid.
