Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 2, `m` is either `n-1`, `n-2`, `n-3`, `n-4`, `n-5`, or `n-6`, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, and `dp[i]` equal to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `num` is either 4 or 5 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `num` is either 5 or 6, `i` is 2, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k+6`.**

The value of `num` is incremented by 2. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` was either 2 or 3, so it is now either 4 or 5. Otherwise, `num` was either 3 or 4, so it is now either 5 or 6. The states of the other variables are not affected.
