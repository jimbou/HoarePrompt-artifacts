Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 2, `m` is either `n-1`, `n-2`, `n-3`, `n-4`, `n-5`, or `n-6`, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, and `dp[i]` equal to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `num` is either 3 or 4 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `num` is either 4 or 5, `i` is 2, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k+6`.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been incremented by 1. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` was either 2 or 3, so now it is either 3 or 4. If `c` is not equal to `r`, then `num` was either 3 or 4, so now it is either 4 or 5. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
