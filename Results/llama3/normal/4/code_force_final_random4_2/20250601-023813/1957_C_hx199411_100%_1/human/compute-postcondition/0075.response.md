Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is either `n-k-1` or `n-2*k-1` and is not equal to 0 or 1 and is at least 4, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, and `dp[i]` equal to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` for `i=3` to `i=5`, `num` is either `k` or `2*k` depending on whether `c` and `r` are equal or not for all iterations, `i` is equal to 5, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus `k+3`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains the same, `n`, `k`, `m`, `num`, `c`, and `r` also remain unchanged. The list `dp` has been updated with a new value at index `i=5` using the given formula. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The stdin still contains multiple test cases but with `k+3` inputs consumed.
