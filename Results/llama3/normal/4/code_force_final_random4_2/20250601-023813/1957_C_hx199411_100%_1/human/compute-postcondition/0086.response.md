Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and is greater than 0, `m` is either `n-k-1` or `n-2*k-1`, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, and `dp[i]` equal to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `num` is 0, `i` is 0, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k+4` if `m` is 1, otherwise `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k+m+2`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `dp`, `num`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The code assigns the values of `c` and `r` to the integers read from the input, which are now part of the state. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 1, since one test case has been read.
