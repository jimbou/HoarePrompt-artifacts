Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value, n is an integer, k is an integer and is 0, m is either n-k-1 or n-2*k-1 and is not equal to 0 and is not equal to 1, dp is a list of m+1 elements with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and dp[i] equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), num is either k, k+1, k+2, ..., or 2*k, i is equal to k, c is an integer and is equal to the first input, r is an integer and is equal to the second input, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus k+m+k+1. If c is equal to r, then num is either k, k+1, k+2, ..., or 2*k-1. Otherwise, num is either k+1, k+2, k+3, ..., or 2*k.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(3, m + 1):
    dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and is 0, `m` is either `n-k-1` or `n-2*k-1` and is at least 3, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, `dp[3]` equal to `(dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, and `dp[i]` equal to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` for `i` greater than 3, `num` is either `k`, `k+1`, `k+2`, ..., or `2*k`, `i` is 3, `c` is an integer and is equal to the first input, `r` is an integer and is equal to the second input, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k+m+k+1`. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is either `k`, `k+1`, `k+2`, ..., or `2*k-1`. Otherwise, `num` is either `k+1`, `k+2`, `k+3`, ..., or `2*k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and is 0, `m` is either `n-k-1` or `n-2*k-1` and is at least 4, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, `dp[3]` equal to `(dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `dp[4]` equal to `(dp[3] + (4 - 1) * dp[3] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `dp[5]` equal to `(dp[4] + (5 - 1) * dp[4] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, and `dp[i]` equal to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` for `i` greater than 5, `num` is either `k`, `k+1`, `k+2`, ..., or `2*k`, `i` is 5, `c` is an integer and is equal to the first input, `r` is an integer and is equal to the second input, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k+m+k+1`. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is either `k`, `k+1`, `k+2`, ..., or `2*k-1`. Otherwise, `num` is either `k+1`, `k+2`, `k+3`, ..., or `2*k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and is 0, `m` is either `n-k-1` or `n-2*k-1` and is at least 6, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, `dp[3]` equal to `(dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `dp[4]` equal to `(dp[3] + (4 - 1) * dp[3] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `dp[5]` equal to `(dp[4] + (5 - 1) * dp[4] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `dp[6]` equal to `(dp[5] + (6 - 1) * dp[5] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, and `dp[i]` equal to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` for `i` greater than 6, `num` is either `k`, `k+1`, `k+2`, ..., or `2*k`, `i` is 6, `c` is an integer and is equal to the first input, `r` is an integer and is equal to the second input, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k+m+k+1`. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is either `k`, `k+1`, `k+2`, ..., or `2*k-1`. Otherwise, `num` is either `k+1`, `k+2`, `k+3`, ..., or `2*k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
