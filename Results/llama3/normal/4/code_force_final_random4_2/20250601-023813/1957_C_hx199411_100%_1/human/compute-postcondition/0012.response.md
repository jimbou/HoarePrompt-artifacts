Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is either 2 or 3, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are integers, `c` and `r` are assigned the values of the first two integers from the input, `num` is 2 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `num` is 3, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been incremented by 1. Since `num` was either 1 or 2 initially, it is now either 2 or 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `num` is 1 if `c` is equal to `r` and 2 otherwise has been updated to `num` is 2 if `c` is equal to `r` and 3 otherwise. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three.
