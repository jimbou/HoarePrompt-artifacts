Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num` is either 4, 5 or 6, `c` and `r` are assigned the values of the first two integers from the input, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four.**

The value of `num` is increased by 2. Since `num` was either 2, 3, or 4, it is now either 4, 5, or 6. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus four.
