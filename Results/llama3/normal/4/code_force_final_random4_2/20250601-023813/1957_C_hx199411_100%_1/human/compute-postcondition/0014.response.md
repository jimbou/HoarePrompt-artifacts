Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are integers, `c` and `r` are assigned the values of the first two integers from the input, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 2, otherwise `num` is 3 or 4.***
