Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and is 0, `m` is either `n-k-1` or `n-2*k-1` and is at least `m`, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, and `dp[i]` equal to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` for `i` greater than or equal to 3, `num` is either `k`, `k+1`, `k+2`, ..., or `2*k`, `i` is `m`, `c` is an integer and is equal to the first input, `r` is an integer and is equal to the second input, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k+m+k+1`. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is either `k`, `k+1`, `k+2`, ..., or `2*k-1`. Otherwise, `num` is either `k+1`, `k+2`, `k+3`, ..., or `2*k`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the list `dp` has been fully populated up to index `m` using the recurrence relation `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, and the loop counter `i` has reached its final value `m`. The other variables remain unchanged.
