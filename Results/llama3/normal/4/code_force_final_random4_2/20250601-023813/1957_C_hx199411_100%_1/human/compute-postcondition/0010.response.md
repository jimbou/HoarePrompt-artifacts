To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.

The state of `k` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables, `t`, `n`, `num`, `c`, and `r`, are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are integers, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 1; otherwise, `num` is 2.**
