Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value, n is an integer, k is greater than or equal to 0, m is either n-k-1 or n-2*k-1 and is not equal to 0 or 1 and is at least 3, dp is a list of m+1 elements with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and dp[i] equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) for i=3, num is either k or 2*k depending on whether c and r are equal or not for all iterations, i is equal to 3, c is an integer from the input, r is an integer from the input, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus k+2**

The code updates the value of dp[i] where i is equal to 3. The new value of dp[3] is calculated using the previous values of dp[2] and dp[1]. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus k+2.
