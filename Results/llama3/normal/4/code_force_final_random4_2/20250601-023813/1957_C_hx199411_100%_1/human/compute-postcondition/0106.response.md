Output: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and is 0, `m` is 0, `dp` is a list of 1 elements with `dp[0]` equal to 0, `num` is either `k`, `k+1`, `k+2`, ..., or `2*k`, `i` is equal to `k`, `c` is an integer and is equal to the first input, `r` is an integer and is equal to the second input, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k+k+1`. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is either `k`, `k+1`, `k+2`, ..., or `2*k-1`. Otherwise, `num` is either `k+1`, `k+2`, `k+3`, ..., or `2*k`. The number 1 is being printed**
