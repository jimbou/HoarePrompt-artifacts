Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to arrange the integers in a specific pattern, depending on the values of n and k. It handles the base cases where m (n minus the number of pairs with equal integers) is 0 or 1 correctly, and it uses the correct recurrence relation to calculate the number of ways to arrange the integers for larger values of m. The program also correctly handles the modulo operation to prevent overflow.

Correctness: **True**
