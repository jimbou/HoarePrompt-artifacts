Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num` is either 3, 4 or 5, `c` and `r` are assigned the values of the first two integers from the input, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 3, 4, or 5. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus four.
