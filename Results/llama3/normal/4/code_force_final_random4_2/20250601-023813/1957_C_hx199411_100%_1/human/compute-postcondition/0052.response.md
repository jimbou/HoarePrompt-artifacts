Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 1, `m` is either `n-1`, `n-2`, `n-3`, `n-4`, `n-5`, or `n-6`, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, and `dp[i]` equal to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `num` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `c` and `r` are equal or not, `i` is 1, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k+4`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `dp`, `num`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The code only updates the values of `c` and `r`, which are now integers read from the input. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 1.
