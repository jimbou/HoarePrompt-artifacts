Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= n) on the first line, and k lines of two integers r_i and c_i each.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    num = 0
    for i in range(k):
        c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if c == r:
            num += 1
        else:
            num += 2
    m = n - num
    if m == 0:
        print(1)
    elif m == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
        dp[1] = 1
        dp[2] = 3
        for i in range(3, m + 1):
            dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
        print(dp[m])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is 0, `num` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, `i` is equal to `k` if `m` is not 0, otherwise `i` is equal to `m`, `c` and `r` are assigned the values of the last two integers from the input, `m` is either `n-1`, `n-2`, `n-3`, `n-4`, `n-5`, or `n-6`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus `k+1`. If `m` is 0, the number 1 is being printed. If `m` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. Otherwise, dp is a list of `m+1` elements with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and dp[i] equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7).
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0, `m` is either `n-k-1` or `n-2*k-1`, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, and `dp[i]` equal to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `num` is either `k` or `2*k` depending on whether `c` and `r` are equal or not for all iterations, `i` is equal to `k` if `m` is 1, otherwise `i` is equal to `m`, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k+2` if `m` is 1, otherwise `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k+m`. If `m` is 0 or 1, the number 1 is being printed. Otherwise, the program prints the value of `dp[m]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and is 0, `m` is either `n-k-1` or `n-2*k-1`, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, and `dp[i]` equal to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `num` is either `k`, `k+1`, `k+2`, ..., or `2*k`, `i` is equal to `k`, `c` is an integer and is equal to the first input, `r` is an integer and is equal to the second input, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k+k+1` if `m` is 1, otherwise `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k+m+k+1`. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is either `k`, `k+1`, `k+2`, ..., or `2*k-1`. Otherwise, `num` is either `k+1`, `k+2`, `k+3`, ..., or `2*k`. If `m` is 0, then the number 1 is being printed. If `m` is 1, then the number 1 is being printed. Otherwise, the value of `dp[m]` is being printed, where `dp[m]` is equal to `(dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
