Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are integers, `c` and `r` are assigned the values of the first two integers from the input, `num` is 1 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `num` is 2, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `c` and `r` are updated to the first two integers from the input. The value of `num` is determined based on the values of `c` and `r`. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 1; otherwise, `num` is 2. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus three.
