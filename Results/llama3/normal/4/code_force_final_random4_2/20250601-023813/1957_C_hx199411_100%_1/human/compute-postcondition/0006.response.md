Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is 1, `i` is 0, `c` and `r` are integers and `c` is equal to `r`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

The value of `num` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two. The relationship between `c` and `r` remains the same, i.e., `c` is equal to `r`.
