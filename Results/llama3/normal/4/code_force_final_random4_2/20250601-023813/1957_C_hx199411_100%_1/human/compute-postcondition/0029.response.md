Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `k` is 0, `num` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, `i` is equal to `k`, `c` and `r` are assigned the values of the last two integers from the input, `m` is either `n-1`, `n-2`, `n-3`, `n-4`, `n-5`, or `n-6`, `m` is not equal to 0, `m` is not equal to 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus `k+1`***
