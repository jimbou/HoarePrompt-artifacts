The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `q`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q`. If `q` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `q` is an integer between 1 and 1000, which ensures that the loop will execute, so `q` does not need to be adjusted. However, `i` needs to be adjusted to 0, which is the starting value of the range.
State: **`q` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `mn` is 100, `i` is 0, stdin contains t lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9)**
