Output State: **q is an integer between 1 and 1000, mn is 100, stdin contains t lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9).**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `q`. Since the input is between 1 and 1000, `q` becomes an integer in this range. The second line assigns the value 100 to `mn`. No other variables are affected. The state of stdin remains the same, containing t lines each with three digits a, b, c.
