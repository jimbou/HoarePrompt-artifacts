Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than 1, `mn` is 100, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, stdin contains t-2 lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If the current values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are such that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, if `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then 'STAIR' is printed. In all other cases, 'NONE' is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `q`, `mn`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the next set of three digits from the input, which are between 0 and 9. The stdin now contains t-2 lines of input, as one line has been consumed by the `input()` function. The conditions for printing 'PEAK', 'STAIR', or 'NONE' remain the same, based on the updated values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
