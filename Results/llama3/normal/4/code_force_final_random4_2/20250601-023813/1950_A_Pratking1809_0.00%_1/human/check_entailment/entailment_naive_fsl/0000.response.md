Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input is 1 2 1, the program will print "STAIR" and "NONE", but the correct output should be only "NONE". This is because the program has two separate if statements for "STAIR" and "PEAK", and if the condition for "STAIR" is met, it will print "STAIR" regardless of whether the condition for "PEAK" is also met. 

To fix this, the program should use elif statements instead of separate if statements, so that it only checks for "PEAK" if the condition for "STAIR" is not met. 

Here is the corrected code:

```
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```
