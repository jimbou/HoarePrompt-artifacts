Output: **`q` is an integer greater than 2, `mn` is 100, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, `a`, `b`, `c` are the values of the first line of stdin, stdin contains t-4 lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If the current values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are such that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. In all other cases, 'NONE' is printed. and 'STAIR' is printed**
