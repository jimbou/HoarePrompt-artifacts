Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) â€” the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9).
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: q is 0, mn is 100, i is q, a, b, c are integers between 0 and 9, stdin is empty. If the current values of a, b, and c are such that a is less than b and b is less than c, then 'STAIR' is printed. If a is less than b and b is greater than c, then 'PEAK' is printed. In all other cases, 'NONE' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of three-digit numbers from standard input, classifies each number as either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the relative values of its digits, and prints the classification for each number. It does not return any value or modify any external state, and its only effect is the output printed to the console.
