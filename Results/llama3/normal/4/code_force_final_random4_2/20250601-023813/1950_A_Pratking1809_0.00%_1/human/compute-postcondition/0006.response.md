Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `mn` is 100, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, stdin contains t-1 lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If the current values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are such that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then 'STAIR' is printed. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
