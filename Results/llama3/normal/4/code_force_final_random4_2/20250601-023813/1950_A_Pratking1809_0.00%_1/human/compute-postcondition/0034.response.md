Output State: **q is 0, mn is 100, i is q, a, b, c are integers between 0 and 9, stdin is empty. If the current values of a, b, and c are such that a is less than b and b is less than c, then 'STAIR' is printed. If a is less than b and b is greater than c, then 'PEAK' is printed. In all other cases, 'NONE' is printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of q will be 0, mn will still be 100, and i will be equal to the initial value of q. The variables a, b, and c will still be integers between 0 and 9, but their values will be the values of the last line of stdin. Stdin will be empty because all lines have been read. The loop will have printed 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each line of stdin, depending on the values of a, b, and c.
