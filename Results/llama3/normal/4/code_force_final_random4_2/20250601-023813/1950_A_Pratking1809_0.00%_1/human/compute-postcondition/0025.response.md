Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than 2, `mn` is 100, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, `a`, `b`, `c` are the values of the first line of stdin, stdin contains t-4 lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If the current values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are such that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. In all other cases, 'NONE' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `q`, `mn`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the first line of the input, which contains three digits between 0 and 9. The remaining input lines are reduced by one. The conditions for printing 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' still apply based on the updated values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
