Reasoning:

The given program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to determine whether three digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. The program uses two conditional statements to check for the conditions of a stair (a < b < c) and a peak (a < b > c). If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE". The program also correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

However, there is a minor issue with the program. The variable `mn` is declared but not used anywhere in the program. This does not affect the correctness of the program but is unnecessary code.

Correctness: **True**
