Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, arr is a list of non-negative integers of length at least right + 1, cliquess is a list of non-negative integers of length at least right + 1, clique is a non-negative integer, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is greater than or equal to 0, not_mid is at least 1, i is mid, arr[left + mid - i - 1] is small_element + i, cliquess[left + i] is clique, arr[left + mid + i] is big_element - i, cliquess[left + mid + i] is clique**
