Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, arr is a list of non-negative integers of length at least right + 1, cliquess is a list of non-negative integers of length at least right + 1, clique is a non-negative integer, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is greater than 0, not_mid is right - left + 1 - mid, i is 0, arr[left + mid - i - 1] is small_element + i, cliquess[left + i] is clique**

The code modifies the values of `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` and `cliquess[left + i]`. The first line assigns the value of `small_element + i` to `arr[left + mid - i - 1]`, and the second line assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + i]`. The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`, and `i` remain unchanged. The length and type of `arr` and `cliquess` also remain unchanged.
