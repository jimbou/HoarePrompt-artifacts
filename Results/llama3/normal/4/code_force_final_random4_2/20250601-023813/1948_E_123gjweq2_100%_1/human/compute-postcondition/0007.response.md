Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, arr is a list of non-negative integers of length at least right + 1, cliquess is a list of non-negative integers of length at least right + 1, clique is a non-negative integer, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is greater than or equal to 0, not_mid is right - left + 1 - mid, i is mid, arr[left + mid - i - 1] is small_element + i, cliquess[left + i] is clique**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the values of the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The loop has iterated `mid` times, and the values of `arr` and `cliquess` have been updated at the corresponding indices. The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, and `big_element` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
