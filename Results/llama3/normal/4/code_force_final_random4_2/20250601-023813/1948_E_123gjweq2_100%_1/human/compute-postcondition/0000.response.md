Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, arr is a list of non-negative integers of length at least right + 1, cliquess is a list of non-negative integers of length at least right + 1, clique is a non-negative integer, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, and not_mid is right - left + 1 - ((right - left + 1) // 2).**

The code assigns `left + 1` to `small_element` and `right + 1` to `big_element`. It then calculates `mid` as half of the difference between `big_element` and `small_element` plus one, which simplifies to `(right - left + 1) // 2`. Finally, it calculates `not_mid` as the total range (`right - left + 1`) minus `mid`. The values of `left`, `right`, `arr`, `cliquess`, and `clique` remain unchanged.
