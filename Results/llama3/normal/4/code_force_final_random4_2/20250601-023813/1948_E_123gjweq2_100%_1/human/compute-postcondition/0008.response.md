According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `not_mid`. If `not_mid` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`, so we need to adjust `not_mid` to be at least 1.

State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers of length at least `right` + 1, `cliquess` is a list of non-negative integers of length at least `right` + 1, `clique` is a non-negative integer, `small_element` is `left` + 1, `big_element` is `right` + 1, `mid` is greater than or equal to 0, `not_mid` is at least 1, `i` is `mid`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `small_element` + `i`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`**
