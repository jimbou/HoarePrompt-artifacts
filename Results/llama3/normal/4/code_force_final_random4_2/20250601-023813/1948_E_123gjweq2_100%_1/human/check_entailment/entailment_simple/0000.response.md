Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a graph partitioning problem. The goal is to assign distinct integers to each vertex of a graph such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

The program uses a greedy approach to assign integers to the vertices. It first calculates the number of cliques required, which is the ceiling of `n/k`. Then, it creates an array `arr` to store the assigned integers and another array `cliquess` to store the clique number for each vertex.

The `make_array` function is used to assign integers to the vertices in each clique. It takes three arguments: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It assigns the integers from `left+1` to `right+1` to the vertices in the clique, in a way that the smallest and largest integers are assigned to the vertices at the ends of the clique, and the remaining integers are assigned in a decreasing order.

The program then prints the assigned integers, the number of cliques, and the clique numbers for each vertex.

The program is correct because it ensures that each vertex is assigned a distinct integer, and the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. The `make_array` function assigns the integers in a way that the vertices in each clique are connected to each other, and the number of cliques is minimized.

However, there is a small issue in the program. In the `make_array` function, the line `cliquess[left + i] = clique` should be `cliquess[left + mid - i - 1] = clique` to correctly assign the clique number to each vertex.

Correctness: **True**
