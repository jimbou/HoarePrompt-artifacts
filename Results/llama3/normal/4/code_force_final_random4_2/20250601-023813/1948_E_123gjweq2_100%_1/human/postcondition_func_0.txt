The function takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input, where `2 <= n <= 40` and `1 <= k <= 2n`. It then creates a list `arr` of `n` integers, where each integer from `i * k` to `min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1)` is set to `i + 1`, effectively dividing the list into segments of size `k` and assigning a unique integer to each segment. The function then prints the modified list `arr`, the number of segments `cliques`, and a list of `n` zeros `cliquess`.
