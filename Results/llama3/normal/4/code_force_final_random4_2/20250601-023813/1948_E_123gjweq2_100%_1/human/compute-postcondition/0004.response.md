Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, arr is a list of non-negative integers of length at least right + 1, cliquess is a list of non-negative integers of length at least right + 1, clique is a non-negative integer, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is greater than 0, not_mid is right - left + 1 - mid, i is 1, arr[left + mid - i - 1] is small_element + i, cliquess[left + i] is clique**

The code snippet provided does not modify any variables or their values. The first line assigns the value of `small_element + i` to `arr[left + mid - i - 1]`, but since `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is already equal to `small_element + i` according to the initial state, this line does not change the value of `arr[left + mid - i - 1]`. Similarly, the second line assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + i]`, but since `cliquess[left + i]` is already equal to `clique` according to the initial state, this line also does not change the value of `cliquess[left + i]`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
