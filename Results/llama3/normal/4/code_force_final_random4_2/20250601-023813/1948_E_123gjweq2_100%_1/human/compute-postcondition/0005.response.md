The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `mid`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `mid`. If `i` is less than `mid`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `mid` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `mid` must be greater than 2.
State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, arr is a list of non-negative integers of length at least right + 1, cliquess is a list of non-negative integers of length at least right + 1, clique is a non-negative integer, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is greater than 2, not_mid is right - left + 1 - mid, i is 2, arr[left + mid - i - 1] is small_element + i, cliquess[left + i] is clique**
