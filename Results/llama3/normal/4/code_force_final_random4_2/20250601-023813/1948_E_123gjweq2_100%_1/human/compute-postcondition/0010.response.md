The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `not_mid`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `not_mid`. If `i` is less than `not_mid`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `mid`, `not_mid` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `not_mid` must be at least 2.
State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, arr is a list of non-negative integers of length at least right + 1, cliquess is a list of non-negative integers of length at least right + 1, clique is a non-negative integer, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is greater than or equal to 0, not_mid is at least 2, i is mid + 1, arr[left + mid - i - 1] is small_element + i, cliquess[left + i] is clique, arr[left + mid + i] is big_element - i, cliquess[left + mid + i] is clique**
