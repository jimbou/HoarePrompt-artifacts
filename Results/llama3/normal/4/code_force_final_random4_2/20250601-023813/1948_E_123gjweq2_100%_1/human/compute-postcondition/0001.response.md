According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `mid`. If `mid` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, which may or may not be greater than 0. To ensure the loop can execute, `mid` must be greater than 0.

State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers of length at least `right` + 1, `cliquess` is a list of non-negative integers of length at least `right` + 1, `clique` is a non-negative integer, `small_element` is `left` + 1, `big_element` is `right` + 1, `mid` is greater than 0, `not_mid` is `right` - `left` + 1 - `mid`, and `i` is 0**
