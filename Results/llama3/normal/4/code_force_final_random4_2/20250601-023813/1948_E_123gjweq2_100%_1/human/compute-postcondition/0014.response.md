Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, arr is a list of non-negative integers of length at least right + 1, cliquess is a list of non-negative integers of length at least right + 1, clique is a non-negative integer, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is greater than or equal to 0, not_mid is greater than or equal to 0, i is mid + not_mid, arr[left + mid - i - 1] is small_element + i, cliquess[left + i] is clique, arr[left + mid + i] is big_element - i, cliquess[left + mid + i] is clique**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the loop has iterated over the entire range of 'not_mid' values. The loop variable 'i' has reached its final value, which is the sum of 'mid' and 'not_mid'. The array 'arr' and list 'cliquess' have been updated accordingly, with the elements at indices 'left + mid + i' and 'left + mid - i - 1' being set to 'big_element - i' and 'small_element + i', respectively. The other variables, such as 'left', 'right', 'clique', 'small_element', and 'big_element', remain unchanged.
