To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(not_mid):`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop counter. The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to `not_mid`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `mid + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

The state of `not_mid` is not changed, as it is not a variable in the loop head.

The other variables, such as `left`, `right`, `arr`, `cliquess`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, and `mid`, are not affected by the loop iteration and remain unchanged.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers of length at least `right` + 1, `cliquess` is a list of non-negative integers of length at least `right` + 1, `clique` is a non-negative integer, `small_element` is `left` + 1, `big_element` is `right` + 1, `mid` is greater than or equal to 0, `not_mid` is at least 2, `i` is `mid` + 2, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `small_element` + `i`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element` - `i`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`**
