Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer greater than 1, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, cur is 1, i is R[0] + 1, and if M1 is greater than 1, then ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time, and nums_left is N - R[0] - 1.
Code of the loop:
while i < N:
    if i == R[cur]:
        cur += 1
    else:
        ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
    nums_left -= 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: N is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer greater than 1, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If i equals R[cur], then cur is 2, i equals the value of R[2], and if M1 is greater than 1, then ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time, and nums_left is N - R[1] - 2. Otherwise, cur is 1, i is R[0] + 2, ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time multiplied by N - R[0] - 1 modulo MOD, and nums_left is N - R[0] - 2.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: N is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer greater than 1, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If i equals R[cur], then cur is either 2 or 3, i equals the value of R[2], and if M1 is greater than 1, then ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time, and nums_left is N - R[1] - 3. Otherwise, cur is either 1 or 2, i is R[0] + 3, ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time multiplied by N - R[0] - 1 modulo MOD, and nums_left is N - R[0] - 3. i is less than N.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: N is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer greater than 1, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If i equals R[cur], then cur is either 3 or 4, i equals the value of R[2], and if M1 is greater than 1, then ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time, and nums_left is N - R[1] - 4. Otherwise, cur is either 2 or 3, i is R[0] + 4, ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time multiplied by N - R[0] - 1 modulo MOD, and nums_left is N - R[0] - 4. If i does not equal R[cur], then cur is either 1, 2 or 3, ans is either the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time multiplied by N - R[0] - 1 modulo MOD or the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time, and nums_left is either N - R[0] - 4 or N - R[1] - 4. In all cases, i is less than N.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
