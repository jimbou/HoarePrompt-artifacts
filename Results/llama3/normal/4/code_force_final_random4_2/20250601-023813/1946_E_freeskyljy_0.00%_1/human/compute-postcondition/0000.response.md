Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code reads three lines from stdin for each test case. The first line assigns the values of three integers N, M1, and M2 to the corresponding variables. The second line assigns a list of M1 integers to the variable L, and the third line assigns a list of M2 integers to the variable R. After executing the code, the values of N, M1, and M2 are updated, and the lists L and R are populated with the corresponding integers. The stdin now contains one less test case.
