Postcondition: ***N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If M1 is greater than 1, then ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time, cur is 0, nums_left is 0, and i is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
