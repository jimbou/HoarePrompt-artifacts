To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the loop condition, which is `i > 1`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust its state.

According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is greater than 1. Right before the loop, `i` is `L[-1] - 1`. For the loop to execute the first time, `L[-1] - 1` must be greater than 1.

Since `L` is a list of `M1` integers between 1 and `N` in ascending order, we know that `L[-1]` is the largest integer in the list. To ensure `L[-1] - 1` is greater than 1, we need to adjust the state of `L[-1]` to be greater than 2.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order and L[-1] must be greater than 2, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time, cur is M1 - 2, nums_left is L[-1] - 2, and i is L[-1] - 1**
