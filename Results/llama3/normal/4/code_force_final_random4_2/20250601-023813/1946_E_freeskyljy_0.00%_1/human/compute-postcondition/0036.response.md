Postcondition: **N is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer greater than 1, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, cur is 1, and the current value of i equals the value of R[cur], and if M1 is greater than 1, then ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time, and nums_left is N - R[0] - 1**
