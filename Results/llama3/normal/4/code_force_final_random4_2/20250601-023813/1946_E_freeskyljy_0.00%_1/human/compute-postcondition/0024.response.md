Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order and L[-1] must be greater than 2 and L[cur - 1] must be greater than 1, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, nums_left is L[-1] - 4, and the current value of i is equal to the current value of L[cur - 1] minus one.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `nums_left` and `i`. The first line decrements `nums_left` by 1, making it `L[-1] - 4`. The second line decrements `i` by 1, making it equal to the current value of `L[cur - 1]` minus one. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
