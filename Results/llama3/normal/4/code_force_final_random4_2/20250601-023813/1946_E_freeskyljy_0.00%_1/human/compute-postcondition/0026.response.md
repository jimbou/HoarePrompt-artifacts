Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order and L[-1] must be greater than 2 and L[cur - 1] must be greater than 2, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, nums_left is L[-1] - 4, and the current value of i is equal to the current value of L[cur - 1] minus two.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of N, M1, M2, L, R, stdin, and nums_left remains the same as in the initial state. The only change is in the value of cur, which is decremented by 1, and as a result, the current value of i is also decremented by 1, now being equal to the current value of L[cur - 1] minus two.
