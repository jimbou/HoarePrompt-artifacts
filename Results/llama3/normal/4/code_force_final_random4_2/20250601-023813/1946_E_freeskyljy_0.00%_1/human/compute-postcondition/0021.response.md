Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order and L[-1] must be greater than 2 and L[cur - 1] must be greater than 1, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time, cur is M1 - 4, nums_left is L[-1] - 3, and the current value of i is equal to the current value of L[cur - 1].**

In natural language, the output state is: N, M1, M2, L, R, stdin, ans remain the same as before. The value of cur is decreased by 1, so it becomes M1 - 4. The value of nums_left remains the same, L[-1] - 3. The current value of i is now equal to the current value of L[cur - 1], which is L[M1 - 5].
