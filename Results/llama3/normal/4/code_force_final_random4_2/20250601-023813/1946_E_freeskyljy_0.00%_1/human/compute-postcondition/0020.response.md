The only variable in the loop head is variable i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i. If i is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is equal to L[cur - 1], so for the loop to be executed one more time, L[cur - 1] must be greater than 1.
State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order and L[-1] must be greater than 2 and L[cur - 1] must be greater than 1, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time, cur is M1 - 3, nums_left is L[-1] - 3, and the current value of i is equal to the current value of L[cur - 1].**
