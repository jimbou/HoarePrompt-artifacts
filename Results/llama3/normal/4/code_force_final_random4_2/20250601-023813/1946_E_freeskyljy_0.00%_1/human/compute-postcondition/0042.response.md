The variable in the loop head is variable i and N, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables i and N.  If i is less than N, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is R[2] or R[0] + 2, and N is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5. i being R[2] or R[0] + 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to i is less than N. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **N is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer greater than 1, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If i equals R[cur], then cur is 2, i equals the value of R[2], and if M1 is greater than 1, then ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time, and nums_left is N - R[1] - 2. Otherwise, cur is 1, i is R[0] + 2, ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time multiplied by N - R[0] - 1 modulo MOD, and nums_left is N - R[0] - 2. i is less than N**
