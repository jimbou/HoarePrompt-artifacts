Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer greater than 1, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, cur is 1, i is R[0] + 1, and if M1 is greater than 1, then ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time, and nums_left is N - R[0] - 1.**

In this final state, the values of N, M1, M2, L, and R remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The value of cur is updated to 1, and the value of i is updated to R[0] + 1. If M1 is greater than 1, the value of ans remains the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time, and the value of nums_left remains N - R[0] - 1. The state of stdin is also unchanged, containing multiple test cases minus one.
