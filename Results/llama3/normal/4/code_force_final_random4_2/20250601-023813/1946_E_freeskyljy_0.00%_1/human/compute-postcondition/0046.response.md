Output State: **N is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer greater than 1, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If i equals R[cur], then cur is either 2 or 3, i equals the value of R[2], and if M1 is greater than 1, then ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time, and nums_left is N - R[1] - 3. Otherwise, cur is either 1 or 2, i is R[0] + 3, ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time multiplied by N - R[0] - 1 modulo MOD, and nums_left is N - R[0] - 3. i is less than N.**

In this output state, the value of `nums_left` has been decremented by 1, and the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The conditions and relationships between the variables are still valid, with the adjustments made to `nums_left` and `i` as specified in the code.
