Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, `M1` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `M2` is an integer greater than 1, `L` is a list of `M1` integers between 1 and `N` in ascending order, `R` is a list of `M2` integers between 1 and `N` in ascending order, `i` is less than `N`, `cur` is either 1, 2 or 3, `ans` is either the number of combinations of `N - 1` items taken 1 at a time multiplied by `N - R[0] - 1` modulo `MOD` or the number of combinations of `N - 1` items taken 1 at a time, `nums_left` is either `N - R[0] - 3` or `N - R[1] - 3`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated by multiplying it with `nums_left` and taking the modulus `MOD`. The values of `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, `i`, `cur`, and `nums_left` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `ans` is now either the number of combinations of `N - 1` items taken 1 at a time multiplied by `N - R[0] - 1` modulo `MOD` or the number of combinations of `N - 1` items taken 1 at a time, depending on the value of `M1`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
