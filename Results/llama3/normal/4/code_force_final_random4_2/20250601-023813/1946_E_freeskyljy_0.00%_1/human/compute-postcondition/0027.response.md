Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `M1` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, `M2` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `L` is a list of `M1` integers between 1 and `N` in ascending order and `L[-1]` must be greater than 2 and `L[cur - 1]` must be greater than 2, `R` is a list of `M2` integers between 1 and `N` in ascending order, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`, `i` is equal to `L[cur - 1] - 1`, and `ans` is equal to `ans * (L[-1] - 4) % MOD`.**

In this output state, the values of `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, `stdin`, `nums_left`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is in the value of `ans`, which is now equal to the result of multiplying the previous value of `ans` by `nums_left` (which is `L[-1] - 4`) and taking the modulus `MOD`.
