Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, `M1` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `M2` is an integer greater than 1, `L` is a list of `M1` integers between 1 and `N` in ascending order, `R` is a list of `M2` integers between 1 and `N` in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `cur` is 1, `i` is `R[0] + 1`, `ans` is the number of combinations of `N - 1` items taken 1 at a time multiplied by `N - R[0] - 1` modulo `MOD`, and `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, `cur`, `i`, and `nums_left` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `ans` is updated to be the result of multiplying the number of combinations of `N - 1` items taken 1 at a time by `N - R[0] - 1` modulo `MOD`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
