Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time, cur is 0, nums_left is 0, and i is 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the values of the variables in the loop head and body. The loop continues to execute until i is less than or equal to 1. At this point, cur is 0, nums_left is 0, and i is 1. The value of ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time, which is equal to N - 1.
