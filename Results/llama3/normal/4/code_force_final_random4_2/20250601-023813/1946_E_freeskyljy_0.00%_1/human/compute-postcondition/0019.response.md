Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order and L[-1] must be greater than 2, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time, if i is equal to L[cur], then cur is M1 - 3, nums_left is L[-1] - 3, and the current value of i is equal to the current value of L[cur - 1]. Otherwise, ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time multiplied by L[-1] - 2 modulo MOD, cur is M1 - 2, nums_left is L[-1] - 3, and i is not equal to L[cur].**

The code snippet modifies the values of `nums_left` and `i`. The first line decrements `nums_left` by 1, making it `L[-1] - 3`. The second line decrements `i` by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
