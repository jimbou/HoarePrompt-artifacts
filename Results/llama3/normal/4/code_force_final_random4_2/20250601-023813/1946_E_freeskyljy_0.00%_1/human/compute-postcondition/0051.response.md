Output State: **N is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer greater than 1, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If i equals R[cur], then cur is either 3 or 4, i equals the value of R[2], and if M1 is greater than 1, then ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time, and nums_left is N - R[1] - 4. Otherwise, cur is either 2 or 3, i is R[0] + 4, ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time multiplied by N - R[0] - 1 modulo MOD, and nums_left is N - R[0] - 4. If i does not equal R[cur], then cur is either 1, 2 or 3, ans is either the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time multiplied by N - R[0] - 1 modulo MOD or the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time, and nums_left is either N - R[0] - 4 or N - R[1] - 4. In all cases, i is less than N.**

In this final state, the value of `nums_left` has been decremented by 1, and the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and relationships between variables are still valid, but the specific values of `nums_left` and `i` have been updated according to the code.
