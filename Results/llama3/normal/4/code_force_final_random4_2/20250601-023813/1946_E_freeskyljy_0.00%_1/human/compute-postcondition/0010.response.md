Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time, cur is M1 - 2.**

The code snippet calculates the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time and assigns it to the variable ans. It also assigns the value of M1 - 2 to the variable cur. The values of N, M1, M2, L, and R remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
