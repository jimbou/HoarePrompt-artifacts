Postcondition: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order and L[-1] must be greater than 2 and L[cur - 1] must be greater than 2, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, nums_left is L[-1] - 4. If i is equal to L[cur], then the current value of i is equal to the current value of L[cur - 1] minus two. Otherwise, i is equal to L[cur - 1] - 1 and ans is equal to ans * (L[-1] - 4) % MOD.**
