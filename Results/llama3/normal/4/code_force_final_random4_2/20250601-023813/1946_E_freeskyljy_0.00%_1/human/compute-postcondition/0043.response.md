Output State: **N is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer greater than 1, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If i equals R[cur], then cur is 3, i equals the value of R[2], and if M1 is greater than 1, then ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time, and nums_left is N - R[1] - 2. Otherwise, cur is 2, i is R[0] + 2, ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time multiplied by N - R[0] - 1 modulo MOD, and nums_left is N - R[0] - 2. i is less than N**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been incremented by 1. If `i` equals `R[cur]`, then `cur` is now 3, and `i` is still equal to the value of `R[2]`. If `M1` is greater than 1, then `ans` and `nums_left` remain the same. Otherwise, `cur` is now 2, and `i` is still equal to `R[0] + 2`, with `ans` and `nums_left` remaining the same. The values of `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, and `R` are unchanged, and `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus one.
