Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `M1` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, `M2` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `L` is a list of `M1` integers between 1 and `N` in ascending order and `L[-1]` must be greater than 2 and `L[cur - 1]` must be greater than 1, `R` is a list of `M2` integers between 1 and `N` in ascending order, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `ans` is the number of combinations of `N - 1` items taken `L[-1] - 1` at a time multiplied by `L[-1] - 3` modulo `MOD`, `cur` is `M1 - 3`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 3`, and the current value of `i` is equal to the current value of `L[cur - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the result of multiplying the previous value of `ans` by `L[-1] - 3` and then taking the modulus `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged.
