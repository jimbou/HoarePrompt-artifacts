Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time, cur is M1 - 2, nums_left is L[-1] - 2, and i is L[-1] - 1.
Code of the loop:
while i > 1:
    if i == L[cur]:
        cur -= 1
    else:
        ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
    nums_left -= 1
    i -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order and L[-1] must be greater than 2, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time, if i is equal to L[cur], then cur is M1 - 3, nums_left is L[-1] - 3, and the current value of i is equal to the current value of L[cur - 1]. Otherwise, ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time multiplied by L[-1] - 2 modulo MOD, cur is M1 - 2, nums_left is L[-1] - 3, and i is not equal to L[cur].
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order and L[-1] must be greater than 2 and L[cur - 1] must be greater than 1, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, nums_left is L[-1] - 4, and the current value of i is equal to the current value of L[cur - 1] minus one.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order and L[-1] must be greater than 2 and L[cur - 1] must be greater than 2, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, nums_left is L[-1] - 5, i is equal to L[cur - 1] - 1 if i is not equal to L[cur], otherwise i is equal to L[cur - 1] minus two, ans is equal to ans * (L[-1] - 4) % MOD.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
