Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, `M1` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `M2` is an integer greater than 1, `L` is a list of `M1` integers between 1 and `N` in ascending order, `R` is a list of `M2` integers between 1 and `N` in ascending order, `i` is less than `N`, if `i` equals `R[cur]`, then `cur` is 2, `i` equals the value of `R[2]`, and if `M1` is greater than 1, then `ans` is the number of combinations of `N - 1` items taken 1 at a time multiplied by `N - R[1] - 2` modulo `MOD`, and `nums_left` is `N - R[1] - 2`. Otherwise, `cur` is 1, `i` is `R[0] + 2`, `ans` is the number of combinations of `N - 1` items taken 1 at a time multiplied by `N - R[0] - 1` multiplied by `N - R[0] - 2` modulo `MOD`, and `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 2`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by multiplying it with `nums_left` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `i`, `cur`, `M1`, and `M2` are still valid, and the lists `L` and `R` remain the same. The value of `N` is still between 3 and 2 * 10^5, and `i` is still less than `N`.
