Output State: **The program returns the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time, multiplied by the product of all integers from N - R[0] to N - R[M2 - 1] modulo MOD, if M2 is greater than 1 and M1 is greater than 1. If M2 is greater than 1 and M1 is not greater than 1, the program returns the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time. If M2 is not greater than 1, the program returns the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time, if M1 is greater than 1. Otherwise, the program returns the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time.**
