Postcondition: ***N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order. If M2 is greater than 1, then i is N, cur is M2, and if M1 is greater than 1, then ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time multiplied by the product of all integers from N - R[0] to N - R[M2 - 1] modulo MOD, and nums_left is 0. Otherwise, cur is M2, ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time, and nums_left is 0. If M2 is not greater than 1, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If M1 is greater than 1, then ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken 1 at a time, cur is 0, i is 1, and nums_left is N - R[0] - 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
