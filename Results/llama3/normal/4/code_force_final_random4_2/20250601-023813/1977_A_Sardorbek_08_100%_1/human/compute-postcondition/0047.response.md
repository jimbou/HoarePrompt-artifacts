Functionality: **This function reads a series of input lines from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) and each subsequent line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). It then iterates over these input lines, comparing the values of n and m. If n is equal to m, it prints 'YES'. If n is less than m, it prints 'NO'. If n is greater than m, it checks if n and m have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd) and prints 'Yes' if they do, or 'No' if they don't. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the results directly to the console.**
