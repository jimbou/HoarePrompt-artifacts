Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either puts exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases 'a' from the input.
2. It then iterates over each test case using a for loop.
3. For each test case, it reads two integers 'b' and 'c' from the input, where 'b' represents the number of moves and 'c' represents the desired number of cubes in the tower.
4. The program then checks the following conditions:
   - If 'b' is equal to 'c', it prints 'YES' because it is possible to build a tower with exactly 'c' cubes after 'b' moves by simply adding one cube at a time.
   - If 'b' is less than 'c', it prints 'NO' because it is not possible to build a tower with more cubes than the number of moves.
   - If 'b' is greater than 'c' and 'b' and 'c' have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), it prints 'Yes' because it is possible to build a tower with exactly 'c' cubes after 'b' moves by adding or removing cubes appropriately.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'No'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and provides the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
