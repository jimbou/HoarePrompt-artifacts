Postcondition: **a is at least 2, i is 1, b and c are integers between 1 and 100, q is a tuple containing two integers between 1 and 100, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100), with two less lines than initially. If b is less than c, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if b and c have the same parity, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**
