Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program correctly determines whether it is possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The key insight is that the number of cubes in the tower can only change by 1 in each move, so the parity of the number of cubes (even or odd) must remain the same.

The program correctly handles the following cases:

* If b == c, it prints "YES" because it is possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes by adding or removing cubes one by one.
* If b < c, it prints "NO" because it is not possible to build a tower with more cubes than the number of moves.
* If b % 2 == c % 2, it prints "Yes" because the parity of the number of cubes is the same, and it is possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes by adding or removing cubes one by one.
* If b % 2 != c % 2, it prints "No" because the parity of the number of cubes is different, and it is not possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, and the logic is sound. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
