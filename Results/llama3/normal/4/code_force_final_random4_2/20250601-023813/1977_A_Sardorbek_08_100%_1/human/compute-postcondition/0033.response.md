The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `a` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `a` must be greater than the new value of `i`. So `i` is 2 and `a` must be greater than 2.
State: **`a` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `b` and `c` are integers between 1 and 100, `q` is a tuple containing two integers between 1 and 100, `stdin` contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 100), with two less lines than initially. If `b` is equal to `c`, 'YES' is printed. If `b` is less than `c`, 'NO' is printed. If `b` is greater than `c`, 'Yes' is printed if `b` and `c` have the same parity, otherwise 'No' is printed.**
