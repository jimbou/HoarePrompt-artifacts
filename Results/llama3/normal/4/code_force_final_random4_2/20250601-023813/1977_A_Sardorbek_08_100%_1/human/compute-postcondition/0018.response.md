Postcondition: ***a is at least 1, i is 0, b is an integer between 1 and 100, c is an integer between 1 and 100, q is a tuple containing two integers between 1 and 100, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100), with one less line than initially. Additionally, b is not equal to c. If b is less than c, 'NO' is printed. If b is not less than c, then if b and c have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), 'Yes' is printed. If b and c have different parity (i.e., one is even and the other is odd), 'No' is printed.***
