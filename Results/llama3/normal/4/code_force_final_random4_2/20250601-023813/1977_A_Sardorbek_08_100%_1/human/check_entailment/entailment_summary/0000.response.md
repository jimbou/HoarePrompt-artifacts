Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to build a tower with m cubes after n moves. The program checks three conditions:

1. If n is equal to m, it prints 'YES' because Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower n times in a row.
2. If n is less than m, it prints 'NO' because Nikita cannot build a tower with more cubes than the number of moves.
3. If n is greater than m, it checks if n and m have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd). If they do, it prints 'Yes' because Nikita can build a tower with m cubes by putting 1 cube on top of the tower n times and then removing some cubes. If they don't, it prints 'No' because Nikita cannot build a tower with m cubes.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
