Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the first line of input.
2. It then iterates over each test case, reading two integers `n` and `m` from each line.
3. The program checks three conditions:
   - If `n` is equal to `m`, it prints 'YES', which is correct because Nikita can put `n` cubes on top of the tower in `n` moves.
   - If `n` is less than `m`, it prints 'NO', which is correct because Nikita cannot put more cubes on top of the tower than the number of moves he has.
   - If `n` is greater than `m`, it checks if `n` and `m` have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd). If they do, it prints 'Yes', which is correct because Nikita can put `m` cubes on top of the tower in `n` moves by adding or removing cubes in pairs. If they don't, it prints 'No', which is correct because Nikita cannot put `m` cubes on top of the tower in `n` moves if `n` and `m` have different parities.

Overall, the program correctly determines whether it is possible for Nikita to build a tower with `m` cubes in `n` moves, based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
