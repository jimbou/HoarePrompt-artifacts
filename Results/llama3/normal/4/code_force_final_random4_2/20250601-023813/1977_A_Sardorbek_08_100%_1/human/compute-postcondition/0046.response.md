Output State: **a is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), i is a-1, b and c are integers between 1 and 100, q is a tuple containing two integers between 1 and 100, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100), with a less lines than initially. If b is equal to c, 'YES' is printed. If b is less than c, 'NO' is printed. If b is greater than c, 'Yes' is printed if b and c have the same parity, otherwise 'No' is printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `a` remains unchanged, `i` will be one less than `a` (since the loop iterates `a` times), `b` and `c` will still be integers between 1 and 100, and `q` will be a tuple containing two integers between 1 and 100. The number of lines in `stdin` will be reduced by `a` lines. The print statements will still follow the same logic as before, printing 'YES' if `b` is equal to `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, and 'Yes' or 'No' depending on the parity of `b` and `c` if `b` is greater than `c`.
