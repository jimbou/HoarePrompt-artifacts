Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower.

The program correctly handles the following cases:

1.  If the number of moves (n) is equal to the number of cubes (m), it prints "YES" because it is possible to build a tower with m cubes by adding 1 cube in each move.
2.  If the number of moves (n) is less than the number of cubes (m), it prints "NO" because it is not possible to build a tower with m cubes in less than m moves.
3.  If the number of moves (n) is greater than the number of cubes (m), it checks whether n and m have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd). If they have the same parity, it prints "Yes" because it is possible to build a tower with m cubes by adding or removing cubes in pairs. If they have different parity, it prints "No" because it is not possible to build a tower with m cubes in this case.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and provides the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
