Postcondition: ***a is at least 1, i is 0, b is an integer between 1 and 100, c is an integer between 1 and 100, q is a tuple containing two integers between 1 and 100, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100), with one less line than initially. Additionally, b is not equal to c, b is not less than c, and b and c have different parity (i.e., one is even and the other is odd).***
