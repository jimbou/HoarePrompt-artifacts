The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `a` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than 1.
State: **a is at least 2, i is 1, b and c are integers between 1 and 100, q is a tuple containing two integers between 1 and 100, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100), with one less line than initially. If b is equal to c, 'YES' is printed. If b is not equal to c, then if b is less than c, 'NO' is printed. If b is not less than c, then if b and c have the same parity, 'Yes' is printed. If b and c have different parity, 'No' is printed.**
