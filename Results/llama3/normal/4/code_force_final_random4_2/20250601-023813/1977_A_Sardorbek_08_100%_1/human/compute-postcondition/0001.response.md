The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) does ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `a` is at least 1 and `i` is now 0. 
State: **`a` is at least 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100)**
