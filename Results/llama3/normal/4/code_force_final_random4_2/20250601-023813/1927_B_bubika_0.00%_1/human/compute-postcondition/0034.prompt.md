Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n).
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    r = ''
    for i in s:
        x = b.index(i)
        r += a[x]
        b[x] += 1
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the value at index x is equal to the number of times x appears in s and all other values are 0, t is 0, n is an integer, s is an empty list, r is a string containing the characters at the indices in s in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' in the order they appear in s, i is the last element in the list s, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, and the string r is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the value at index x is equal to the number of times x appears in s and the value at index i is incremented by the number of times i appears in s, t is 1, n is an integer, s is a list of integers, r is a string containing the characters at index i in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' for each i in s, i is the last element in the list s, stdin contains 0 inputs, and the string r is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the value at index x is equal to the number of times x appears in s and the value at index i is incremented by the number of times i appears in s plus the length of s, t is 2, n is an integer, s is a list of integers, r is a string containing the characters at index i in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' for each i in s, i is the last element in s, and stdin contains 0 inputs, and the string r which contains the characters at index i in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' for each i in s is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
