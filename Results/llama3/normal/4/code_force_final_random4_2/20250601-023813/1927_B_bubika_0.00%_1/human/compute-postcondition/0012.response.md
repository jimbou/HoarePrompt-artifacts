To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for t in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t` and the number of test cases remaining in the input. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 0, and there is at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs remaining in `stdin`.

For the loop to execute again, `t` needs to be incremented by 1, and there must be at least 1 more test case remaining in `stdin`.

State: **`a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 integers where the value at index x is equal to the number of times x appears in s and all other values are 0, `t` is 1, `n` is an integer, `s` is an empty list, `r` is a string containing the characters at the indices in s in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' in the order they appear in s, `i` is the last element in the list s, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 1 inputs, and the string r is being printed**
