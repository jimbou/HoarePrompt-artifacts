Output State: **a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n).**

The code initializes a string `a` with the lowercase English alphabet and a list `b` with 26 zeros. The stdin remains unchanged as the code does not interact with it.
