Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. It then generates a string r by mapping each integer in the list to a character in the alphabet (where the mapping is determined by the frequency of each integer), and prints the resulting string. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding strings.**
