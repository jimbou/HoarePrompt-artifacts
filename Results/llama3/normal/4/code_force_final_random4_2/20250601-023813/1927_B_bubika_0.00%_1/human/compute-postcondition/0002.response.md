Output State: **a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 zeros, t is 0, n is an integer, s is a list of integers, r is an empty string, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**

Explanation: The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `s`. The third line initializes an empty string `r`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged. Stdin now contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.
