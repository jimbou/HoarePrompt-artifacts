Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the value at index x is equal to the number of times x appears in s and the value at index i is incremented by the number of times i appears in s, t is 2, n is an integer, s is a list of integers, r is an empty string, i is not defined, and stdin contains 0 inputs.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    x = b.index(i)
    r += a[x]
    b[x] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the value at index x is equal to the number of times x appears in s and the value at index i is incremented by the number of times i appears in s plus one, t is 2, n is an integer, s is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, r is a string containing the character at index i in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', i is the first element in s, and stdin contains 0 inputs.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the value at index x is equal to the number of times x appears in s and the value at index i is incremented by the number of times i appears in s plus two, t is 2, n is an integer, s is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, r is a string containing the character at index i in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' plus the character at index x in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', i is the second element in s, and stdin contains 0 inputs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the value at index x is equal to the number of times x appears in s and the value at index i is incremented by the number of times i appears in s plus three, t is 2, n is an integer, s is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, r is a string containing the character at index i in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' plus the character at index x in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' plus the character at index x in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', i is the third element in s, and stdin contains 0 inputs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
