Output State: **a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the value at index x is equal to the number of times x appears in s and all other values are 0, t is 0, n is an integer, s is an empty list, r is a string containing the characters at the indices in s in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' in the order they appear in s, i is the last element in the list s, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the string `a` remains unchanged, the list `b` will have the count of each index in `s` at the corresponding index, the integer `t` and `n` remain unchanged, the list `s` will be empty, the string `r` will contain all the characters at the indices in `s` in the order they appear, and `i` will be the last element in the list `s`. The stdin will still contain at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.
