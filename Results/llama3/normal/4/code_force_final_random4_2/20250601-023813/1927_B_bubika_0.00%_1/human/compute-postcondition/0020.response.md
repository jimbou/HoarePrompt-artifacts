Output State: **a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the value at index x is equal to the number of times x appears in s and the value at index i is incremented by the number of times i appears in s, t is 1, n is an integer, s is a list of integers, r is a string containing the characters at index i in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' for each i in s, i is the last element in the list s, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is:

* The string 'a' remains unchanged.
* The list 'b' is updated such that the value at each index 'x' is equal to the number of times 'x' appears in the list 's', and the value at index 'i' is incremented by the number of times 'i' appears in 's'.
* The variable 't' remains unchanged at 1.
* The variable 'n' remains unchanged.
* The list 's' remains unchanged.
* The string 'r' contains the characters at index 'i' in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' for each 'i' in the list 's'.
* The variable 'i' is the last element in the list 's'.
* The stdin contains 0 inputs.
