The code prints the values of `y` and `x` in that order.
Since `x` and `y` are integers, but their exact values are not specified, we can't provide a numerical value for the output.
However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the values of `y` and `x`.
Output: **y (where y is an integer), x (where x is an integer)**
