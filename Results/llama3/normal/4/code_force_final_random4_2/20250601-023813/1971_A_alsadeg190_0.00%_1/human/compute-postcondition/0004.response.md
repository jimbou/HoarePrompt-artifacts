The code prints the values of `x` and `y`, which are integers. Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we can't determine their exact numerical values. However, based on the precondition, we know that the current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`.

Output: **x (which is an integer greater than y), y (which is an integer less than x)**
