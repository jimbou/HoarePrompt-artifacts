Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers, `i` is 2, stdin contains no input.**

The code `x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` assigns the values of `x` and `y` to the integers from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. However, since the stdin contains no input, the values of `x` and `y` are not updated. The value of `i` remains unchanged as 2.
