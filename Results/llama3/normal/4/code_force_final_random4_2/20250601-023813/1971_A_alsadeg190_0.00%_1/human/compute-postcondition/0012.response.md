Based on the initial state, `x` and `y` are integers, but their explicit values are not provided. The variable `i` is equal to 1, but it is not used in the print statement. Since `stdin` contains no input, there is no external data that could affect the values of `x` and `y`.

The print statement simply prints the values of `x` and `y`. Since their explicit values are not provided, we can only describe their values as the current values of the variables `x` and `y`.

Output: **the current values of x and y**
