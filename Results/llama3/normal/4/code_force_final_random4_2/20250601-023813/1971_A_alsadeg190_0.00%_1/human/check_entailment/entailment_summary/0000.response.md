Reasoning:

The program is designed to read a series of pairs of integers, compare each pair, and print them in order, with the larger number first. However, the problem statement requires the program to print the minimum of x and y followed by the maximum of x and y.

The program's logic is incorrect because it prints the larger number first, followed by the smaller number. This is the opposite of what the problem statement requires.

Correctness: **False**
