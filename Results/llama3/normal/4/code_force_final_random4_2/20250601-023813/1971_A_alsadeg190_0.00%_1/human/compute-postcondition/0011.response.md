Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers, `i` is 1, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `x` and `y` are updated to the integers input from stdin, which is now empty. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. The condition that `x` and `y` are integers is still valid, and the stdin is now empty since it has been used to input the values of `x` and `y`.
