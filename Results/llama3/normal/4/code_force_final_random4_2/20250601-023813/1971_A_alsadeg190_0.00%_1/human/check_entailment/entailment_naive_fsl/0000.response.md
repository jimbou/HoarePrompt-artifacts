Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly output the minimum and maximum of x and y. In the case where x is greater than y, the program prints x and y in the wrong order. It should print the minimum (y) first, followed by the maximum (x).

For example, if the input is "8 4", the program will output "8 4", but the correct output should be "4 8".
