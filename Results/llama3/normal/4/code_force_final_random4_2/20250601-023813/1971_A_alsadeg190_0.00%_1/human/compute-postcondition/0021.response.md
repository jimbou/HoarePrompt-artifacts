The code prints the values of `y` and `x` in that order.
Since `x` and `y` are integers, but their exact values are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values that will be printed.
However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the values of `y` and `x` as they are defined in the initial state.
Output: **y (where y is the value of y), x (where x is the value of x)**
