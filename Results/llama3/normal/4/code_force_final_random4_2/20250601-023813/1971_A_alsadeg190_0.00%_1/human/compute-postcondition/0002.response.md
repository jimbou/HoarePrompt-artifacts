Output State: **`x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `i` is 0, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `x` is no longer guaranteed to be greater than 0, as it is reassigned to an integer from the input. The value of `y` is also an integer from the input. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The stdin is now empty, as it has been used to read the input for `x` and `y`.
