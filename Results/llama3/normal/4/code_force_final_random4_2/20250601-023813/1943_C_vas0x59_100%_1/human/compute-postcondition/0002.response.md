Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, u2vs is a list of n lists where the list at index u and the list at index v each contain the integer that is the other index, u is an integer equal to the first input integer minus 1, v is an integer equal to the second input integer minus 1, _ is 0, stdin contains -2 inputs**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `u2vs` is modified by appending `v` to the list at index `u` and appending `u` to the list at index `v`. The variables `u` and `v` are assigned the values of the input integers minus 1. The variable `_` remains unchanged with a value of 0. Stdin now contains -2 inputs as two integers have been read from it.
