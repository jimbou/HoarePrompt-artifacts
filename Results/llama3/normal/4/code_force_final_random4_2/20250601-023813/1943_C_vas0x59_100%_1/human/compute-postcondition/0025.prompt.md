Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, u2vs is a list of n lists where the list at index u and the list at index v each contain the integer that is the other index, and the lists at indices u and v each contain n-2 additional integers that are the other index, u is an integer equal to the first input integer minus n+1, v is an integer equal to the second input integer minus n+1, _ is n-1, stdin contains -2(n-1) - 2 inputs, d is the result of bfs(0), a is the result of func_1(d), previous is the result of bfs(a), b is the result of func_1(d), path_ba is a list containing b
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u and the list at index v each contain the integer that is the other index, and the lists at indices u and v each contain n-2 additional integers that are the other index, `u` is an integer equal to the first input integer minus n+1, `v` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus n+1, `_` is n-1, `d` is the result of bfs(0), `a` is the result of func_1(d), `previous` is the result of bfs(a), `b` is the result of func_1(d), `path_ba` is a list containing b and n, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or n is not -1, stdin contains -2(n-1) - 2 inputs.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u and the list at index v each contain the integer that is the other index, and the lists at indices u and v each contain n-2 additional integers that are the other index, `u` is an integer equal to the first input integer minus n+1, `v` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus n+1, `_` is n-1, `d` is the result of bfs(0), `a` is the result of func_1(d), `previous` is the result of bfs(a), `b` is the result of func_1(d), `path_ba` is a list containing b, n, and the value of `previous` at index `path_ba[-1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or n is not -1, stdin contains -2(n-1) - 2 inputs
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u and the list at index v each contain the integer that is the other index, and the lists at indices u and v each contain n-2 additional integers that are the other index, `u` is an integer equal to the first input integer minus n+1, `v` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus n+1, `_` is n-1, `d` is the result of bfs(0), `a` is the result of func_1(d), `previous` is the result of bfs(a), `b` is the result of func_1(d), `path_ba` is a list containing b, n, the value of `previous` at index `path_ba[-1]`, and the value of `previous` at index `path_ba[-1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or n is not -1, stdin contains -2(n-1) - 2 inputs, and `n` is the value of `previous` at index `path_ba[-1]`. If n is -1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
