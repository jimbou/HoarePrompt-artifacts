Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u and the list at index v each contain the integer that is the other index, and the lists at indices u and v each contain n-2 additional integers that are the other index, `u` is an integer equal to the first input integer minus n+1, `v` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus n+1, `_` is n-1, `d` is the result of bfs(0), `a` is the result of func_1(d), `previous` is the result of bfs(a), `b` is the result of func_1(d), `path_ba` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `ops` is a list containing the tuple (c, i) repeated ci+1 times where c is the value of `path_ba` at index `ci`, `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, `c` is the value of `path_ba` at index `ci`, and `stdin` contains -2(n-1) - 2 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the list `ops` will contain `ci+1` tuples, each containing the value `c` (which is the value of `path_ba` at index `ci`) and the index `i`, where `i` ranges from 0 to `ci`. The other variables remain unchanged.
