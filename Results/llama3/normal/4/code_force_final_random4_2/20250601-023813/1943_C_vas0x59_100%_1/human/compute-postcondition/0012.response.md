Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u and the list at index v each contain the integer that is the other index, and the lists at indices u and v each contain n-2 additional integers that are the other index, `u` is an integer equal to the first input integer minus n+1, `v` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus n+1, `_` is n-1, `d` is the result of bfs(0), `a` is the result of func_1(d), `previous` is the result of bfs(a), `b` is the result of func_1(d), `path_ba` is a list containing b, and the current value of `n` is -1, which is also the value of `previous` at index `path_ba[-1]`, stdin contains -2(n-1) - 2 inputs, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `u2vs`, `u`, `v`, `_`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`, and `n` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains -2(n-1) - 2 inputs.
