The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u and the list at index v each contain the integer that is the other index, `u` is an integer equal to the first input integer minus 1, `v` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus 1, `_` is 1, stdin contains -2 inputs**
