Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, u2vs is a list of n lists where the list at index u and the list at index v each contain the integer that is the other index, and the lists at indices u and v each contain an additional integer that is the other index, u is an integer equal to the first input integer minus 2, v is an integer equal to the second input integer minus 2, _ is 1, stdin contains no inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `u2vs` is modified by appending the value of `v` to the list at index `u` and the value of `u` to the list at index `v`. The values of `u` and `v` are decremented by 1, and the stdin is empty as all inputs have been consumed. The value of `_` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
