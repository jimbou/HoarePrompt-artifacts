The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `ci`. If `i` is less than `ci + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `ci` is at least 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `ci` must be at least 1.
State: **`u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u and the list at index v each contain the integer that is the other index, and the lists at indices u and v each contain n-2 additional integers that are the other index, `u` is an integer equal to the first input integer minus n+1, `v` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus n+1, `_` is n-1, `d` is the result of bfs(0), `a` is the result of func_1(d), `previous` is the result of bfs(a), `b` is the result of func_1(d), `path_ba` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `ops` is a list containing the tuple (c, i) and the tuple (c, i) where c is the value of `path_ba` at index `ci` and i is 2, `ci` is at least 1, `c` is the value of `path_ba` at index `ci`, `i` is 2, and `stdin` contains -2(n-1) - 2 inputs**
