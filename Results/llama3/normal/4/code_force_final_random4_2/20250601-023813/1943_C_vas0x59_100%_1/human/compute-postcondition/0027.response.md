Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u and the list at index v each contain the integer that is the other index, and the lists at indices u and v each contain n-2 additional integers that are the other index, `u` is an integer equal to the first input integer minus n+1, `v` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus n+1, `_` is n-1, `d` is the result of bfs(0), `a` is the result of func_1(d), `previous` is the result of bfs(a), `b` is the result of func_1(d), `path_ba` is a list containing b and all the values of `previous` at index `path_ba[-1]` until `n` is -1, `ops` is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or n is -1, stdin contains -2(n-1) - 2 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is that all the variables remain unchanged except for the addition of a new variable `ops` which is an empty list. The other variables retain their previous values, and the loop remains in the same state, ready to break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or when `n` becomes -1.
