Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u and the list at index v each contain the integer that is the other index, and the lists at indices u and v each contain n-2 additional integers that are the other index, `u` is an integer equal to the first input integer minus n+1, `v` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus n+1, `_` is n-1, `d` is the result of bfs(0), `a` is the result of func_1(d), `previous` is the result of bfs(a), `b` is the result of func_1(d), `path_ba` is a list containing b and all the values of `previous` at index `path_ba[-1]` until `n` is -1, `ops` is an empty list, `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `ci1` is `ci2` minus 1, `c1` is the value at index `ci1` in `path_ba`, `c2` is the value at index `ci2` in `path_ba`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or n is -1, stdin contains -2(n-1) - 2 inputs.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - ci1, 2):
    ops.append((c1, i))
    ops.append((c2, i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: u2vs is a list of n lists where the list at index u and the list at index v each contain the integer that is the other index, and the lists at indices u and v each contain n-2 additional integers that are the other index, u is an integer equal to the first input integer minus n+1, v is an integer equal to the second input integer minus n+1, _ is n-1, d is the result of bfs(0), a is the result of func_1(d), previous is the result of bfs(a), b is the result of func_1(d), path_ba is a list containing b and all the values of previous at index path_ba[-1] until n is -1 and has at least ci1 + 1 elements, ops is a list containing (c1, i) and (c2, i), ci2 is half the length of path_ba, ci1 is ci2 minus 1 and makes len(path_ba) - ci1 an odd number, c1 is the value at index ci1 in path_ba, c2 is the value at index ci2 in path_ba, i is at least 1, and stdin contains -2(n-1) - 2 inputs.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: u2vs is a list of n lists where the list at index u and the list at index v each contain the integer that is the other index, and the lists at indices u and v each contain n-2 additional integers that are the other index, u is an integer equal to the first input integer minus n+1, v is an integer equal to the second input integer minus n+1, _ is n-1, d is the result of bfs(0), a is the result of func_1(d), previous is the result of bfs(a), b is the result of func_1(d), path_ba is a list containing b and all the values of previous at index path_ba[-1] until n is -1 and has at least ci1 + 3 elements, ops is a list containing (c1, i), (c2, i), (c1, i), and (c2, i), ci2 is half the length of path_ba, ci1 is ci2 minus 1 and makes len(path_ba) - ci1 an odd number, c1 is the value at index ci1 in path_ba, c2 is the value at index ci2 in path_ba, i is at least 3, and stdin contains -2(n-1) - 2 inputs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: u2vs is a list of n lists where the list at index u and the list at index v each contain the integer that is the other index, and the lists at indices u and v each contain n-2 additional integers that are the other index, u is an integer equal to the first input integer minus n+1, v is an integer equal to the second input integer minus n+1, _ is n-1, d is the result of bfs(0), a is the result of func_1(d), previous is the result of bfs(a), b is the result of func_1(d), path_ba is a list containing b and all the values of previous at index path_ba[-1] until n is -1 and has at least ci1 + 4 elements, ops is a list containing (c1, i), (c2, i), (c1, i), (c2, i), (c1, i), (c1, i), (c2, i), ci2 is half the length of path_ba, ci1 is ci2 minus 1 and makes len(path_ba) - ci1 an odd number, c1 is the value at index ci1 in path_ba, c2 is the value at index ci2 in path_ba, i is at least 5, and stdin contains -2(n-1) - 2 inputs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
