Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, u2vs is a list of n empty lists, stdin contains 0 inputs
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n - 1):
    u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    u -= 1
    v -= 1
    u2vs[u].append(v)
    u2vs[v].append(u)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than 1, u2vs is a list of n lists where the list at index u and the list at index v each contain the integer that is the other index, u is an integer equal to the first input integer minus 1, v is an integer equal to the second input integer minus 1, _ is 0, stdin contains -2 inputs

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer greater than 2, u2vs is a list of n lists where the list at index u and the list at index v each contain the integer that is the other index, and the lists at indices u and v each contain an additional integer that is the other index, u is an integer equal to the first input integer minus 2, v is an integer equal to the second input integer minus 2, _ is 1, stdin contains no inputs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than 2, u2vs is a list of n lists where the list at index u and the list at index v each contain the integer that is the other index, and the lists at indices u and v each contain an additional integer that is the other index, u is an integer equal to the first input integer minus 3, v is an integer equal to the second input integer minus 3, _ is 2, stdin contains no inputs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
