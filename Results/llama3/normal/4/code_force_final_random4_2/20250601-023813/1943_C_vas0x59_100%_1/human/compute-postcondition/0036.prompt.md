Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: u2vs is a list of n lists where the list at index u and the list at index v each contain the integer that is the other index, and the lists at indices u and v each contain n-2 additional integers that are the other index, u is an integer equal to the first input integer minus n+1, v is an integer equal to the second input integer minus n+1, _ is n-1, d is the result of bfs(0), a is the result of func_1(d), previous is the result of bfs(a), b is the result of func_1(d), path_ba is a list containing b and all the values of previous at index path_ba[-1] until n is -1, ops is an empty list, ci is the integer division of the length of path_ba by 2, c is the value of path_ba at index ci, and stdin contains -2(n-1) - 2 inputs.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(ci + 1):
    ops.append((c, i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u and the list at index v each contain the integer that is the other index, and the lists at indices u and v each contain n-2 additional integers that are the other index, `u` is an integer equal to the first input integer minus n+1, `v` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus n+1, `_` is n-1, `d` is the result of bfs(0), `a` is the result of func_1(d), `previous` is the result of bfs(a), `b` is the result of func_1(d), `path_ba` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `ops` is a list containing the tuple (c, i), `ci` is at least 0, `c` is the value of `path_ba` at index `ci`, `i` is 0, and `stdin` contains -2(n-1) - 2 inputs.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u and the list at index v each contain the integer that is the other index, and the lists at indices u and v each contain n-2 additional integers that are the other index, `u` is an integer equal to the first input integer minus n+1, `v` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus n+1, `_` is n-1, `d` is the result of bfs(0), `a` is the result of func_1(d), `previous` is the result of bfs(a), `b` is the result of func_1(d), `path_ba` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `ops` is a list containing the tuple (c, i) and the tuple (c, i) where c is the value of `path_ba` at index `ci` and i is 1, `ci` is at least 0, `c` is the value of `path_ba` at index `ci`, `i` is 1, and `stdin` contains -2(n-1) - 2 inputs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u and the list at index v each contain the integer that is the other index, and the lists at indices u and v each contain n-2 additional integers that are the other index, `u` is an integer equal to the first input integer minus n+1, `v` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus n+1, `_` is n-1, `d` is the result of bfs(0), `a` is the result of func_1(d), `previous` is the result of bfs(a), `b` is the result of func_1(d), `path_ba` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `ops` is a list containing the tuple (c, i) and the tuple (c, i) and the tuple (c, i) where c is the value of `path_ba` at index `ci` and i is 2, `ci` is at least 1, `c` is the value of `path_ba` at index `ci`, `i` is 2, and `stdin` contains -2(n-1) - 2 inputs




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
