Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, u2vs is a list of n lists where the list at index u and the list at index v each contain the integer that is the other index, and the lists at indices u and v each contain n-2 additional integers that are the other index, u is an integer equal to the first input integer minus n+1, v is an integer equal to the second input integer minus n+1, _ is n-1, stdin contains -2(n-1) inputs.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed n-1 times, where n is the initial value of the variable n. After the loop finishes executing, the list u2vs will contain n lists, each representing a node in a graph, where the indices of the lists represent the nodes and the values in the lists represent the edges between the nodes. The variables u and v will hold the values of the last input integers minus n+1, and the variable _ will hold the value n-1, indicating the number of iterations of the loop. The stdin will contain -2(n-1) inputs, indicating that 2(n-1) inputs have been consumed by the loop.
