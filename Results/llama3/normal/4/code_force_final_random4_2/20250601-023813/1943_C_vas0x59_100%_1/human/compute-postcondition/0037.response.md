Postcondition: ***`u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u and the list at index v each contain the integer that is the other index, and the lists at indices u and v each contain n-2 additional integers that are the other index, `u` is an integer equal to the first input integer minus n+1, `v` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus n+1, `_` is n-1, `d` is the result of bfs(0), `a` is the result of func_1(d), `previous` is the result of bfs(a), `b` is the result of func_1(d), `path_ba` is a list containing b and all the values of `previous` at index `path_ba[-1]` until `n` is -1, `ops` is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or n is -1, stdin contains -2(n-1) - 2 inputs. The length of `path_ba` is even***
