Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, u2vs is a list of n lists where the list at index u and the list at index v each contain the integer that is the other index, and the lists at indices u and v each contain an additional integer that is the other index, u is an integer equal to the first input integer minus 3, v is an integer equal to the second input integer minus 3, _ is 2, stdin contains no inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `u2vs` is also unchanged except for the lists at indices `u` and `v`, which now contain an additional integer that is the other index. The values of `u` and `v` are decremented by 1, and the value of `_` remains unchanged as it is not used in the code. The stdin is empty as the inputs have been consumed by the code.
