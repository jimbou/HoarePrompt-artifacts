Output State: **The program returns None.**

The program does not perform any calculations or operations that affect the variables or values in the initial state. The return statement simply returns the value None, which is a special value in Python that represents the absence of a value. Therefore, the output state is that the program returns None, without any additional information or changes to the variables or values in the initial state.
