Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u and the list at index v each contain the integer that is the other index, and the lists at indices u and v each contain n-2 additional integers that are the other index, `u` is an integer equal to the first input integer minus n+1, `v` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus n+1, `_` is n-1, `d` is the result of bfs(0), `a` is the result of func_1(d), `previous` is the result of bfs(a), `b` is the result of func_1(d), `path_ba` is a list containing b, n, and the value of `previous` at index `path_ba[-1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or n is not -1, stdin contains -2(n-1) - 2 inputs, and `n` is the value of `previous` at index `path_ba[-1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `n` has been updated to be the value of `previous` at index `path_ba[-1]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
