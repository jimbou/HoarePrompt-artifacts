To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(n - 1):`. The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than the current iteration number, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an integer greater than 2, and `_` is 1.

For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than the current iteration number, which is 2. Since `_` is just a dummy variable, its value doesn't affect the loop execution.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u and the list at index v each contain the integer that is the other index, and the lists at indices u and v each contain an additional integer that is the other index, `u` is an integer equal to the first input integer minus 2, `v` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains no inputs.**
