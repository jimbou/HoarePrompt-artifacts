Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u and the list at index v each contain the integer that is the other index, and the lists at indices u and v each contain n-2 additional integers that are the other index, `u` is an integer equal to the first input integer minus n+1, `v` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus n+1, `_` is n-1, `d` is the result of bfs(0), `a` is the result of func_1(d), `previous` is the result of bfs(a), `b` is the result of func_1(d), `path_ba` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `ops` is a list containing the tuple (c, i), `ci` is at least 0, `c` is the value of `path_ba` at index `ci`, `i` is 0, and `stdin` contains -2(n-1) - 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the list `ops` has been updated to include the tuple `(c, i)`, where `c` is the value of `path_ba` at index `ci` and `i` is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
