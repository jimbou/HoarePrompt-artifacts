Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= n, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `c` is a list of integers of length `n`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n+1` where `suff[0]` is equal to `suff[1] + c[0]`, `suff[1]` is equal to `suff[2] + c[1]`, ..., `suff[n-1]` is equal to `suff[n] + c[n-1]`, `ans` is either positive infinity or the minimum of positive infinity, `a[0] + suff[1]`, `a[1] + suff[2]`, and `a[2] + suff[3]`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `a[2] + suff[3]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
