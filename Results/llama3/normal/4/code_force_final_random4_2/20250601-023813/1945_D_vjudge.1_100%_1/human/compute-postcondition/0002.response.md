Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `c` is a list of integers of length `n`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n+1` where `suff[n-1]` is equal to `suff[n] + c[n-1]`**

In this output state, the value of `suff[i]` has been updated to be the sum of `suff[i + 1]` and `c[i]`, where `i` is equal to `n-1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `suff` now has its element at index `n-1` updated to be the sum of the element at index `n` and the element at index `n-1` in the list `c`.
