To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= n.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `k` is already greater than or equal to 2, it does not need to be adjusted.

The other variables in the state, such as `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `suff`, and `ans`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= n, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `c` is a list of integers of length `n`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n+1` where `suff[0]` is equal to `suff[1] + c[0]`, `suff[1]` is equal to `suff[2] + c[1]`, ..., `suff[n-1]` is equal to `suff[n] + c[n-1]`, `ans` is either positive infinity or the minimum of positive infinity, `a[0] + suff[1]`, and `a[1] + suff[2]`.**
