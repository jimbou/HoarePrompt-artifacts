Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-2`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `c` is a list of integers of length `n`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n+1` where `suff[n-2]` is equal to `suff[n-1] + c[n-2]` and `suff[n-3]` is equal to `suff[n-2] + c[n-3]`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `suff` at index `i` (which is `n-2`) is updated to be the sum of the value of `suff` at index `i+1` (which is `n-1`) and the value of `c` at index `i` (which is `n-2`). The values of the other variables remain the same.
