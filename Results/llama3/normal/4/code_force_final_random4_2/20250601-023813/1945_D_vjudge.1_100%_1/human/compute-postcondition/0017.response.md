Output: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `k`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `c` is a list of integers of length `n`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n+1` where `suff[0]` is equal to `suff[1] + c[0]`, `suff[1]` is equal to `suff[2] + c[1]`, ..., `suff[n-1]` is equal to `suff[n] + c[n-1]`, `ans` is either positive infinity or the minimum of positive infinity and `a[j] + suff[j + 1]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, and the minimum value of `ans` is being printed**
