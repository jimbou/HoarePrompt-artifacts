Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `c` is a list of integers of length `n`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n+1` where `suff[0]` is equal to `suff[1] + c[0]`, `suff[1]` is equal to `suff[2] + c[1]`, ..., `suff[n-1]` is equal to `suff[n] + c[n-1]`, `ans` is either positive infinity or the minimum of positive infinity and `a[0] + suff[1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be either its original value of positive infinity or the minimum of positive infinity and `a[0] + suff[1]`. This means that `ans` will be positive infinity if `a[0] + suff[1]` is greater than positive infinity (which is not possible), or it will be `a[0] + suff[1]` if `a[0] + suff[1]` is less than positive infinity. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
