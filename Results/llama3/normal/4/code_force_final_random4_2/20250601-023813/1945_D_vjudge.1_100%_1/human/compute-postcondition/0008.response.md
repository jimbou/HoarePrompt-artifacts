Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is -1, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `c` is a list of integers of length `n`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n+1` where `suff[0]` is equal to `suff[1] + c[0]`, `suff[1]` is equal to `suff[2] + c[1]`, ..., `suff[n-1]` is equal to `suff[n] + c[n-1]`, `ans` is positive infinity.**

In this output state, all variables from the initial state remain unchanged, except for `ans`, which is now assigned the value of positive infinity. This is because the code `ans = float('inf')` explicitly sets `ans` to this value. The other variables, including `n`, `i`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `suff`, retain their original values and properties as specified in the initial state.
