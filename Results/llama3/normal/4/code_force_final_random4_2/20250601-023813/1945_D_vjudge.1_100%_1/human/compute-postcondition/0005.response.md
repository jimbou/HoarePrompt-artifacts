The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is decreased by 1 so `i` is `n-3` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-3`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `c` is a list of integers of length `n`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n+1` where `suff[n-3]` is equal to `suff[n-2] + c[n-3]` and `suff[n-4]` is equal to `suff[n-3] + c[n-4]`**
