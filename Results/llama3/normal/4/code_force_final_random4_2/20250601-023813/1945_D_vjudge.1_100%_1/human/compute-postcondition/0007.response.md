Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is -1, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `c` is a list of integers of length `n`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n+1` where `suff[0]` is equal to `suff[1] + c[0]`, `suff[1]` is equal to `suff[2] + c[1]`, ..., `suff[n-1]` is equal to `suff[n] + c[n-1]`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be -1 (since it starts at `n-1` and decrements by 1 in each iteration), and the `suff` list will have been updated such that each element `suff[i]` is equal to the sum of the corresponding element in the `c` list and the next element in the `suff` list. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `c`) remain unchanged.
