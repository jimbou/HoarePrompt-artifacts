The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is -1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `c` is a list of integers of length `n`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n+1` where `suff[0]` is equal to `suff[1] + c[0]`, `suff[1]` is equal to `suff[2] + c[1]`, ..., `suff[n-1]` is equal to `suff[n] + c[n-1]`, `ans` is positive infinity does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `c` is a list of integers of length `n`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n+1` where `suff[0]` is equal to `suff[1] + c[0]`, `suff[1]` is equal to `suff[2] + c[1]`, ..., `suff[n-1]` is equal to `suff[n] + c[n-1]`, `ans` is positive infinity**
