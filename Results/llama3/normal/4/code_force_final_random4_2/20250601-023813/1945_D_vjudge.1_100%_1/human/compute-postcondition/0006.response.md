Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-3`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `c` is a list of integers of length `n`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n+1` where `suff[n-3]` is equal to `suff[n-2] + c[n-3]`, `suff[n-4]` is equal to `suff[n-3] + c[n-4]`, and `suff[n-3-1]` is equal to `suff[n-3] + c[n-3-1]`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 2, `i` is still `n-3`, `k` is still an integer between 1 and `n`, `a` and `b` are still lists of integers of length `n`, `c` is still a list of integers of length `n`, and `suff` is still a list of integers of length `n+1`. The values of `suff[n-3]` and `suff[n-4]` are still equal to `suff[n-2] + c[n-3]` and `suff[n-3] + c[n-4]` respectively. Additionally, the value of `suff[n-3-1]` is now equal to `suff[n-3] + c[n-3-1]`.
