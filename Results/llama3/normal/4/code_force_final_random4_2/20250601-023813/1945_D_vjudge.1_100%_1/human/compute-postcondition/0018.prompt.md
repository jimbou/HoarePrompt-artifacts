You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, a and b are lists of integers of length n such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 and 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all i.
    c = [min(a[i], b[i]) for i in range(n)]
    suff = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]
        
    #State: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is -1, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `c` is a list of integers of length `n`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n+1` where `suff[0]` is equal to `suff[1] + c[0]`, `suff[1]` is equal to `suff[2] + c[1]`, ..., `suff[n-1]` is equal to `suff[n] + c[n-1]`.
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k):
        ans = min(ans, a[i] + suff[i + 1])
        
    #State: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `k`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `c` is a list of integers of length `n`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n+1` where `suff[0]` is equal to `suff[1] + c[0]`, `suff[1]` is equal to `suff[2] + c[1]`, ..., `suff[n-1]` is equal to `suff[n] + c[n-1]`, `ans` is either positive infinity or the minimum of positive infinity and `a[j] + suff[j + 1]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `k-1`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: Either positive infinity or the minimum of positive infinity and the sum of a[j] and suff[j + 1] for all j in the range from 0 to k-1 (where a and suff are lists of integers of length n)

```

Return Postconditions: 

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
