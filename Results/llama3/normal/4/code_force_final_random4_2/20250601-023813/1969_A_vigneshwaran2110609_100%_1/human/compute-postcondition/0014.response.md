The value of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The number 2 is still being printed. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases. The values of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `x` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `i` is 1, `flag` is True, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `x` must be greater than 1, the number 2 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
