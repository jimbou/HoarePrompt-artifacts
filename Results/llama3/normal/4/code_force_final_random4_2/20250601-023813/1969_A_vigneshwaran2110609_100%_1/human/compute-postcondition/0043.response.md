Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `x` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `i` is 2, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, the number 2 or 3 was printed. If `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1`, then `flag` is True, the number 2 is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, nothing happens.***
