Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive and must be at least `x+2`, `x` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `i` is `x+1`, `flag` is True, stdin contains `t-8` test cases, the number 2 or 3 was printed, and the number 2 is printed, and the number 2 is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `n`, `x`, `l`, `i`, and `flag` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t-8` test cases. The numbers 2 or 3, 2, and 2 were printed before breaking out of the loop or if statement.
