Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `x` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `i` is 1, `flag` is True, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `x` must be greater than 1.**

In this output state, a new variable `flag` has been introduced and assigned the value True. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `x` must be greater than 1 is still valid, and the stdin still contains t-2 test cases.
