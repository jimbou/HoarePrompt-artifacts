Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `x` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-2` test cases, `x` must be greater than 0. The current value of `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `i + 1`, and `flag` is `True`, and the number 2 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `n`, `x`, `l`, `i`, `flag`, and the stdin remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
