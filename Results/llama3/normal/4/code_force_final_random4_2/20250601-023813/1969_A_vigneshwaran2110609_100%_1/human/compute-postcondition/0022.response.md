Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, l is a list of n distinct integers, i is x, stdin contains t-2 test cases, if l[l[i] - 1] equals i + 1 for any i in range(0, x), then the number 2 is printed, flag is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the number 3 is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop variable `i` has reached the value of `x`, and the list `l` and the input from `stdin` remain unchanged. If at any point during the loop iterations the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` was true, then the number 2 was printed, the flag was set to True, and the loop was exited. If this condition was never true, then the number 3 is printed after the loop finishes.
