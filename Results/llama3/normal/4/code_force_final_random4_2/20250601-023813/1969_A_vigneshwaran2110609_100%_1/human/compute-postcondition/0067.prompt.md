Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n distinct integers p_i (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    x = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    for i in range(0, x):
        if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
            flag = True
            print(2)
            break
    else:
        print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, l is a list of n distinct integers, i is x, stdin contains t-2 test cases, if l[l[i] - 1] equals i + 1 for any i in range(0, x), then the number 2 is printed, flag is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the number 3 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `x` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive and must be at least `x`, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `i` is `x`, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, the number 2 or 3 was printed. If `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1` for any `i` in the range `[0, x)`, then `flag` is True, the number 2 is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, nothing happens.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive and must be at least x+1, x is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive and must be at least x+1, l is a list of n distinct integers, i is x, flag is True, stdin contains t-5 test cases, the number 2 or 3 was printed. If l[l[i] - 1] equals i + 1 for any i in the range [0, x) then flag is True, the number 2 is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, nothing happens.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
