Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n distinct integers p_i (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i).**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 2 and 50 inclusive. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n and n distinct integers p_i.
