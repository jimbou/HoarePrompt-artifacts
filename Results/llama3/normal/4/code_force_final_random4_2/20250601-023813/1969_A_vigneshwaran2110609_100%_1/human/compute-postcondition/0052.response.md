Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive and must be at least `x+1`, `x` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `i` is within the range [0, `x`), `flag` is True, stdin contains `t-6` test cases, the number 2 or 3 was printed, and the number 2 is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `n`, `x`, `l`, `i`, and `flag` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement we were directly inside.
