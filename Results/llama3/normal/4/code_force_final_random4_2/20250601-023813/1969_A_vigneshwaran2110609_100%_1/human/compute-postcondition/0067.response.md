Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive and must be at least x+t-1, x is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive and must be at least x+t-1, l is a list of n distinct integers, i is x, flag is True, stdin contains 0 test cases, the number 2 or 3 was printed. If l[l[i] - 1] equals i + 1 for any i in the range [0, x) then flag is True, the number 2 is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, nothing happens.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` and `x` will be at least `x+t-1`, where `t` is the number of test cases. The list `l` will still contain `n` distinct integers, and the variable `i` will be equal to `x`. The flag will be `True`, and there will be no more test cases left in the standard input. The number 2 or 3 will have been printed, depending on whether the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` was met for any `i` in the range `[0, x)`.
