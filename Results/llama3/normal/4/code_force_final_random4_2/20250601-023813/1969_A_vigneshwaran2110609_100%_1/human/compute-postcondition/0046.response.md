Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive and must be at least x+1, x is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive and must be at least x+1, l is a list of n distinct integers, i is x+1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, the number 2 or 3 was printed. If l[l[i] - 1] equals i + 1 for any i in the range [0, x) then flag is True, the number 2 is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, nothing happens.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to the integer value of the input, and `l` has been assigned a list of `n` distinct integers from the input. The value of `i` remains `x+1`. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1. The condition for `flag` and the printing of the number 2 or 3 remains the same.
