Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The program iterates through the list of friends and checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (i.e., p_i equals the index i + 1). If such a pair is found, it prints 2, indicating that only 2 invitations are needed to get at least 2 friends to the party. If no such pair is found, it prints 3, indicating that at least 3 invitations are needed.

The program correctly handles the edge case where the number of friends is 2, in which case it prints 2. It also correctly handles the case where there are no pairs of friends who are each other's best friends, in which case it prints 3.

The execution summary accurately describes the behavior of the program, and the program produces the correct output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
