Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `x` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive and must be at least 2, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, and the number 2 or 3 is printed, and `flag` is True.**

The code does not change the values of any variables, so the output state is the same as the initial state. The variable `flag` is already True in the initial state, and the code does not modify it. Therefore, the output state includes all the information from the initial state, with no changes.
