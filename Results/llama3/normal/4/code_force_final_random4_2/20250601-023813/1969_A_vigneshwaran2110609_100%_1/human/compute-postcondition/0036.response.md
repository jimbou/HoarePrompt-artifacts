Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `x` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive and must be at least 2, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, the number 2 or 3 was printed, `flag` is True, and this is printed: 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `x`, `l`, `i`, `flag`, and the printed numbers remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains `t-4` test cases.
