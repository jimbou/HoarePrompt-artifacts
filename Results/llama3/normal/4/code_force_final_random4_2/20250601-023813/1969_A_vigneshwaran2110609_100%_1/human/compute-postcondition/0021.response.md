Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, x is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, l is a list of n distinct integers, i is 2, stdin contains t-2 test cases, x must be greater than 2. If l[l[i] - 1] equals i + 1, then the number 2 is printed, flag is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
