Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `x` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive and must be at least 1, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, flag is True, and the number 2 or 3 is printed. The current value of `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `i + 1`, and the number 2 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `n`, `x`, `l`, `i`, `stdin`, `flag`, and the printed number remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
