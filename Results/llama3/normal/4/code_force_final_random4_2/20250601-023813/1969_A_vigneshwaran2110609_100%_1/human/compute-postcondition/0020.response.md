Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `x` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `i` is 2, `flag` is True, stdin contains `t-2` test cases, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `x`, `l`, `i`, and `flag` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-2` test cases. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the program will exit the current loop or conditional block.
