Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `x` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive and must be at least 1, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, flag is True, and the number 2 or 3 is printed. If the current value of `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `i + 1`, the number 2 is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the if statement does not execute any specific action.***
