Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, l is a list of n distinct integers, i is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, x must be greater than 1. If l[l[i] - 1] equals i + 1, then the number 2 is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and flag is True. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
