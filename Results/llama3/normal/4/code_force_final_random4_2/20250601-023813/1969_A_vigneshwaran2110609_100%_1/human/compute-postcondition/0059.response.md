Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive and must be at least `x+1`, `x` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `i` is `x`, `flag` is True, stdin contains `t-8` test cases, the number 2 or 3 was printed, and the number 2 is printed. If `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `i + 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
