Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `x` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-2` test cases, `x` must be greater than 0. The current value of `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `i + 1`, and `flag` is `True`.**

In this output state, all the initial conditions are still valid, and a new variable `flag` is introduced with the value `True`. The value of `flag` is now known, but the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
