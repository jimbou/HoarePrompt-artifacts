According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n distinct integers p_i (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i). So for the loop to be executed  the `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n distinct integers p_i (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
