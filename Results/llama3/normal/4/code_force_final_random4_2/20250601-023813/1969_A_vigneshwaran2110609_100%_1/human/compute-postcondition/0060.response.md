The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `x`, `x` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is `x+1` and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than `x+1` but `x` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive so `x` is `x+1` and `x+1` is between 2 and 51 inclusive.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive and must be at least `x+2`, `x` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `i` is `x+1`, `flag` is True, stdin contains `t-8` test cases, the number 2 or 3 was printed, and the number 2 is printed.**
