Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive and must be at least `x+1`, `x` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `i` is within the range [0, `x`). The current value of `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `i + 1`. stdin contains `t-5` test cases, the number 2 or 3 was printed, flag is False***
