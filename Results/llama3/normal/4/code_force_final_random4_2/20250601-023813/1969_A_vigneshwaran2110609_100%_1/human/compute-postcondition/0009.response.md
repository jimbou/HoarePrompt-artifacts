Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, l is a list of n distinct integers, i is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, x must be greater than 0. If the current value of l[l[i] - 1] is equal to i + 1, then flag is True, the number 2 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
