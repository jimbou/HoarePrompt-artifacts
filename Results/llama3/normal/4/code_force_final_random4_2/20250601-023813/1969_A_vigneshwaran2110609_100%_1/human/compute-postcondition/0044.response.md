Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `x` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive and must be at least `x`, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `i` is `x`, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, the number 2 or 3 was printed. If `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1` for any `i` in the range `[0, x)`, then `flag` is True, the number 2 is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, nothing happens.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `n`, `l`, and stdin as in the initial state. The value of `x` will remain the same, but it must be at least equal to its initial value. The value of `i` will be equal to `x`. The number 2 or 3 will be printed. If the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` is true for any `i` in the range `[0, x)`, then `flag` will be True, the number 2 will be printed, and the loop will break. Otherwise, nothing will happen.
