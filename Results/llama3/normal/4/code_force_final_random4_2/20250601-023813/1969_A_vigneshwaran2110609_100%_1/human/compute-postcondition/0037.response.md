Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `x` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive and must be at least 2, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, the number 2 or 3 was printed, and either `flag` is True and 2 is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or nothing happens.***
