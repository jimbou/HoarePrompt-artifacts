Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `x` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `i` is 2, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, the number 2 or 3 was printed, `flag` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the number 2 is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code simply breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, without changing the values of any variables. The values of `n`, `x`, `l`, `i`, `flag`, and the contents of stdin remain the same. The only additional effect is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement again.
