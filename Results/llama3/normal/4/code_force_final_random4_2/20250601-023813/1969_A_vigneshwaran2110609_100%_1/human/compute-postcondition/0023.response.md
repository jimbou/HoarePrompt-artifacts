State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, l is a list of n distinct integers, i is x + 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, if l[l[i] - 1] equals i + 1 for any i in range(0, x), then the number 2 is printed, flag is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the number 3 is printed.**
