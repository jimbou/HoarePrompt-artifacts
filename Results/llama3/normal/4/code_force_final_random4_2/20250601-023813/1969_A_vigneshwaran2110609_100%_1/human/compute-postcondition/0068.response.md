Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n distinct integers. It then checks if there exists an integer p_i in the list such that p_i equals the index i + 1. If such an integer is found, it prints 2 and breaks out of the loop. If no such integer is found, it prints 3. The function repeats this process for all test cases and then terminates.**
