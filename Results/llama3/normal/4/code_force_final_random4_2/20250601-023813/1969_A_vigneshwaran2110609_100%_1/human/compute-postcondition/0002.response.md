Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, l is a list of n distinct integers, i is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

The code executes two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `x`. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `x` also becomes an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive. The second line assigns a list of `n` distinct integers to `l`. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `l` becomes a list of `n` distinct integers. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1, so stdin now contains `t-2` test cases.
