Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, l is a list of n distinct integers, i is x + 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, flag is True, and the number 2 or 3 is printed.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `x`. Since `x` was an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, it remains an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `l`. Since `l` was a list of `n` distinct integers, it remains a list of `n` distinct integers. The value of `n` is not affected by the code. The value of `i` is not directly affected by the code, but since `i` is `x + 1`, its value is updated indirectly. The value of `flag` is not directly affected by the code, but since the code checks if `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1` for any `i` in range(0, `x`), if this condition is met, `flag` becomes `True`. The number 2 or 3 is printed depending on the condition. Stdin now contains `t-4` test cases.
