Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `x` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive and must be at least 3, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `i` is 2, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, the number 2 or 3 was printed, `flag` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `flag` has been updated to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t-4` test cases.
