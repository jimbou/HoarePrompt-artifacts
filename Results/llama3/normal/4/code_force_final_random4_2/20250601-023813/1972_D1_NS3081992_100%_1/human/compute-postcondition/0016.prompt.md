Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, `processing` is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in `d`, `da` is an integer key in `d`, `rank` is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in `d`, and `tmp` is 1000000000. The length of the list associated with key `da` in `d` is more than 1.
Code of the loop:
for di in d[da]:
    if processing[di - 1] == 0:
        processing[di - 1] = 1
        tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
        processing[di - 1] = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, `processing` is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in `d`, `da` is an integer key in `d`, `rank` is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in `d`, `tmp` is an integer less than or equal to 1000000000, and `d[da]` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `di` is the first element in the list `d[da]`. If `processing[di - 1]` is 0, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, `processing` is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in `d`, `da` is an integer key in `d`, `rank` is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in `d`, `tmp` is an integer less than or equal to 1000000000, and `d[da]` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `di` is the second element in the list `d[da]`. If `processing[di - 1]` is 0, `tmp` is updated to the minimum of its original value and the return value of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, `processing` is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in `d`, `da` is an integer key in `d`, `rank` is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in `d`, `tmp` is an integer less than or equal to 1000000000, `d[da]` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `di` is the third element in the list `d[da]`. If `processing[di - 1]` is 0, `tmp` is the minimum of its original value and the return value of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
