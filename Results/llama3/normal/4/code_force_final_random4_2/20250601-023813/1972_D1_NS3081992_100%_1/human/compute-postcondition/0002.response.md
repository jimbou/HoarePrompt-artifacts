The only objects in the loop head are variables  _ and the function func_10(), so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the func_10().  If the func_10() returns at least 2 the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, func_10() still returns a positive integer. So for the loop to be executed one more time the func_10() must return at least 2 and the _ is 1.
State: **The standard output contains a string representation of the return value of `func_15()` followed by a newline character, and `func_10()` still returns at least 2, _ is 1**
