Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(a), `m` is a non-negative integer, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` is decreased by `m - a[i]` for each `i` in range `n` where `a[i]` is less than `m`. `k` is less than 0***
