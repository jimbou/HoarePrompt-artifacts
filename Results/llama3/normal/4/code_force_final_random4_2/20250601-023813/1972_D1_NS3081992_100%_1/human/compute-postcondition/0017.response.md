Output State: **`d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, `processing` is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in `d`, `da` is an integer key in `d`, `rank` is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in `d`, `tmp` is an integer less than or equal to 1000000000, and `d[da]` is a list of integers with at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop, `di` is the last element in the list `d[da]`. If `processing[di - 1]` is 0, `tmp` is the minimum of its original value and the return value of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`, `rank[da - 1]` is `tmp + 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The dictionary `d`, the list `processing`, the integer key `da`, the list `rank`, the integer `tmp`, and the list `d[da]` remain unchanged. The value of `rank[da - 1]` is updated to be one more than the value of `tmp`. The value of `tmp` is still less than or equal to 1000000000. The value of `di` is still the last element in the list `d[da]`.
