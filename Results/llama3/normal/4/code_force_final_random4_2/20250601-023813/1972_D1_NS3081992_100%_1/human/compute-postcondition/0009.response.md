Functionality: This function calculates the sum of the integer divisions of (n + j) by (j * j) for all j from 1 to i - 1, where i is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 2 such that i * i > n + i or i > m, and returns this sum minus 1. The function takes no parameters and returns an integer value. The input variables n and m are not modified by the function.
