Output State: **The standard output contains a string representation of the return value of `func_15()` followed by a newline character, and then another string representation of the return value of `func_15()` followed by a newline character, and then another string representation of the return value of `func_15()` followed by a newline character, and `func_10()` still returns at least 2, `_` is 2**

In this output state, the standard output has been updated to include an additional string representation of the return value of `func_15()` followed by a newline character. The other conditions remain the same, with `func_10()` still returning at least 2 and `_` still being 2.
