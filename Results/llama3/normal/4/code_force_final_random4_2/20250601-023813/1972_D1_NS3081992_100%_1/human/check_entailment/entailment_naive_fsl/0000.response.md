Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The program calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
* a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

The program uses a while loop to iterate over all possible values of i, where i is the divisor of b. For each i, it calculates the number of possible values of a that satisfy the conditions and adds it to the total count.

The program correctly handles the case where n or m is 1, and it also correctly handles the case where n and m are large numbers.

The program's time complexity is O(m * log(m)), which is efficient enough to handle the given constraints.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
