Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a list of a specified length, where each element is the result of calling the function func_7(). The length of the list is determined by the input parameter 'rows', which is a positive integer. The function returns this list, with the exact values of its elements depending on the outcome of calling func_7() repeatedly.

        #The program returns integer 1
    #State: *`d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, `processing` is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in `d`, `da` is an integer key in `d`, `rank` is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in `d`, and `tmp` is 1000000000. The length of the list associated with key `da` in `d` is more than 1.

If `processing[di - 1]` is 0, `tmp` is the minimum of its original value and the return value of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns a rank value based on the input dictionary `d`, list `processing`, key `da`, and list `rank`. If the list associated with key `da` in `d` has only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the list, updating the `processing` list and calculating a temporary minimum value `tmp` by recursively calling `func_12` for each element. The function then updates the `rank` list with the calculated `tmp` value plus 1 and returns this value.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.

    #State: a and b are positive integers, and b is not equal to 0

    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns a tuple containing three values: y, x - a // b * y, and g. Here, y, x, and g are the values returned by the function func_13(b, a % b), where a and b are positive integers and b is not equal to 0. The value of x - a // b * y is calculated using the values of x and y returned by func_13(b, a % b) and the integer division of a by b.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers a and b, along with the coefficients x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b). If b is 0, it returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively calls another function func_13 with swapped and reduced arguments (b, a % b) and returns the calculated coefficients and GCD.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(a), m is a non-negative integer, and k is a non-negative integer.

    #State: `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(a), `m` is a non-negative integer, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` is decreased by `m - a[i]` for each `i` in range `n` where `a[i]` is less than `m`.
    if (k >= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1.
    #State: *`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(a), `m` is a non-negative integer, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` is decreased by `m - a[i]` for each `i` in range `n` where `a[i]` is less than `m`. `k` is less than 0
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, which is a negative integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers `a`, and non-negative integers `n`, `m`, and `k` as input. It iterates over the first `n` elements of `a` and decreases `k` by the difference between `m` and each element that is less than `m`. If `k` remains non-negative after this process, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function does not modify the input list `a`.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, i is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 2 such that i * i > n + i or i > m, ans is the original value of ans plus the sum of (n + j) // (j * j) for all j from 1 to i - 1
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the original value of ans plus the sum of (n + j) // (j * j) for all j from 1 to i - 1, minus 1, where n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, and i is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 2 such that i * i > n + i or i > m.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function calculates the sum of the integer divisions of (n + j) by (j * j) for all j from 1 to a certain limit, subtracts 1 from the result, and returns the value. The limit is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 2 such that i * i > n + i or i > m, where n and m are positive integers. The function takes no parameters and returns an integer value.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function func_10() returns a positive integer, and the function func_15() returns a value that can be converted to a string.
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: The standard output contains a string representation of the return value of `func_15()` followed by a newline character, repeated `func_10()` times, and `func_10()` still returns a positive integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function repeatedly writes the string representation of the return value of `func_15()` followed by a newline character to the standard output, with the number of repetitions determined by the return value of `func_10()`, which is a positive integer.
