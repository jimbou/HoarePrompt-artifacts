To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(func_10()):`. The objects involved are `_` and `func_10()`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the return value of `func_10()`. If `func_10()` returns at least 2, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `func_10()` still returns at least 2.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 2. Additionally, `func_10()` must still return at least 2.

State: **The standard output contains a string representation of the return value of `func_15()` followed by a newline character, and then another string representation of the return value of `func_15()` followed by a newline character, and `func_10()` still returns at least 2, `_` is 2**
