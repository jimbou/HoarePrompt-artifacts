Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    func_16()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  Reads a positive integer from standard input and returns it as an integer.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  Reads a line of input from the standard input, splits it into two space-separated integers, converts them to integers, and returns a map object containing these two positive integers.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  Reads a line of input from standard input, splits it into two space-separated integers, converts them to integers, and returns them as a list. The returned integers are guaranteed to be positive and less than or equal to 2 * 10^6.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function generates a list by repeatedly calling the function `func_3()` a specified number of times, equal to the value of `rows_number`, and returns this list. The function does not modify the input variable `rows_number`.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  Reads a line of input from standard input (stdin), removes the trailing newline byte, and returns the resulting bytes object.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  Reads a line from standard input, decodes it, removes trailing characters, and returns the resulting string.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function takes a string of two space-separated positive integers as input, parses it, and returns a list of two positive integers.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  This function generates a list of a specified length, where each element is the result of calling the function func_7(). The length of the list is determined by the input parameter 'rows', which is a positive integer. The function returns this list, with the exact values of its elements depending on the outcome of calling func_7() repeatedly.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  Reads a string from the standard input (stdin) and returns it as is, without any modifications or processing.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  Reads a positive integer from standard input and returns it as is, without any modifications or transformations.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function takes a string of two space-separated positive integers as input, splits it into two separate strings, and returns them as a list of two strings, each representing a positive integer.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  This function calculates and returns a rank value based on the input dictionary `d`, list `processing`, key `da`, and list `rank`. If the list associated with key `da` in `d` has only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the list, updating the `processing` list and calculating a temporary minimum value `tmp` by recursively calling `func_12` for each element. The function then updates the `rank` list with the calculated `tmp` value plus 1 and returns this value.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  This function calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers a and b, along with the coefficients x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b). If b is 0, it returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively calls another function func_13 with swapped and reduced arguments (b, a % b) and returns the calculated coefficients and GCD.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
    if k >= 0:
        return 1
    return -1
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  This function takes a list of non-negative integers `a`, and non-negative integers `n`, `m`, and `k` as input. It iterates over the first `n` elements of `a` and decreases `k` by the difference between `m` and each element that is less than `m`. If `k` remains non-negative after this process, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function does not modify the input list `a`.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  Functionality: This function calculates the sum of the integer divisions of (n + j) by (j * j) for all j from 1 to a certain limit, subtracts 1 from the result, and returns the value. The limit is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 2 such that i * i > n + i or i > m, where n and m are positive integers. The function takes no parameters and returns an integer value.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function repeatedly writes the string representation of the return value of `func_15()` followed by a newline character to the standard output, with the number of repetitions determined by the return value of `func_10()`, which is a positive integer.
