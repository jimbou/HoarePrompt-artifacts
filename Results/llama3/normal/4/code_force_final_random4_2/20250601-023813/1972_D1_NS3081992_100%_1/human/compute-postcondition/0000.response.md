To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `_` (a throwaway variable) and the function `func_10()`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value returned by `func_10()`. If `func_10()` returns a positive integer, the loop will execute.

Since `func_10()` returns a positive integer, we can adjust the state to reflect this. The variable `_` is not relevant to the loop's execution, so we don't need to adjust its state.

State: **`func_10()` returns a positive integer**
