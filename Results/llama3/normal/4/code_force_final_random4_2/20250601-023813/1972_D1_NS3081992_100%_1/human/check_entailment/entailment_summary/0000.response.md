Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a specific problem involving the calculation of the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying certain conditions. The program consists of multiple functions, each with its own specific task.

Function `func_1()` to `func_11()` are input/output functions that read input from the standard input and return it in various formats. These functions are used to read the number of test cases, the values of n and m, and other inputs.

Function `func_12()` is not relevant to the problem at hand and can be ignored.

Function `func_13()` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This function is used in the calculation of the number of ordered pairs.

Function `func_14()` is not relevant to the problem at hand and can be ignored.

Function `func_15()` is the main function that calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. It uses the GCD function `func_13()` to calculate the GCD of a and b, and then calculates the number of pairs using a loop.

Function `func_16()` is the main function that reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15()` for each test case, printing the result to the standard output.

Based on the provided execution summaries, the program correctly implements the required functionality. The input/output functions correctly read and return the input values, the GCD function correctly calculates the GCD, and the main function correctly calculates the number of ordered pairs.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
