Functionality: **This function takes a list of non-negative integers `a`, and non-negative integers `n`, `m`, and `k` as input. It iterates over the first `n` elements of `a` and decreases `k` by the difference between `m` and each element that is less than `m`. If `k` remains non-negative after this process, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function does not modify the input list `a`.**
