The variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`.  If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_tests` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, So for the loop to be executed one more time `num_tests` must be greater than 1.
State: **`num_tests` is greater than 1 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6, `start_year` is (((...(((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + ... + 1) // nums[n-1] + 1) * nums[n-1], `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 2 test cases, `x` is `n-1`, and the start_year is printed**
