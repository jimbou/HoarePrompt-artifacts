To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `nums`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. If `nums` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. 

Since `x` is the loop variable, it should be initialized to the starting value of the range, which is 0. 

The state of `nums` should be adjusted to ensure it has at least 1 element. 

The other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, `start_year`, and `stdin`) are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `nums` is a list of at least 1 integer between 1 and 10^6, `start_year` is 0, `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 2 test cases, `x` is 0**
