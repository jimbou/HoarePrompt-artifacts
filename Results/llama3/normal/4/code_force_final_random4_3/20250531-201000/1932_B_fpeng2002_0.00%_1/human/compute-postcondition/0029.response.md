The only objects in the loop head are variables  x and nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nums.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, nums has at least 2 elements, x is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the x is 2.
State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 that must have at least 3 elements, `start_year` is ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + (( ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1], `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 2 test cases, `x` is 2**
