To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for x in range(0, len(nums)):`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x` and the length of `nums`. If `x` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 0, and `nums` has at least 1 element. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be incremented by 1, so `x` becomes 1. The length of `nums` remains the same, but since `x` is now 1, `nums` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute again.

State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 that must have at least 2 elements, `start_year` is ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0], `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 2 test cases, `x` is 1**
