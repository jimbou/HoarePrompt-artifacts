To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for x in range(0, len(nums)):`. The objects involved are `x` and `nums`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 0, and `nums` is a list of at least 1 integer between 1 and 10^6.

For the loop to execute again, `x` needs to be incremented by 1, and `nums` needs to have at least one more element.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `x` is 1
* `nums` is a list of at least 2 integers between 1 and 10^6

The other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, `start_year`, and `stdin`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `nums` is a list of at least 2 integers between 1 and 10^6, `start_year` is ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0], `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 2 test cases, `x` is 1**
