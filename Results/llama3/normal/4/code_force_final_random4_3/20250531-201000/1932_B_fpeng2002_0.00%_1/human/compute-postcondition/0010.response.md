The code prints the value of `start_year` which is calculated based on the list `nums` and its elements. The `start_year` is calculated by iteratively applying a formula that involves the previous result, the current element of `nums`, and integer division. The formula starts with 0 and applies the operation `(...(((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + ... + 1) // nums[n-1] + 1) * nums[n-1]` for each element in `nums` from the first to the second last element.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is the calculated value based on the list nums and its elements)**
