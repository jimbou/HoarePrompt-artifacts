Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, based on the periodicities of the signs.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`) and then enters a loop to process each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities of the signs (`nums`).

3. It initializes a variable `start_year` to 0, which will keep track of the year in which the next sign is expected to occur.

4. The program then iterates over the periodicities of the signs. For each sign, it calculates the year in which the sign is expected to occur by using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This formula works as follows:
   - `start_year + 1` is the year after the previous sign has occurred.
   - `(start_year + 1) // nums[x]` calculates how many times the current sign's periodicity fits into the year after the previous sign.
   - `+ 1` increments this count by 1, effectively rounding up to the next occurrence of the sign.
   - `* nums[x]` multiplies this count by the sign's periodicity, giving the year in which the sign is expected to occur.

5. The program prints the final value of `start_year`, which is the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
