To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `nums`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `x` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 1, and `nums` is a list of at least 2 integers.

For the loop to execute again, `x` must be incremented by 1, so `x` becomes 2. The length of `nums` remains the same, but since `x` is now 2, `nums` must have at least 3 integers for the loop to execute again.

The other variables, `num_tests`, `n`, `start_year`, and `stdin`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `nums` is a list of at least 3 integers between 1 and 10^6, `start_year` is ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1], `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 2 test cases, `x` is 2**
