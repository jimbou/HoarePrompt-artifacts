Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the list of sign periodicities, updating the start year for each sign to be the next multiple of the sign's periodicity after the previous sign's occurrence. This ensures that each sign occurs sequentially, as required by the problem statement.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the examples provided in the problem statement. It also handles edge cases, such as when the periodicity of a sign is 1, in which case the start year is simply incremented by 1.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem statement work correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
