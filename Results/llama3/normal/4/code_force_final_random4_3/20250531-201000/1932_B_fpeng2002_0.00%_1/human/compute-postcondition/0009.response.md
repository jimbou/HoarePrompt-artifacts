Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, `start_year` is ((...(((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + ... + 1) // nums[n-1] + 1) * nums[n-1], `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is n-1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the value of `start_year` and `x`. The value of `start_year` is the result of the expression `((...(((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + ... + 1) // nums[n-1] + 1) * nums[n-1]`, which is the result of the loop body executed `n` times. The value of `x` is `n-1`, which is the last index of the `nums` list. The other variables, `num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, and `stdin`, remain unchanged.
