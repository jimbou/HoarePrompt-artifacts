To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `num_tests > 0`.

Given that `num_tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000, we can see that this condition is already guaranteed to be true for the first iteration because `num_tests` is at least 1.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state of `num_tests` or any other variables, as the loop condition is already satisfied.

State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).**
