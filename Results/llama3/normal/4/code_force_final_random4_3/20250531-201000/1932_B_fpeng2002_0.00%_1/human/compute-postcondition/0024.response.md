Output State: **num_tests is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value, n is an integer between 1 and 100, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, start_year is 0, stdin contains num_tests - 2 test cases, x is n-1, and the start_year is printed**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The number of tests has decreased by 1, and it is now two less than its original value. The value of n has been updated to an integer between 1 and 100, which is read from the input. The list nums now contains n integers between 1 and 10^6, which are also read from the input. The start_year variable has been reset to 0. The stdin still contains num_tests - 2 test cases. The value of x is now n-1. Finally, the start_year (which is 0) is printed.
