Output State: **num_tests is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 1 and 100, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, start_year is 0, stdin contains num_tests - 2 test cases, x is n-1.**

In this final state, `num_tests` has been decremented by 1, `n` has been reassigned to a new integer value between 1 and 100, `nums` has been reassigned to a new list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6, and `start_year` has been reset to 0. The value of `x` remains unchanged at `n-1`. The number of test cases in `stdin` has decreased by 2.
