The code prints the value of `start_year`, which is calculated based on the values in the `nums` list.

`start_year` is calculated by iteratively applying a formula to the elements of the `nums` list. The formula is `(((...(((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + ... + 1) // nums[n-1] + 1) * nums[n-1]`.

Since `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, the value of `start_year` will be a large integer.

However, without knowing the exact values of `nums`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `start_year`.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is a large integer calculated based on the values in the nums list)**
