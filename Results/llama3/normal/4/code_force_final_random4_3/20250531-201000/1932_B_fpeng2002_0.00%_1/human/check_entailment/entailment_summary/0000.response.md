Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. The program reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers representing the periodicities of the signs.

The program then calculates the start year for each test case by iteratively updating the start year based on the given integers. The update rule is as follows: for each sign, the start year is updated to be the smallest multiple of the sign's periodicity that is greater than the current start year.

The program's logic is correct because it accurately implements the problem's requirements. The update rule ensures that the start year for each sign is the smallest multiple of the sign's periodicity that is greater than the start year of the previous sign. This is in line with the problem's requirement that the signs must occur sequentially, with each sign occurring strictly after the previous one.

The program's use of integer division and multiplication to update the start year is also correct. The expression `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` calculates the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`. This is done by adding 1 to `start_year`, dividing by `nums[x]`, rounding down to the nearest integer, adding 1, and then multiplying by `nums[x]`.

Therefore, based on the provided execution summary, the program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
