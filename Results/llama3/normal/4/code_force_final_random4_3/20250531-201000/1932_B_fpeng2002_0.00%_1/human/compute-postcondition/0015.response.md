Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `nums` is a list of at least 1 integer between 1 and 10^6, `start_year` is ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0], `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 2 test cases, `x` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `start_year` has been updated based on the value of `nums[0]`, which is the first element of the list `nums`. The expression `((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]` calculates the new value of `start_year`. The other variables remain unchanged.
