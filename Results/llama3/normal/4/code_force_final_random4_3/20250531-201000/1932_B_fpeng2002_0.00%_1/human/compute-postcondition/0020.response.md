Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6, `start_year` is (((...(((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + ... + 1) // nums[n-1] + 1) * nums[n-1], `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 2 test cases, `x` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is:

The number of tests is one less than its original value, the number of integers in the list is between 1 and 100, the list contains `n` integers between 1 and 10^6, the start year is calculated by iteratively applying the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each integer in the list, the standard input contains `num_tests` - 2 test cases, and the loop counter `x` is `n-1`.
