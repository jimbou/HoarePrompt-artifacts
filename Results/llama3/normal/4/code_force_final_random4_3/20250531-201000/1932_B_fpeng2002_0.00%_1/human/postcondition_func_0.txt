This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then calculates the start year for each test case by iteratively updating the start year based on the given integers, and prints the final start year for each test case. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point the standard input is empty.
