The `print(start_year)` statement will print the value of `start_year`, which is the result of the loop body executed `n` times with the initial value of `start_year` being 0.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `start_year`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `start_year`.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is the result of the loop body executed n times with the initial value of start_year being 0)**
