Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 that must have at least 2 integers, `start_year` is ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2], `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of tests is between 0 and 999, the number of integers in the list is between 1 and 100, the list of integers has at least 2 integers between 1 and 10^6, the start year is calculated based on the first three integers in the list, there are `num_tests` - 1 test cases left in the standard input, and the value of `x` is 2.
