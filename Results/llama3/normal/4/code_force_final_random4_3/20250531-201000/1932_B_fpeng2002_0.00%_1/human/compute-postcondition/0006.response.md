Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 that must have at least 1 integer, `start_year` is ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1], `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is 1**

The value of `start_year` has been updated to be the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than the previous `start_year`. The other variables remain unchanged.
