To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for x in range(0, len(nums)):`. The objects involved are `x` and `nums`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 0, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 that must have at least 1 integer.

For the loop to execute again, `x` must be incremented by 1, and `nums` must still have at least 1 integer.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `x` is 1
* `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 that must have at least 1 integer

The other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, `start_year`, and `stdin`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 that must have at least 1 integer, `start_year` is ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0], `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is 1**
