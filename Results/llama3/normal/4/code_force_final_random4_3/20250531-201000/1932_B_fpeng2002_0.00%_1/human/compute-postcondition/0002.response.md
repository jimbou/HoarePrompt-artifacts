Output State: **num_tests is an integer between 0 and 999, n is an integer between 1 and 100, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, start_year is 0, stdin contains num_tests - 1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).**

The code first decrements `num_tests` by 1, reducing its value by 1. Then, it reads an integer `n` from stdin and assigns it to the variable `n`. The value of `n` is between 1 and 100. Next, it reads `n` integers from stdin, splits them into a list, and assigns it to the variable `nums`. The list `nums` contains `n` integers between 1 and 10^6. Finally, it initializes the variable `start_year` to 0. The remaining test cases in stdin are not affected by the code.
