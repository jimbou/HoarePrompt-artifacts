Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `nums` is a list of at least 3 integers between 1 and 10^6, `start_year` is ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2], `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 2 test cases, `x` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of tests is still greater than 0 and is one less than its original value. The value of `n` remains an integer between 1 and 100. The list `nums` still contains at least 3 integers between 1 and 10^6. The `start_year` has been updated to a new value based on the previous value and the value of `nums[2]`. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same. The value of `x` is still 2.
