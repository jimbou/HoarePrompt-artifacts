The variable in the loop head is variable num_tests, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable num_tests.  If num_tests is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, num_tests is an integer between 0 and 999, So for the loop to be executed one more time num_tests must be greater than 0.
State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, `start_year` is ((...(((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + ... + 1) // nums[n-1] + 1) * nums[n-1], `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is n-1, and the start year is printed, which is ((...(((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + ... + 1) // nums[n-1] + 1) * nums[n-1]**
