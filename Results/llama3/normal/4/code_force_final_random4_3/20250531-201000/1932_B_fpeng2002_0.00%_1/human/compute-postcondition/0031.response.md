Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, `start_year` is the result of the loop body executed n times with the initial value of `start_year` being 0, `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 2 test cases, `x` is n-1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `num_tests` remains two less than its original value, `n` remains an integer between 1 and 100, `nums` remains a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, `start_year` is the result of the loop body executed n times with the initial value of `start_year` being 0, `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 2 test cases, and `x` is n-1.
