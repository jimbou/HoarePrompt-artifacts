Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities of the signs `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
3. The program initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the year in which the first sign occurs.
4. The program then iterates over the periodicities of the signs. For each sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur by using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This formula ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous sign.
5. After iterating over all signs, the program prints the final `start_year`, which represents the year in which the nth sign occurs and the apocalypse happens.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, and the annotated program states match the expected states before and after the function call.

Correctness: **True**
