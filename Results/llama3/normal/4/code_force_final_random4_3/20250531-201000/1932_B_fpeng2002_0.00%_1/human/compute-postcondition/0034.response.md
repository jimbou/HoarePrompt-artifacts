Output State: **num_tests is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 100, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, start_year is the result of the loop body executed n times with the initial value of start_year being 0, stdin is empty, and x is n-1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the number of tests is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variables n, nums, and start_year retain their last values from the final iteration of the loop. The standard input (stdin) is empty because all test cases have been read and processed. The variable x is n-1, which is the last index of the nums list.
