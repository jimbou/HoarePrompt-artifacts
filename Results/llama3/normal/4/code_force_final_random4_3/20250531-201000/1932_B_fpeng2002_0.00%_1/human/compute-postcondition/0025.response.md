To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `nums`. The loop will execute if `nums` has at least one element, and `x` is within the range of indices for `nums`.

State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is 0, `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 2 test cases, `x` is 0**
