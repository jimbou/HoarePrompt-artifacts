Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `nums` is a list of at least 2 integers between 1 and 10^6, `start_year` is ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1], `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 2 test cases, `x` is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of tests is still greater than 0 and is one less than its original value. The value of n remains an integer between 1 and 100. The list of numbers, nums, still contains at least 2 integers between 1 and 10^6. The start year has been updated to a new value based on the previous start year and the second number in the list, nums. The standard input still contains `num_tests` - 2 test cases. The value of x remains 1.
