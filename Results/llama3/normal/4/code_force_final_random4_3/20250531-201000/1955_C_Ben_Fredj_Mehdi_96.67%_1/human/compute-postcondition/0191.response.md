Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `z` is an integer that equals `t`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that is at least 2, `a` is a list of integers where the first element is two less than its original value and the last element is two less than its original value, `d` is an integer equal to `len(a) - 1` if the last element of `a` is not 0, otherwise `d` is an integer equal to `len(a) - 2`, `g` is 1 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise `g` is 1, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `d` remain unchanged. The value of `g` is incremented by 1. If the first element of `a` is 0, then `g` is 1, otherwise `g` is 1. The number of test cases in stdin is `t-3` and `i` is 1.
