Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^15). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

In natural language, the output state is that the variable `t` has been assigned an integer value between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) from the input, and the remaining input in stdin still contains t test cases, each consisting of two lines with specific integer values.
