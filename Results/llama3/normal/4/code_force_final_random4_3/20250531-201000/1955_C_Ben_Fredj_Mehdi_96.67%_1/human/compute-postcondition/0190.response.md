Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), z is an integer that equals t, n is an integer, k is an integer that is at least 2, a is a list of integers where the first element is two less than its original value and the last element is two less than its original value, d is an integer equal to len(a) - 1 if the last element of a is not 0, otherwise d is an integer equal to len(a) - 2, if the first element of a is 0, then g is 1, otherwise g remains 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 1.**

In this output state, the values of t, z, n, k, and i remain unchanged. The list a has been modified such that its first and last elements are each decremented by 1. The value of d is determined based on the last element of a, and the value of g is determined based on the first element of a. The number of test cases in stdin remains t-3.
