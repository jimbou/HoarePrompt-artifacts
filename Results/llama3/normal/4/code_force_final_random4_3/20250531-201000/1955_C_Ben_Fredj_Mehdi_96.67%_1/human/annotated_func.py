#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^15). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).

    #State: t is an integer equal to 0, z is an integer equal to t, n is an integer equal to the first number in the first line of stdin, k is an integer equal to the second number in the first line of stdin, a is a list of integers from the second line of stdin, stdin is empty. If k equals 1999999998, 0 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 1999999999, the number 1 is printed. If k equals 99999999999, the number 99 is printed. If n equals 1, k equals 10000000000000, and a[0] equals 1, the number 1 is printed. If k equals 9999999999, the number 9 is printed. If n equals 101 and k equals 100000000000, the number 1 is printed. If k equals 10000000000000, the number 10000 is printed. If k equals 199999999999999, the number 199999 is printed. If k equals 1000000000000, the number 1000 is printed. If k equals 200000000000, the number 200 is printed. If k equals 2147483648 and n equals 2, the number 2 is printed. If n equals 2, k equals 1000000000, and a equals [1000000000, 1000000000], the number 0 is printed. If n equals 5 and k equals 2147483648, the number 2 is printed. If n equals 20 and k equals 10000000000, the number 10 is printed. If k equals 5999999999, the number 5 is printed. If k equals 4294967295, the number 8 is printed. If n equals 2 and k equals a[0] - 1 and k equals a[1] - 2, the number 0 is printed. If k equals 3000000000, the number 2 is printed. If k is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in list a, the length of the list a is printed. If k is less than the sum of the elements in list a, the first and last elements of list a are decremented by k // 2 if no exception occurs, otherwise the loop or if statement is broken. If the last element of a is not 0, d is the length of a minus 1, otherwise d is the length of a minus 2. g is k // 2 if the first element of a is 0 and all elements of a up to index g are 0, otherwise g is the index of the first non-zero element in a. i is k // 2 - 1. If k is odd, a[g] is decremented by 1, and the number of occurrences of 0 in the list a is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output. It reads an integer t, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it reads two integers n and k, and a list of n integers a. It then checks various conditions based on the values of n, k, and a, and prints a specific number based on these conditions. If k is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in list a, it prints the length of the list a. If k is less than the sum of the elements in list a, it decrements the first and last elements of list a by k // 2, and then prints the number of occurrences of 0 in the list a. If k is odd, it decrements the first non-zero element in list a by 1 before printing the number of occurrences of 0. The function repeats this process for each test case and then exits.
