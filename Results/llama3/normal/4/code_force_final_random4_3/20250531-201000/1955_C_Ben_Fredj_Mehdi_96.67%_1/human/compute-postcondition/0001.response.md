To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and `z` in the loop head.


According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), which ensures that the loop will execute. However, we need to adjust the state of `z` to reflect that it will take on values from 0 to `t-1` during the loop execution.


State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases, `z` is an integer that will take on values from 0 to `t-1`**
