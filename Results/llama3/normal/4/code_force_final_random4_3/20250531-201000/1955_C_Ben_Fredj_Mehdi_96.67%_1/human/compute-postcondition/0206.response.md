Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), z is an integer that equals t, n is an integer, k is an odd integer that is at least 2, a is a list of integers where the first element is k//2 less than its original value and the last element is k//2 less than its original value, d is an integer equal to len(a) - 1 if the last element of a is not 0, otherwise d is an integer equal to len(a) - 2, if the first element of a is 0, then g is 1, otherwise g remains 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is k//2 - 1.**
