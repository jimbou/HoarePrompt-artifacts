The `try` block attempts to decrement the first and last elements of the list `a` by 1. If the first element becomes 0, the variable `g` is incremented by 1. If the last element becomes 0, the variable `d` is decremented by 1.

The `except` block catches any exception that occurs during the execution of the `try` block and breaks out of the innermost loop or statement.

The output state after the execution of the `try` statement is:

* `t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive)
* `z` is an integer equal to `t+1`
* `n` is an integer equal to the first number in the first line of stdin
* `k` is an integer equal to the second number in the first line of stdin and must be at least 2
* `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin with the first and last elements decremented by 1
* `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 1, or the length of `a` minus 2 if the last element of `a` is 0
* `g` is 1 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise it is 0
* `i` is 0
* stdin contains `t-5` test cases

If an exception occurs during the execution of the `try` block, the program breaks out of the innermost loop or statement, and the state remains unknown.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `z` is an integer equal to `t+1`, `n` is an integer equal to the first number in the first line of stdin, `k` is an integer equal to the second number in the first line of stdin and must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin with the first and last elements decremented by 1, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 1, or the length of `a` minus 2 if the last element of `a` is 0, `g` is 1 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise it is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-5` test cases. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the innermost loop or statement, and the state remains unknown.**
