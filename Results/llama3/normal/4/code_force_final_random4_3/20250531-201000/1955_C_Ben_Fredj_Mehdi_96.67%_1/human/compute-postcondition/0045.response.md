Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), z is an integer that will take on values from 0 to t-1, n is an integer, k is an integer equal to 200000000000, a is a list of integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and k is not equal to 99999999999. Additionally, either n is not equal to 1, or the first element of a is not equal to 1. Also, either n is not equal to 101, or k is not equal to 100000000000. k is not equal to 10000000000000. k is not equal to 99999999999999. k is not equal to 199999999999999. k is not equal to 1000000000000. The current value of k is 200000000000, and '200' is being printed**
