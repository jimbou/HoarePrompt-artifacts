Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `z` is an integer equal to `t+1`, `n` is an integer equal to the first number in the first line of stdin, `k` is an integer equal to the second number in the first line of stdin and must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin with the first and last elements decremented by 2, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 1, or the length of `a` minus 2 if the last element of `a` is 0, `g` is 2 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise it is 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-5` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `g` has been incremented by 1. If the first element of `a` is 0, then `g` is now 2; otherwise, it is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
