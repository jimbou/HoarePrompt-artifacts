Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), z is an integer that equals t+1, n is an integer equal to the first number in the first line of stdin, k is an integer equal to the second number in the first line of stdin, a is a list of integers from the second line of stdin, stdin contains t-5 test cases.**

The code first reads a line from stdin and assigns the first number to `n` and the second number to `k`. Then, it reads another line from stdin, splits it into integers, and assigns the result to `a`. The value of `t` and `z` remains unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 2.
