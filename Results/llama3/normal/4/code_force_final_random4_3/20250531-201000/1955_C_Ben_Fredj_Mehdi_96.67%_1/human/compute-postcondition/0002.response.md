The first line assigns the first input from stdin to `a`. The second line assigns the integer value of the first part of `a` to `n`. The third line assigns the integer value of the second part of `a` to `k`. The fourth line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `a`. 

Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and stdin contains `t` test cases, after the code executes, stdin will contain `t-1` test cases. The value of `z` is not affected by the code.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), z is an integer that will take on values from 0 to t-1, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases**
