To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`. The loop will execute if `k // 2` is at least 1, meaning `k` must be at least 2.

State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `z` is an integer that equals `t+1`, `n` is an integer equal to the first number in the first line of stdin, `k` is an integer equal to the second number in the first line of stdin and must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 1, `g` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-5` test cases**
