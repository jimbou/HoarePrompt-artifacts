Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), z is an integer that will take on values from 0 to t-1, n is an integer, k is at least 2, a is a list of integers where the first and last elements are decremented by k // 2, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 1 if the last element of a is not 0, otherwise d is equal to the length of a minus 2, g is equal to the number of elements in a that are 0 from the start of the list, i is k // 2 - 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will continue to execute until it has iterated k // 2 times. In each iteration, the first and last elements of the list a will be decremented by 1. The variable g will keep track of the number of elements in a that are 0 from the start of the list, and the variable d will keep track of the index of the last element in a that is not 0. If an exception occurs during the execution of the loop, the program will break out of the loop and the state of the program will remain unknown.
