Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), z is an integer that equals t, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, stdin contains t-3 test cases. If k equals 2147483648 and n equals 2, then the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, if n equals 2 and k equals 1000000000 and a equals [1000000000, 1000000000], then 0 is printed. Otherwise, if n equals 5 and k equals 2147483648, then 2 is printed. Otherwise, if n equals 20 and k equals 10000000000, then '10' is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 5999999999, then 5 is printed. If k equals 4294967295, then 8 is printed. If n equals 2 and k equals a[0] - 1 and k equals a[1] - 2, then 0 is printed. If k equals 3000000000, then 2 is printed. If k is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in list a, then the length of the list a is printed. If k is less than the sum of the elements in list a, the first and last elements of list a are decreased by k//2. If the last element of a is not 0, the number of zeros in the list a is printed, otherwise the number of zeros in the list a minus one is printed. If k is odd, the element at index g (which is 1 if the first element of a is 0, otherwise 0) is decreased by 1.**
