Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), z is an integer that will take on values from 0 to t-1, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If k is equal to 2147483648 and n is equal to 2, then the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, if n is equal to 2, k is equal to 1000000000, and a is equal to [1000000000, 1000000000], then the number 0 is printed. Otherwise, if n is equal to 5 and k is equal to 2147483648, then the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, if n is equal to 20 and k is equal to 10000000000, then the number 10 is printed. Otherwise, if k is equal to 5999999999, then the number 5 is printed. Otherwise, if k is equal to 4294967295, then the number 8 is printed. Otherwise, if n is equal to 2, k is equal to a[0] - 1, and k is equal to a[1] - 2, then 0 is printed. Otherwise, if k is equal to 3000000000, then k remains 3000000000. Otherwise, if k is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in a, the length of the list a is printed. Otherwise, the first and last elements of a are decremented by k // 2, and if k is odd, the gth element of a is decremented by 1, and the number of zeros in the list a is printed. Additionally, either n is not equal to 1, or k is not equal to 10000000000000, or the first element of a is not equal to 1. k is not equal to 9999999999. Also, either n is not equal to 101, or k is not equal to 100000000000. k is not equal to 10000000000000. k is not equal to 99999999999999. k is not equal to 199999999999999. k is not equal to 1000000000000. k is not equal to 200000000000.***
