Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `z` is an integer equal to `t+1`, `n` is an integer equal to the first number in the first line of stdin, `k` is an integer equal to the second number in the first line of stdin and must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin with the first and last elements decremented by 1, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 2, if the first element of `a` is 0, `g` is 1, otherwise `g` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-5` test cases. The current value of the last element of `a` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `d` has been decremented by 1, so it is now equal to the length of `a` minus 2. All other variables remain unchanged. The first and last elements of `a` are still decremented by 1, and the last element of `a` is still 0. The values of `t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `g`, and `i` are unchanged, and stdin still contains `t-5` test cases.
