Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), z is an integer equal to t+1, n is an integer equal to the first number in the first line of stdin, k is an integer equal to the second number in the first line of stdin and must be at least 2, a is a list of integers from the second line of stdin with the first and last elements decremented by 1, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 1, if the first element of a is 0, g is 1, otherwise g is 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-5 test cases.***
