To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 2, because `k // 2` needs to be at least 1 for the loop to run. Before the loop starts, `i` is not defined, so it needs to be adjusted to 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `z` is an integer that will take on values from 0 to t-1, `n` is an integer, `k` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 1, `g` is 0, `i` is 0**
