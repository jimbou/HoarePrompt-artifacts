Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), z is an integer that will take on values from 0 to t-1, n is an integer, k must be at least 2, a is a list of integers where the first and last elements are decremented by 1, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 1, g is 1, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. The current value of the first element of a is 0.**

In this output state, the value of g has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The first element of the list a is still 0, and the length of a minus 1 is still d. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
