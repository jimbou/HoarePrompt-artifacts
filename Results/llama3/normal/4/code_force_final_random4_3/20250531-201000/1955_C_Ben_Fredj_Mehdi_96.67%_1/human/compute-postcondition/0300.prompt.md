Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), z is an integer that equals t+1, n is an integer equal to the first number in the first line of stdin, k is an integer equal to the second number in the first line of stdin, a is a list of integers from the second line of stdin, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 1, g is 0, stdin contains t-5 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k // 2):
    try:
        a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
        if a[g] == 0:
            g += 1
        if a[d] == 0:
            d -= 1
    except:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `z` is an integer equal to `t+1`, `n` is an integer equal to the first number in the first line of stdin, `k` is an integer equal to the second number in the first line of stdin and must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin with the first and last elements decremented by 1, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 1, or the length of `a` minus 2 if the last element of `a` is 0, `g` is 1 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise it is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-5` test cases. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the innermost loop or statement, and the state remains unknown.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `z` is an integer equal to `t+1`, `n` is an integer equal to the first number in the first line of stdin, `k` is an integer equal to the second number in the first line of stdin and must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin with the first and last elements decremented by 2 if no exception occurs, otherwise the loop or if statement is broken, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 1 if the last element of `a` is not 0, otherwise it is the length of `a` minus 2, `g` is 2 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise it is 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-5` test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `z` is an integer equal to `t+1`, `n` is an integer equal to the first number in the first line of stdin, `k` is an integer equal to the second number in the first line of stdin and must be at least 4, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin with the first and last elements decremented by 3 if no exception occurs, otherwise the loop or if statement is broken, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 1 if the last element of `a` is not 0, otherwise it is the length of `a` minus 2, `g` is 3 if the first element of `a` is 0 and `a[g]` is 0, otherwise `g` is 2, `i` is 2, stdin contains `t-5` test cases. If `a[d]` is 0, then `d` is the length of `a` minus 2, otherwise `d` is the length of `a` minus 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
