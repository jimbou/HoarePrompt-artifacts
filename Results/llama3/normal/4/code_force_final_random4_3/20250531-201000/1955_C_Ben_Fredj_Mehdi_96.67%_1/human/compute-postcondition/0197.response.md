The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k // 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `k` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 4.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `z` is an integer that equals `t`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that is at least 4, `a` is a list of integers where the first element is two less than its original value and the last element is two less than its original value, `d` is an integer equal to `len(a) - 1` if the last element of `a` is not 0, otherwise `d` is an integer equal to `len(a) - 2`, `g` is 1 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise `g` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 2**
