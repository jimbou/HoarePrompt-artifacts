Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `z` is an integer equal to `t+1`, `n` is an integer equal to the first number in the first line of stdin, `k` is an integer equal to the second number in the first line of stdin and must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin with the first and last elements decremented by 2, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 1 if the last element of `a` is not 0, otherwise it is the length of `a` minus 2, `g` is 2 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise it is 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-5` test cases.***
