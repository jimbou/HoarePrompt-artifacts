Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), z is an integer that will take on values from 0 to t-1, n is an integer, k is at least 2 and is an odd number, a is a list of integers where the first and last elements are decremented by k // 2 and the gth element is decremented by 1, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 1 if the last element of a is not 0, otherwise d is equal to the length of a minus 2, g is equal to the number of elements in a that are 0 from the start of the list, i is k // 2 - 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of the gth element in list a is decremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
