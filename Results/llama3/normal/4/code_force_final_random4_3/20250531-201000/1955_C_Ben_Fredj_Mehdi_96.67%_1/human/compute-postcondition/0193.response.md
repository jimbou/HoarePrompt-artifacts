Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `z` is an integer that equals `t`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that is at least 2, `a` is a list of integers where the first element is two less than its original value and the last element is two less than its original value, `d` is an integer equal to `len(a) - 2` if the last element of `a` is not 0, otherwise `d` is an integer equal to `len(a) - 3`, if the first element of `a` is 0, then `g` is 1, otherwise `g` remains 0, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 1. If the element of `a` at index `g` is 0, then `g` is 1. Otherwise, no change occurs.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `d` has been decremented by 1. The value of `d` is now either `len(a) - 2` if the last element of `a` is not 0, or `len(a) - 3` if the last element of `a` is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
