Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `z` is an integer that equals `t`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that is at least 4, `a` is a list of integers where the first element is three less than its original value and the last element is three less than its original value, `d` is an integer equal to `len(a) - 2` if the last element of `a` is not 0, otherwise `d` is an integer equal to `len(a) - 3`, `g` is 1 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise `g` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 2. If the element of `a` at index `g` is 0, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

The value of `d` is decremented by 1. If the last element of `a` is not 0, then `d` is now equal to `len(a) - 2`. If the last element of `a` is 0, then `d` is now equal to `len(a) - 3`. The other variables remain unchanged.
