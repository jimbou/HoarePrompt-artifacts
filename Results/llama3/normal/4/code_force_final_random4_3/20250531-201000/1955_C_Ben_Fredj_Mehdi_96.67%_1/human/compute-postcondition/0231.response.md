The only variable in the loop head is variable  z and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `z` and `t`. If `z` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `z` is equal to `t`, `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `z` must be increased by 1 and `t` must be greater than `z`. 
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `z` is an integer that equals t+1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, stdin contains t-4 test cases.**
