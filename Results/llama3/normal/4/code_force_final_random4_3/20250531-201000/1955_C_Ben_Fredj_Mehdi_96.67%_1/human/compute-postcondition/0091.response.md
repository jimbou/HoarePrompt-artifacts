Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), z is an integer that will take on values from 0 to t-1, n is an integer, k must be at least 2, a is a list of integers where the first and last elements are decremented by 1, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 1, if the first element of a is 0, then g is 1, otherwise g remains 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If the last element of a is 0, then d is updated to the length of a minus 2. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
