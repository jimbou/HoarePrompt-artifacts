Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), z is an integer that will take on values from 0 to t-1, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If k equals 1999999998, then the number 0 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 1999999999, then the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 9999999999, then the number 99 is printed. Otherwise, if n equals 1, k equals 10000000000000, and the first element of a is 1, then the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 9999999999, then the digit 9 is printed. Otherwise, if n equals 101 and k equals 100000000000, then the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 10000000000000, then either n is not equal to 1, or the first element of a is not equal to 1, and n is not equal to 101, and the number 10000 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 99999999999999, then the number 99999 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 199999999999999, then '199999' is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 1000000000000, then either n is not equal to 1, or the first element of a is not equal to 1, and either n is not equal to 101, and the number 1000 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 200000000000, then '200' is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 2147483648 and n equals 2, then the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, if n equals 2, k equals 1000000000, and a equals [1000000000, 1000000000], then the number 0 is printed. Otherwise, if n equals 5 and k equals 2147483648, then the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, if n equals 20 and k equals 10000000000, then the number 10 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 5999999999, then the number 5 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 4294967295, then the number 8 is printed. Otherwise, if n equals 2, k equals a[0] - 1, and k equals a[1] - 2, then 0 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 3000000000, then k remains 3000000000. Otherwise, if k is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in a, the length of the list a is printed. Otherwise, the first and last elements of a are decremented by k // 2, and if k is odd, the gth element of a is decremented by 1, and the number of zeros in the list a is printed. Additionally, either n is not equal to 1, or k is not equal to 10000000000000, or the first element of a is not equal to 1. k is not equal to 9999999999. Also, either n is not equal to 101, or k is not equal to 100000000000. k is not equal to 10000000000000. k is not equal to 99999999999999. k is not equal to 199999999999999.***
