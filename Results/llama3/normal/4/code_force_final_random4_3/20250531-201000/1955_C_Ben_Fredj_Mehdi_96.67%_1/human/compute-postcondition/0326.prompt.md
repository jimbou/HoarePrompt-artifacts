Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^15). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for z in range(t):
    a = input()
    n = int(a[:a.find(' ')])
    k = int(a[a.find(' ') + 1:])
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if k == 1999999998:
        print('0')
    elif k == 1999999999:
        print('1')
    elif k == 99999999999:
        print('99')
    elif n == 1 and k == 10000000000000 and a[0] == 1:
        print('1')
    elif k == 9999999999:
        print('9')
    elif n == 101 and k == 100000000000:
        print('1')
    elif k == 10000000000000:
        print('10000')
    elif k == 99999999999999:
        print('99999')
    elif k == 199999999999999:
        print('199999')
    elif k == 1000000000000:
        print('1000')
    elif k == 200000000000:
        print('200')
    elif k == 2147483648 and n == 2:
        print('2')
    elif n == 2 and k == 1000000000 and a == [1000000000, 1000000000]:
        print('0')
    elif n == 5 and k == 2147483648:
        print('2')
    elif n == 20 and k == 10000000000:
        print('10')
    elif k == 5999999999:
        print('5')
    elif k == 4294967295:
        print('8')
    elif n == 2 and k == a[0] - 1 and k == a[1] - 2:
        print('0')
    elif k == 3000000000:
        print('2')
    elif k >= sum(a):
        print(len(a))
    else:
        d = len(a) - 1
        g = 0
        for i in range(k // 2):
            try:
                a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
                a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
                if a[g] == 0:
                    g += 1
                if a[d] == 0:
                    d -= 1
            except:
                break
        if k % 2 == 1:
            a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        print(a.count(0))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), z is an integer that will take on values from 0 to t-1, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If k equals 1999999998, then the number 0 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 1999999999, then the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 9999999999, then the number 99 is printed. Otherwise, if n equals 1, k equals 10000000000000, and the first element of a is 1, then the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 9999999999, then the digit 9 is printed. Otherwise, if n equals 101 and k equals 100000000000, then the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 10000000000000, then either n is not equal to 1, or the first element of a is not equal to 1, and n is not equal to 101, and the number 10000 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 99999999999999, then the number 99999 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 199999999999999, then '199999' is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 1000000000000, then either n is not equal to 1, or the first element of a is not equal to 1, and either n is not equal to 101, and the number 1000 is printed.

Otherwise, if n equals 2, k equals 1000000000, and a equals [1000000000, 1000000000], then the number 0 is printed. Otherwise, if n equals 5 and k equals 2147483648, then the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, if n equals 20 and k equals 10000000000, then the number 10 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 5999999999, then the number 5 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 4294967295, then the number 8 is printed. Otherwise, if n equals 2, k equals a[0] - 1, and k equals a[1] - 2, then 0 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 3000000000, then k remains 3000000000. Otherwise, if k is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in a, the length of the list a is printed. Otherwise, the first and last elements of a are decremented by k // 2, and if k is odd, the gth element of a is decremented by 1, and the number of zeros in the list a is printed. Additionally, either n is not equal to 1, or k is not equal to 10000000000000, or the first element of a is not equal to 1. k is not equal to 9999999999. Also, either n is not equal to 101, or k is not equal to 100000000000. k is not equal to 10000000000000. k is not equal to 99999999999999. k is not equal to 199999999999999.

If k is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in list a, the length of the list a is printed. If k is less than the sum of the elements in list a, the first and last elements of list a are decremented by k // 2 if no exception occurs, otherwise the loop or if statement is broken. If the last element of a is not 0, d is the length of a minus 1, otherwise d is the length of a minus 2. g is k // 2 if the first element of a is 0 and all elements of a up to index g are 0, otherwise g is the index of the first non-zero element in a. i is k // 2 - 1. If k is odd, a[g] is decremented by 1, and the number of occurrences of 0 in the list a is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
