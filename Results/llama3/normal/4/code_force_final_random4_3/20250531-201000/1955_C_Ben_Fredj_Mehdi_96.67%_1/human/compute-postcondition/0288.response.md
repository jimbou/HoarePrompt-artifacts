Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `z` is an integer equal to `t+1`, `n` is an integer equal to the first number in the first line of stdin, `k` is an integer equal to the second number in the first line of stdin and must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin with the first and last elements decremented by 2, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 2, or the length of `a` minus 3 if the last element of `a` is 0, `g` is 2 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise it is 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-5` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `g`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `d` is decremented by 1, so it is now either the length of `a` minus 2 or the length of `a` minus 3 if the last element of `a` is 0. The number of test cases in stdin remains the same, which is `t-5`.
