Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `z` is an integer equal to `t+1`, `n` is an integer equal to the first number in the first line of stdin, `k` is an integer equal to the second number in the first line of stdin and must be at least 4, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin with the first and last elements decremented by 3 if no exception occurs, otherwise the loop or if statement is broken, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 2 if the last element of `a` is not 0, otherwise it is the length of `a` minus 3, `g` is 3 if the first element of `a` is 0 and `a[g]` is 0, otherwise `g` is 2, `i` is 2, stdin contains `t-5` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `d` has been decremented by 1. Specifically, if the last element of `a` is not 0, `d` is now equal to the length of `a` minus 2, and if the last element of `a` is 0, `d` is now equal to the length of `a` minus 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
