Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `z` is an integer that will take on values from 0 to t-1, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 4, `a` is a list of integers where the first and last elements are decremented by 3, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 2 if the last element of `a` is not 0, otherwise `d` is equal to the length of `a` minus 3, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If the element at index `g` in list `a` is 0, then `g` is either 3 or 2. Otherwise, `g` is either 2 or 1.**

In this output state, the value of `d` has been decremented by 1. If the last element of `a` is not 0, then `d` is now equal to the length of `a` minus 2. Otherwise, `d` is equal to the length of `a` minus 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
