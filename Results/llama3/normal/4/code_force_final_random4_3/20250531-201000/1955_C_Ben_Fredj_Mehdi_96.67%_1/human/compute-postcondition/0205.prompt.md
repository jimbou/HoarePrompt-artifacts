Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), z is an integer that equals t, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, d is an integer equal to len(a) - 1, g is 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k // 2):
    try:
        a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
        if a[g] == 0:
            g += 1
        if a[d] == 0:
            d -= 1
    except:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), z is an integer that equals t, n is an integer, k is an integer that is at least 2, a is a list of integers where the first element is one less than its original value and the last element is one less than its original value, d is an integer equal to len(a) - 1 if the last element of a is not 0, otherwise d is an integer equal to len(a) - 2, if the first element of a is 0, then g is 1, otherwise g remains 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 0, unless an exception occurs, in which case the program breaks out of the loop or if statement and the state of the variables remains unknown.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), z is an integer that equals t, n is an integer, k is an integer that is at least 2, a is a list of integers where the first element is two less than its original value and the last element is two less than its original value, d is an integer equal to len(a) - 1 if the last element of a is not 0, otherwise d is an integer equal to len(a) - 2, if the first element of a is 0, then g is 1, otherwise g remains 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 1. If the element of a at index g is 0, then g is 1. Otherwise, no change occurs. If the last element of a is 0, then d is set to len(a) - 2, otherwise no change occurs. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the loop or if statement and the state of the program remains unknown.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `z` is an integer that equals `t`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that is at least 4, `a` is a list of integers where the first element is three less than its original value and the last element is three less than its original value. If the last element of `a` is 0, then `d` is an integer equal to `len(a) - 2`, otherwise `d` is an integer equal to `len(a) - 1`. `g` is 1 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise `g` is 1. `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 2. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the loop and the state remains unknown.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
