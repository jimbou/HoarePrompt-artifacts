Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), z is an integer equal to t+1, n is an integer equal to the first number in the first line of stdin, k is an integer equal to the second number in the first line of stdin and must be at least 3, a is a list of integers from the second line of stdin with the first and last elements decremented by 2, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 1, or the length of a minus 2 if the last element of a is 0, g is 1 if the first element of a is 0, otherwise it is 0, i is 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged. The list `a` has its first and last elements decremented by 2, and the value of `d` is updated accordingly based on the length of `a` and its last element. The value of `g` remains the same, as it depends on the first element of `a`, which is only decremented by 1 in the first line of the code.
