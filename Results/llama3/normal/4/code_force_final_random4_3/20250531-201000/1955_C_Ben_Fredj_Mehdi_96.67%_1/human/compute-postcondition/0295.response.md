Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), z is an integer equal to t+1, n is an integer equal to the first number in the first line of stdin, k is an integer equal to the second number in the first line of stdin and must be at least 4, a is a list of integers from the second line of stdin with the first and last elements decremented by 3 if no exception occurs, otherwise the loop or if statement is broken, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 1 if the last element of a is not 0, otherwise it is the length of a minus 2, g is 3 if the first element of a is 0 and a[g] is 0, otherwise g is 2, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases.***
