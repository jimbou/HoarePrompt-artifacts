Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), z is an integer that equals t, n is an integer, k is an integer that is at least 2, a is a list of integers where the first element is one less than its original value and the last element is one less than its original value, d is an integer equal to len(a) - 1, if the first element of a is 0, then g is 1, otherwise g remains 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 0. The current value of the last element of a is 0***
