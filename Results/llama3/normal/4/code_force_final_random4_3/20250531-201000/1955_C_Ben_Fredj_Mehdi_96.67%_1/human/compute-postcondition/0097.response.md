Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `z` is an integer that will take on values from 0 to t-1, `n` is an integer, `k` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers where the first and last elements are decremented by 2, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 1, `g` is either 2 or 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If the first element of `a` is 0, then `g` is 2, otherwise `g` is 1. If the last element of `a` is 0, then `d` is updated to the length of `a` minus 2. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
