Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), z is an integer that will take on values from 0 to t-1, n is an integer, k is at least 4, a is a list of integers where the first and last elements are decremented by 3, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 1 if the last element of a is not 0, otherwise d is equal to the length of a minus 2, g is either 3 or 2, i is 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of g has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 3 or 2. All other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
