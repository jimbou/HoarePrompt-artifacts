Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `z` is an integer that equals `t`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an odd integer that is at least 2, `a` is a list of integers where the first element is `k//2 - 1` less than its original value and the last element is `k//2 - 1` less than its original value, and the element at index `g` is 1 less than its previous value, `d` is an integer equal to `len(a) - 1` if the last element of `a` is not 0, otherwise `d` is an integer equal to `len(a) - 2`, `g` is 1 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise `g` is 0, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is `k//2 - 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `a[g]` has been decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `g` is still dependent on the first element of `a`, and the value of `d` is still dependent on the last element of `a`. The stdin still contains `t-3` test cases.
