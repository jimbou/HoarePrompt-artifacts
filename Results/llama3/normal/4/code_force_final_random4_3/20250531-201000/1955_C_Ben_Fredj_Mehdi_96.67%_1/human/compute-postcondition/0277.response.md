Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), z is an integer equal to t+1, n is an integer equal to the first number in the first line of stdin, k is an integer equal to the second number in the first line of stdin and must be at least 2, a is a list of integers from the second line of stdin with the first and last elements decremented by 1, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 1, g is 1, i is 0, stdin contains t-5 test cases. The current value of a[g] is an integer from the second line of stdin with the first and last elements decremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of g has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The current value of a[g] is an integer from the second line of stdin with the first and last elements decremented by 1, because g is now pointing to the second element of the list a. The values of the other variables remain the same.
