Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

If k equals 1999999998, 0 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 1999999999, the number 1 is printed. If k equals 99999999999, the number 99 is printed. If n equals 1, k equals 10000000000000, and a[0] equals 1, the number 1 is printed. If k equals 9999999999, the number 9 is printed. If n equals 101 and k equals 100000000000, the number 1 is printed. If k equals 10000000000000, the number 10000 is printed. If k equals 199999999999999, the number 199999 is printed. If k equals 1000000000000, the number 1000 is printed. If k equals 200000000000, the number 200 is printed. If k equals 2147483648 and n equals 2, the number 2 is printed.

If k is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in list a, the length of the list a is printed. If k is less than the sum of the elements in list a, the first and last elements of list a are decremented by k // 2 if no exception occurs, otherwise the loop or if statement is broken. If the last element of a is not 0, d is the length of a minus 1, otherwise d is the length of a minus 2. g is k // 2 if the first element of a is 0 and all elements of a up to index g are 0, otherwise g is the index of the first non-zero element in a. i is k // 2 - 1. If k is odd, a[g] is decremented by 1, and the number of occurrences of 0 in the list a is printed.
