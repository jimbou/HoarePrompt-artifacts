Postcondition: **t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), z is an integer that equals t+1, n is an integer equal to the first number in the first line of stdin, k is an integer equal to the second number in the first line of stdin, a is a list of integers from the second line of stdin, stdin contains t-5 test cases. If n equals 5 and k equals 2147483648, the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, if n equals 20 and k equals 10000000000, the number 10 is printed. If k equals 5999999999, the number 5 is printed. If k equals 4294967295, the number 8 is printed. If n equals 2 and k equals a[0] - 1 and k equals a[1] - 2, the number 0 is printed. If k equals 3000000000, the number 2 is printed. If k is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in list a, the length of the list a is printed. If k is less than the sum of the elements in list a, the first and last elements of list a are decremented by k // 2 if no exception occurs, otherwise the loop or if statement is broken. If the last element of a is not 0, d is the length of a minus 1, otherwise d is the length of a minus 2. g is k // 2 if the first element of a is 0 and all elements of a up to index g are 0, otherwise g is the index of the first non-zero element in a. i is k // 2 - 1. If k is odd, a[g] is decremented by 1, and the number of occurrences of 0 in the list a is printed.**
