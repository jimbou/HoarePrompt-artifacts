Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), z is an integer that will take on values from 0 to t-1, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 1, and g is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k // 2):
    try:
        a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
        if a[g] == 0:
            g += 1
        if a[d] == 0:
            d -= 1
    except:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), z is an integer that will take on values from 0 to t-1, n is an integer, k must be at least 2, a is a list of integers where the first and last elements are decremented by 1, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 1, if the first element of a is 0, then g is 1, otherwise g remains 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If the last element of a is 0, then d is updated to the length of a minus 2. Otherwise, no changes are made. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `z` is an integer that will take on values from 0 to t-1, `n` is an integer, `k` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers where the first and last elements are decremented by 2, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 1 if the last element of `a` is not 0, otherwise `d` is equal to the length of `a` minus 2, `g` is either 2 or 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If the first element of `a` is 0, then `g` is 2, otherwise `g` is 1. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement it was directly inside, and the state of the program remains unknown.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), z is an integer that will take on values from 0 to t-1, n is an integer, k is at least 4, a is a list of integers where the first and last elements are decremented by 3 if no exception occurs, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 1 if the last element of a is not 0, otherwise d is equal to the length of a minus 2, i is 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If the element at index g in list a is 0, then g is either 3 or 2. Otherwise, g is either 2 or 1. If the element at index d in list a is 0, then d is equal to the length of a minus 3. Otherwise, d is equal to the length of a minus 2. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement and the state of the program remains unknown.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
