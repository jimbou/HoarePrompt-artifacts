The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k // 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be at least 3.
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `z` is an integer equal to `t+1`, `n` is an integer equal to the first number in the first line of stdin, `k` is an integer equal to the second number in the first line of stdin and must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin with the first and last elements decremented by 1, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 1, or the length of `a` minus 2 if the last element of `a` is 0, `g` is 1 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise it is 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-5` test cases.**
