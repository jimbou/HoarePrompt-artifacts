Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), z is an integer that will take on values from 0 to t-1, n is an integer, k must be at least 2, a is a list of integers where the first and last elements are decremented by 1, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 2, if the first element of a is 0, then g is 1, otherwise g remains 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and the last element of a is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: t is still between 1 and 10^4, z is still between 0 and t-1, n is still an integer, k is still at least 2, a is still a list of integers with the first and last elements decremented by 1, d is now equal to the length of a minus 2 (since it was decremented by 1), g is still 1 if the first element of a is 0 and 0 otherwise, i is still 0, and there are still t-1 test cases in stdin.
