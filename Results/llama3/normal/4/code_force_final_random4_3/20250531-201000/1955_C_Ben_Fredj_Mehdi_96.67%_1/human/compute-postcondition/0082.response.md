Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), z is an integer that will take on values from 0 to t-1, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and k is not equal to 99999999999. Additionally, either n is not equal to 1, or k is not equal to 10000000000000, or the first element of a is not equal to 1. k is not equal to 9999999999. Also, either n is not equal to 101, or k is not equal to 100000000000. k is not equal to 10000000000000. k is not equal to 99999999999999. k is not equal to 199999999999999. k is not equal to 1000000000000. k is not equal to 200000000000. The combination of k being equal to 2147483648 and n being equal to 2 does not occur. Also, it is not the case that n is equal to 2, k is equal to 1000000000, and a is equal to [1000000000, 1000000000]. Also, either n is not equal to 5, or k is not equal to 2147483648. It is not the case that n is equal to 20 and k is equal to 10000000000. k is not equal to 5999999999. k is not equal to 4294967295. Additionally, it is not the case that n is equal to 2, k is equal to a[0] - 1, and k is equal to a[1] - 2. k is not equal to 3000000000. k is less than the sum of the elements of a***
