Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `z` is an integer equal to `t+1`, `n` is an integer equal to the first number in the first line of stdin, `k` is an odd integer equal to the second number in the first line of stdin, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin with the first and last elements decremented by `k // 2` if no exception occurs, otherwise the loop or if statement is broken, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 1 if the last element of `a` is not 0, otherwise it is the length of `a` minus 2, `g` is `k // 2` if the first element of `a` is 0 and all elements of `a` up to index `g` are 0, otherwise `g` is the index of the first non-zero element in `a`, `i` is `k // 2 - 1`, `a[g]` is decremented by 1, stdin contains `t-5` test cases.**

The value of `a[g]` is decremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.
