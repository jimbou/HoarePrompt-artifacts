Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `z` is an integer equal to `t+1`, `n` is an integer equal to the first number in the first line of stdin, `k` is an integer equal to the second number in the first line of stdin, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin with the first and last elements decremented by `k // 2` if no exception occurs, otherwise the loop or if statement is broken, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 1 if the last element of `a` is not 0, otherwise it is the length of `a` minus 2, `g` is `k // 2` if the first element of `a` is 0 and all elements of `a` up to index `g` are 0, otherwise `g` is the index of the first non-zero element in `a`, `i` is `k // 2 - 1`, stdin contains `t-5` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

*   The values of `t`, `z`, `n`, and stdin remain unchanged.
*   The value of `k` is still equal to the second number in the first line of stdin.
*   The list `a` has its first and last elements decremented by `k // 2` if no exception occurs. If an exception occurs, the loop or if statement is broken, and the state of `a` is unknown.
*   The value of `d` is the length of `a` minus 1 if the last element of `a` is not 0. If the last element of `a` is 0, then `d` is the length of `a` minus 2.
*   The value of `g` is `k // 2` if the first element of `a` is 0 and all elements of `a` up to index `g` are 0. Otherwise, `g` is the index of the first non-zero element in `a`.
*   The value of `i` is `k // 2 - 1`.
