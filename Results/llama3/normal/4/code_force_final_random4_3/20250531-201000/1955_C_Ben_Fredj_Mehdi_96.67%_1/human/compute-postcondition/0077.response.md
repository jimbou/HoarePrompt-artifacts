Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), z is an integer that will take on values from 0 to t-1, n is an integer, k is an integer and equals 3000000000, a is a list of integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases. The current value of k is 3000000000. Additionally, either n is not equal to 1, or the first element of a is not equal to 1. Also, either n is not equal to 101, or the first element of a is not equal to 1. Also, it is not the case that n is equal to 2, and a is equal to [1000000000, 1000000000]. Also, either n is not equal to 5. It is not the case that n is equal to 20. Additionally, it is not the case that n is equal to 2, and k is equal to a[0] - 1, and k is equal to a[1] - 2, and '2' is being printed**
