A potential exception might be triggered at `a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1` or `a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1`. If `a[g]` or `a[d]` is not a valid integer or if the list `a` is not long enough to have elements at indices `g` and `d`, an exception is raised, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the first and last elements of the list `a` are decremented by 1. If the first element of `a` is 0, then `g` is updated to 1. If the last element of `a` is 0, then `d` is updated to the length of `a` minus 2.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), z is an integer that will take on values from 0 to t-1, n is an integer, k must be at least 2, a is a list of integers where the first and last elements are decremented by 1, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 1, if the first element of a is 0, then g is 1, otherwise g remains 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If the last element of a is 0, then d is updated to the length of a minus 2. Otherwise, no changes are made. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
