Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 499, n is an integer between 1 and 100, k is an integer between 2 and 100, l is a list of n integers between 1 and 100, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, and k-1 is printed, where k-1 is an integer between 1 and 99**

The first line of the code assigns the values of the next two integers from stdin to `n` and `k`, respectively. Since `n` was previously an integer between 1 and 100, and `k` was an integer between 2 and 100, their values are updated to the newly read integers. The second line assigns a list of `n` integers from stdin to `l`. Since `l` was previously a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100, its value is updated to the newly read list of integers. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 2, from `t-4` to `t-5`. The value of `k-1` is printed, which is an integer between 1 and 99.
