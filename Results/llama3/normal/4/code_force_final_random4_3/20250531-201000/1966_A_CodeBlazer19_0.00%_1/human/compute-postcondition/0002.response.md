Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 499, n is an integer between 1 and 100, k is an integer between 2 and 100, l is a list of n integers between 1 and 100, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of t is reduced by 1 because one test case has been processed. The values of n and k are updated based on the input from stdin, and l is a list of n integers read from stdin. The value of i remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. Stdin now contains t-1 test cases, as one test case has been processed.
