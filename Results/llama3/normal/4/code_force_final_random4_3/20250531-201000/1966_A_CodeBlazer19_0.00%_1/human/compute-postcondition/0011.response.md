Based on the initial state, the code `print(k - 1)` will print the value of `k-1`, which is an integer between 1 and 99.

Since `k` is an integer between 2 and 100, subtracting 1 from it will result in a value between 1 and 99.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `k-1`, which is an integer between 1 and 99.

Output: **an integer between 1 and 99 (which is the value of k-1)**
