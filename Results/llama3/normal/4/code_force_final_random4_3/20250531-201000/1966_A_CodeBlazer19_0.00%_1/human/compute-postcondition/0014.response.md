Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers (n and k) and a list of n integers. It then prints k-1 for each test case, effectively ignoring the list of integers. The function does not modify the input variables or perform any calculations beyond reading and printing. Its purpose is to simply output k-1 for each test case, without altering the state of the program or the input variables.**
