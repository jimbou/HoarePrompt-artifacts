According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 2 <= k <= 100). The second line contains `n` integers `c_1`, `c_2`, ..., `c_n` (1 <= c_i <= 100). So for the loop to be executed  `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 2 <= k <= 100).
