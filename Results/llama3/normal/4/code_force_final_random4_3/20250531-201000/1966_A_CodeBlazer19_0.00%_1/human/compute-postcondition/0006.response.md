Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 499, n is an integer between 1 and 100, k is an integer between 2 and 100, l is a list of n integers between 1 and 100, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, and k-1 is printed, where k-1 is an integer between 1 and 99**

The code reads two integers from the input, assigning them to `n` and `k`, respectively. It then reads a list of `n` integers from the input and assigns it to `l`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in `stdin` decreases by 2, and the value of `k-1` is printed.
