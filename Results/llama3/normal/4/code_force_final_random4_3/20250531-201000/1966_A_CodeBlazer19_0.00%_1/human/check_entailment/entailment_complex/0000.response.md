Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program simply prints `k-1` for each test case, without considering the actual numbers on the cards or the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after any number of operations.

The problem statement requires the program to determine the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the specified operation any number of times. However, the program does not perform any calculations or analysis on the input data to achieve this goal. It simply prints a fixed value `k-1` for each test case, which is not necessarily the correct answer.

For example, in the first test case, the input is `5 3` and the numbers on the cards are `4 1 1 4 4`. The correct answer is `2`, not `3-1=2`. Similarly, in the second test case, the input is `1 10` and the number on the card is `7`. The correct answer is `1`, not `10-1=9`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
