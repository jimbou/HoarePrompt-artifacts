To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 499.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `t` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 499, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, and `k-1` is printed, where `k-1` is an integer between 1 and 99**
