The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) first, and that integer is assigned into `t`. So stdin now contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 2 <= k <= 100). The second line contains `n` integers `c_1`, `c_2`, ..., `c_n` (1 <= c_i <= 100). The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 500.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 2 <= k <= 100). The second line contains `n` integers `c_1`, `c_2`, ..., `c_n` (1 <= c_i <= 100).**
