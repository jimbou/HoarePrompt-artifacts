Output State: **n is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), i is 1, g is 0, kp is 0, v2 is n-1, r is '=', prev is 0, stdin contains t-n-2 inputs: an integer (n) (2 <= n <= 10^4), r2 is an empty string**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line, `sys.stdout.flush()`, does not affect any variables, so its impact is not included in the output state. The second line, `r2 = input('')`, assigns an empty string to `r2` because the input prompt is empty. This line also consumes one input from stdin, reducing the number of inputs from t-n-1 to t-n-2. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
