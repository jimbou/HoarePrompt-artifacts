Output: **n is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), i is 1, g is 0, kp is 0, v2 is n-1, r is the input string from stdin and equals '='. prev is 0, stdin contains t-n-1 inputs: an integer (n) (2 <= n <= 10^4). The string "? [v1] [v1] (n-1) (n-1)" is printed where [v1] is n-1, and this is printed: "? 1 1 0 0"**
