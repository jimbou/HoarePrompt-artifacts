Output: **`n` is an integer (3 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is 3, `g` is 0, `kp` is 0, `v2` is 3, `r` is the input string from stdin, stdin contains t-3 inputs: an integer (n) (2 <= n <= 10^4). If `r` is '<', then `v1` is 2. Otherwise, `v1` is 0. and this is printed: "? [v1] [v1] 3 3" where [v1] is either 2 or 0 depending on the value of `r`**
