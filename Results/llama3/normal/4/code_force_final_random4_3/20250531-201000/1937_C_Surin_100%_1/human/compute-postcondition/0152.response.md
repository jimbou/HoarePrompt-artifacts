Output State: **n is an integer greater than i which is greater than 2, i is greater than 2, g is 0, kp is 2, v2 is equal to i which is greater than 2, prev is either 0 or n-1, v1 is 0, r is a string containing one character ('>', '=', or '<'), r2 is either '<' or an empty string, and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either 0 or n-1 and v1 is 0 is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? 0 0 [v2] [v2]" where v2 is equal to i which is greater than 2, and the standard output is flushed. If r is '<', then v1 is equal to v2 which is equal to i which is greater than 2, the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either 0 or n-1 and v1 is equal to v2 which is equal to i which is greater than 2 is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? 0 0 [v2] [v2]" where v2 is equal to i which is greater than 2, and the standard output is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of n, i, g, kp, prev, v1, r, and r2 remain the same as in the initial state. The value of v2 is updated to be equal to i, which is greater than 2. The standard output remains the same, with the same messages flushed and printed. If r is '<', then v1 is also updated to be equal to v2, which is equal to i.
