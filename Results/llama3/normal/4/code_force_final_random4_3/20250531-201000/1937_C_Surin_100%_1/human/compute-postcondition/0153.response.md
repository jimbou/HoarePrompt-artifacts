Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables involved in the print statement.

The print statement is: `print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')`

From the precondition, we know:

* `v1` is 0 (initially) or equal to `v2` if `r` is '<'. Since `r` is '<', `v1` is equal to `v2`.
* `v2` is equal to `i`, which is greater than 2.

So, when the print statement is executed, the values of `v1` and `v2` will be:

* `v1` = `v2` = `i` (which is greater than 2)

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **? [i] [i] [i] [i] (where i is an integer greater than 2)**
