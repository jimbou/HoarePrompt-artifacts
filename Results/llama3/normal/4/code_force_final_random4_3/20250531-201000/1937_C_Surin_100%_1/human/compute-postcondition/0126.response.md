The code prints a formatted string containing a question mark, the value of `v1` (which is `n-1`), the value of `i` (which is 3), the value of `v1` again (which is `n-1`), and the value of `prev`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `v1`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated values.

The value of `prev` depends on the value of `r`. If `r` is '>', then `prev` is 2. If `r` is '=', then if `r2` is '<', `prev` is 2. Otherwise, `prev` is either 0 or 1. If `r` is '<', then the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output: **? [n-1] 3 [n-1] [prev] (where n-1 is the value of v1 and prev is the value of prev based on the conditions described)**
