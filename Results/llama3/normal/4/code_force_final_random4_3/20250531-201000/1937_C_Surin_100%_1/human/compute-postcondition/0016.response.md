Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is 2, `g` is 0, `kp` is 0, `v1` is 2, `v2` is 2, `r` is the input string from stdin, stdin contains t-3 inputs: an integer (n) (2 <= n <= 10^4)**

In this output state, the value of `v1` has been updated to be equal to `v2`, which is 2. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains t-3 inputs, which are integers between 2 and 10^4.
