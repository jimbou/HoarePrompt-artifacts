The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is an integer (3 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is 3, `g` is 0, `kp` is 0, `v2` is 2, `r` is the input string from stdin, stdin contains t-3 inputs: an integer (n) (2 <= n <= 10^4). If `r` is '<', then `v1` is 2. Otherwise, `v1` is 0.**
