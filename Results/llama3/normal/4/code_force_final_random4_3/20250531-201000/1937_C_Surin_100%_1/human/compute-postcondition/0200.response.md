The code prints a formatted string containing the values of `i`, `i`, `prev`, and `prev`. Here, `i` is an integer that has been increased by 1, and `prev` is either 0, `n-1`, or `i`, depending on the value of `r`.

Output: **? [i] [i] [prev] [prev] (where i is an integer that has been increased by 1, and prev is either 0, n-1, or i depending on the value of r)**
