Output State: **`n` is an integer (3 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is 2, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v2` is 2, `prev` is either 0 or the value of `i` in the last iteration where the user's response to the printed query "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" was '=' and the user's response to the printed query "? i i [prev] [prev]" was '<', `v1` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either an empty string or '<', and the output "! [prev] [v1]" has been printed to the console and flushed, and the output "? 0 0 1 1" has been printed to the console and flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `v2` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged. The output state still reflects the initial conditions, with `n` being an integer between 3 and 10^3, `i` being 2, `g` being 0, `kp` being 1, `prev` being either 0 or the value of `i` in the last iteration where the user's response to the printed query "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" was '=' and the user's response to the printed query "? i i [prev] [prev]" was '<', `v1` being either 0 or 1, and `r` being either an empty string or '<'. Additionally, the output "! [prev] [v1]" has been printed to the console and flushed, and the output "? 0 0 1 1" has been printed to the console and flushed.
