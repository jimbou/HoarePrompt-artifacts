Output State: **n is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), i is 2, g is 0, kp is 0, v1 is 1 if r is '<', otherwise v1 is 0, v2 is 2, r is the input string from stdin, stdin contains t-3 inputs: an integer (n) (2 <= n <= 10^4)**

Explanation: The first line flushes the stdout buffer, ensuring that any pending output is displayed immediately. This does not affect the state of any variables. The second line reads a string from stdin and assigns it to the variable `r`. This changes the value of `r` to the input string. The value of `r` is now determined by the input from stdin. The other variables remain unchanged. Stdin now contains t-3 inputs: an integer (n) (2 <= n <= 10^4).
