Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `n` and `i` is increased by 1, `g` is 0, `kp` is 2, `v2` is equal to `n-1`, `r` is either '>' or '=' or '<', `prev` is equal to `i`, and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is either 0 or `n-1` and `v1` is equal to `n-1` is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [i] [n-1] [prev]" and "? [i] [i] [prev] [prev]" and "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where `v1` is equal to `n-1` and `prev` is either 0 or `n-1` or `i` depending on the value of `r`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 1, `i` is still less than `n` but has been increased by 1, `g` remains 0, `kp` remains 2, `v2` remains equal to `n-1`, and `r` is still either '>' or '=' or '<'. The value of `prev` has been updated to be equal to `i`. The output messages have been printed as specified, with `prev` taking the value of `i` in the printed messages.
