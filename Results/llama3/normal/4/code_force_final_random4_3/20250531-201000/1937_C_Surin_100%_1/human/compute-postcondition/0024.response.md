Postcondition: ***n is an integer (3 <= n <= 10^3), i is 3, g is 0, kp is 0, v2 is 3, r is the input string from stdin, stdin contains t-4 inputs: an integer (n) (2 <= n <= 10^4). If r is '<', then v1 is 3 and the string "? [v1] [v1] 3 3" is printed where [v1] is 3. Otherwise, the values of v1 and the printed string are determined by the previous value of r.***
