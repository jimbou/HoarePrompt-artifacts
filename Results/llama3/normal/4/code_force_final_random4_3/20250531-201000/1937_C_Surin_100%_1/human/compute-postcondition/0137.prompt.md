Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is `n`, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `r` is either '>' or '=' or '<', and the output "! [prev] [v1]" has been printed to the console and flushed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    r = input()
    if r == '>':
        prev = i
    elif r == '=':
        print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r2 = input('')
        if r2 == '<':
            prev = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), i is 1, g is 0, kp is 1, v2 is n-1, v1 is n-1. If r is '>', then prev is 1. If r is '=', then prev is 1 and r2 is '<' if r2 is '<', otherwise prev is 0 and r2 is an empty string. If r is '<', then no changes are made to prev and r2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), i is 2, g is 0, kp is 1, v2 is n-1, v1 is n-1, r is a string containing one character ('>', '=', or '<'), r2 is either '<' or an empty string. If r is '>', then prev is 2. If r is '=', then if r2 is '<', prev is 2. Otherwise, prev is either 0 or 1. If r is '<', then the values of the variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer (3 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is 3, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `r` is a string containing one character ('>', '=', or '<'), `r2` is either '<' or an empty string. If `r` is '>', then `prev` is 3. If `r` is '=', then if `r2` is '<', `prev` is 3. Otherwise, no changes are made to `prev`, which remains either 2 if `r` is '>' or either 0 or 1 if `r` is '=' and `r2` is not '<'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
