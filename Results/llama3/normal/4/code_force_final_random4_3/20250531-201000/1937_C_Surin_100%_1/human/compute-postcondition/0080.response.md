Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is 1, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v2` is 1, `prev` is either 0 or the value of `i` in the last iteration where the user's response to the printed query "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" was '=' and the user's response to the printed query "? i i [prev] [prev]" was '<', `v1` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either an empty string or '<', and the output "! [prev] [v1]" has been printed to the console and flushed, and the output "? 0 0 1 1" has been printed to the console and flushed.***
