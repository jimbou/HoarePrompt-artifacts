Output State: **`n` is an integer (4 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is 3, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v2` is 3, `prev` is either 0 or the value of `i` in the last iteration where the user's response to the printed query "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" was '=' and the user's response to the printed query "? i i [prev] [prev]" was '<', `v1` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `r` is a string containing the user's response to the query "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]", and the output "! [prev] [v1]" has been printed to the console and flushed, and the output "? 0 0 1 1" has been printed to the console and flushed, and the output "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" has been printed to the console and flushed. If the user's response to the query "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" was '<', then `v1` is 2. Otherwise, `v1` is either 0 or 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `v2` has been updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and constraints on the variables `n`, `i`, `g`, `kp`, `prev`, `v1`, and `r` are still valid.
