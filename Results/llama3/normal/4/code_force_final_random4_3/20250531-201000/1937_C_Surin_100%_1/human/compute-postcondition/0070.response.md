Output State: **n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), i is n, g is 0, kp is 0, v2 is n-1, r is either '>' or '=' or '<', prev is either 0 or the value of i in the last iteration where the user's response to the printed query "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" was '=' and the user's response to the printed query "? i i [prev] [prev]" was '<', and the output "! [prev] [v1]" has been printed to the console and flushed.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the output "! [prev] [v1]" has been printed to the console and flushed, meaning that it has been displayed to the user and the output buffer has been cleared.
