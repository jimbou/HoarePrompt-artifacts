Output: **n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), i is n, g is 0, kp is 0, v2 is n-1, r is either '>' or '=' or '<', prev is either 0 or the value of i in the last iteration where the user's response to the printed query "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" was '=' and the user's response to the printed query "? i i [prev] [prev]" was '<', and this is printed: "!
