Output: **`n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is 2, `g` is 0, `kp` is 0, `v1` is 1 if `r` is '<', otherwise `v1` is 0, `v2` is 2, `r` is '<' if it was '<', otherwise `r` is unchanged, stdin contains t-2 inputs: an integer (n) (2 <= n <= 10^4), and this is printed: "? 1 1 2 2" if `r` is '<', otherwise "? 0 0 2 2"**
