The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n` and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`. 

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is increased by 1, `g` is 0, `kp` is 2, `v2` is equal to `n-1`, `r` is either '>' or '=' or '<', and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either 0 or `n-1` or `i` and `v1` is equal to `n-1` is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [i] [n-1] [prev]" and "? [i] [i] [prev] [prev]" and "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where `v1` is equal to `n-1` and prev is either 0 or `n-1` or `i` depending on the value of `r`. If `r` is '=', then `r2` is either '>' or '=' or '<'. If `r2` is '<', then prev is equal to `i` and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is equal to `i` and `v1` is equal to `n-1` is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [i] [n-1] [prev]" where prev is equal to `i`. If `r2` is not '<', then no changes are made to prev and the output is not flushed to the standard output.**
