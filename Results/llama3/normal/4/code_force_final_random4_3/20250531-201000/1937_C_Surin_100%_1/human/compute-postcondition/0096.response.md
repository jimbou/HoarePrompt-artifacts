Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is `n`, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `r` is either '>' or '=' or '<', and the output "! [prev] [v1]" has been printed to the console and flushed.**

In this output state, the value of `prev` has been updated to 0, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The output "! [prev] [v1]" has already been printed to the console and flushed, and its value is not affected by the update of `prev`.
