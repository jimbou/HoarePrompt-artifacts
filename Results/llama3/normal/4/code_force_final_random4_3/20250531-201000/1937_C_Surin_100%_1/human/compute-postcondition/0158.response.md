The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 2, `n` is greater than `i`. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is greater than 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `i` which is greater than 3.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than `i` which is greater than 3, `i` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `kp` is 2, `v2` is equal to `i` which is greater than 3, `prev` is either 0 or `n-1`, `r` is a string containing one character ('>', '=', or '<'), `r2` is either '<' or an empty string. If `r` is '<', then `v1` is equal to `v2` which is equal to `i` which is greater than 3, the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either 0 or n-1 and v1 is equal to v2 which is equal to i which is greater than 3 is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? 0 0 [v2] [v2]" where v2 is equal to i which is greater than 3, and the standard output is flushed, and this is printed: "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" where v1 is equal to v2 which is equal to i which is greater than 3 and v2 is equal to i which is greater than 3, and the input is read from the user and stored in variable r. Otherwise, `v1` is 0.**
