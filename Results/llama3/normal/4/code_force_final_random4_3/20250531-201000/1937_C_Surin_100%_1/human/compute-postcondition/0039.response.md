The value of `prev` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), i is 1, g is 0, kp is 0, v2 is n-1, r is '=', prev is 1, r2 is '<', stdin contains t-n-2 inputs: an integer (n) (2 <= n <= 10^4).
