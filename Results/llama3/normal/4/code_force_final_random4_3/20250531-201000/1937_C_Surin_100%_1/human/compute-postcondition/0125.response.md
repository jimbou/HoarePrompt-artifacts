The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **n is an integer (3 <= n <= 10^3), i is 3, g is 0, kp is 1, v2 is n-1, v1 is n-1, r is a string containing one character ('>', '=', or '<'), r2 is either '<' or an empty string. If r is '>', then prev is 2. If r is '=', then if r2 is '<', prev is 2. Otherwise, prev is either 0 or 1. If r is '<', then the values of the variables remain unchanged.**
