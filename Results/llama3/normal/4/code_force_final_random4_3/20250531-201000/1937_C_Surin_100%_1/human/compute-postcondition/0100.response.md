Output State: **n is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), i is 1, g is 0, kp is 1, v2 is n-1, prev is 0, v1 is n-1, r is either '>' or '=' or '<', and the output "! [prev] [v1]" has been printed to the console and flushed, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is n-1, i is 1 and prev is 0, and the input has been read and assigned to r.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `g`, `kp`, `v2`, `prev`, and `v1` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The output to the console has been flushed, and the input has been read and assigned to `r`, which can take any of the three values: '>', '=', or '<'.
