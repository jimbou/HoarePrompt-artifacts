Output State: **`n` is an integer (3 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is 3, `g` is 0, `kp` is 0, `v2` is 3, `r` is the input string from stdin, `v1` is 3, stdin contains t-4 inputs: an integer (n) (2 <= n <= 10^4), and the string "? [v1] [v1] 3 3" is printed where [v1] is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `v1` has been updated to 3, which is the value of `v2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-4 inputs, and the string "? [v1] [v1] 3 3" is printed with [v1] being 3.
