The code prints a formatted string containing the values of `v1` and `v2`. 

The value of `v1` depends on the value of `r`. If `r` is '<', then `v1` is equal to `v2` which is equal to `i` which is greater than 3. Otherwise, `v1` is 0.

The value of `v2` is equal to `i` which is greater than 3.

Output: **? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2] (where v1 is either 0 or equal to v2 which is equal to i which is greater than 3, and v2 is equal to i which is greater than 3)**
