Postcondition: ***n is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), i is 2, g is 0, kp is 1, v2 is n-1, v1 is n-1, r is a string containing one character ('>', '=', or '<'), r2 is either '<' or an empty string. If r is '>', then prev is 2. If r is '=', then if r2 is '<', prev is 2. Otherwise, prev is either 0 or 1. If r is '<', then the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
