To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 1.

The state of `i` is already given as `n`, but for the loop to execute, `i` should be within the range of the loop, which starts from 1. Since `i` is `n` and `n` needs to be greater than 1 for the loop to execute, we can adjust the state of `i` to be greater than 1 as well.

The other variables (`g`, `kp`, `v2`, `prev`, `v1`, `r`, `r2`, and the output) are not directly related to the loop head and do not affect whether the loop will execute or not.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `kp` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is either 0 or `n-1`, `v1` is 0, `r` is a string containing one character ('>', '=', or '<'), `r2` is either '<' or an empty string, and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is either 0 or `n-1` and `v1` is 0 is flushed to the standard output**
