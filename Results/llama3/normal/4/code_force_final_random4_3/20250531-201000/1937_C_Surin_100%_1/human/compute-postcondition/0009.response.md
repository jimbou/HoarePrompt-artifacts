Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is 1, `g` is 0, `kp` is 0, `v1` is 1, `v2` is 1, `r` is '<', stdin contains t-2 inputs: an integer (n) (2 <= n <= 10^4)**

In this output state, the value of `v1` has been updated to be equal to `v2`, which is 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains t-2 inputs: an integer (n) (2 <= n <= 10^4).
