Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `kp` is 2, `v2` is greater than 1, `prev` is either 0 or `n-1`, `v1` is 0, `r` is a string containing one character ('>', '=', or '<'), `r2` is either '<' or an empty string, and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is either 0 or `n-1` and `v1` is 0 is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? 0 0 [v2] [v2]" where v2 is greater than 1**
