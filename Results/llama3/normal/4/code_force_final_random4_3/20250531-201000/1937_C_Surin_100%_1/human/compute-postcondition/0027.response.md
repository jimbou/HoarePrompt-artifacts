The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n` which does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2.
State: **`n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is 1, `g` is 0, `kp` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the input string from stdin, `prev` is 0, stdin contains t-n inputs: an integer (n) (2 <= n <= 10^4). If `r` is '<', then `v1` is `n-1` and the string "? [v1] [v1] (n-1) (n-1)" is printed where [v1] is `n-1`. Otherwise, the values of `v1` and the printed string are determined by the previous value of `r`.**
