To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for kp in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is `kp`, which is the loop counter. The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `kp` is 0, and `int(input())` is an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^3.

For the loop to execute one more time, `kp` must be incremented by 1, and `int(input())` must be greater than `kp`. Since `kp` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is `n`, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is either '>' or '=' or '<', `prev` is either 0 or the value of `i` in the last iteration where the user's response to the printed query "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" was '=' and the user's response to the printed query "? i i [prev] [prev]" was '<', and the output "! [prev] [v1]" has been printed to the console and flushed.**
