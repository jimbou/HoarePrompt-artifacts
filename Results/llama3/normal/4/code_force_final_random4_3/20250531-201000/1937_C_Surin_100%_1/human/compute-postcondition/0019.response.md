Output State: **`n` is an integer (3 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is 3, `g` is 0, `kp` is 0, `v2` is 3, `r` is the input string from stdin, stdin contains t-3 inputs: an integer (n) (2 <= n <= 10^4). If `r` is '<', then `v1` is 2. Otherwise, `v1` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `v2` has been updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `n`, `i`, `g`, `kp`, `r`, and `v1` are still valid, and the stdin still contains t-3 inputs.
