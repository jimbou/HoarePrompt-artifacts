Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than `i` which is greater than 3, `i` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `kp` is 2, `v2` is equal to `i` which is greater than 3, `prev` is either 0 or `n-1`, `r` is a string containing one character ('>', '=', or '<'), `r2` is either '<' or an empty string, `v1` is equal to `v2` which is equal to `i` which is greater than 3.**

In this output state, the value of `v1` has been updated to be equal to `v2`, which is equal to `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
