Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `kp` is 0, `v2` is 1, stdin contains t-1 inputs: an integer (n) (2 <= n <= 10^4)**

In this output state, the value of `v2` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 inputs, each being an integer (n) between 2 and 10^4.
