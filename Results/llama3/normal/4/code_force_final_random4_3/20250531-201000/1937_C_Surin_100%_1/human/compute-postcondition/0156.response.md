Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than `i` which is greater than 2, `i` is greater than 2, `g` is 0, `kp` is 2, `v2` is equal to `i` which is greater than 2, `prev` is either 0 or `n-1`, `v1` is equal to `v2` which is equal to `i` which is greater than 2, `r` is a string containing one character ('>', '=', or '<'), `r2` is either '<' or an empty string, and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either 0 or n-1 and v1 is equal to v2 which is equal to i which is greater than 2 is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? 0 0 [v2] [v2]" where v2 is equal to i which is greater than 2, and the standard output is flushed. If r is '<', then the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either 0 or n-1 and v1 is equal to v2 which is equal to i which is greater than 2 is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? 0 0 [v2] [v2]" where v2 is equal to i which is greater than 2, and the standard output is flushed, and this is printed: "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" where v1 is equal to v2 which is equal to i which is greater than 2 and v2 is equal to i which is greater than 2, and the input is read from the user and stored in variable r.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `i`, `g`, `kp`, `v2`, `prev`, `r`, and `r2` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `v1` is updated to be equal to `v2`, which is equal to `i` which is greater than 2. The output and print statements are also updated accordingly.
