Postcondition: **n is an integer (4 <= n <= 10^3), i is 3, g is 0, kp is 1, v2 is 3, prev is either 0 or the value of i in the last iteration where the user's response to the printed query "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" was '=' and the user's response to the printed query "? i i [prev] [prev]" was '<', v1 is either 2 or 3 depending on the user's response to the query "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]", and the output "! [prev] [v1]" has been printed to the console and flushed, and the output "? 0 0 1 1" has been printed to the console and flushed, and the output "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" has been printed to the console and flushed, and the output "? 2 2 3 3" has been printed to the console and flushed, and the output of sys.stdout.flush() has been executed, and the output of r = input('') has been executed.**
