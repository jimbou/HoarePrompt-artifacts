The only variable in the loop head is variable `kp`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `kp`. If `kp` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `kp` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `kp` must be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is `n`, `g` is 0, `kp` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is either 0 or `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `r` is a string containing one character ('>', '=', or '<'), `r2` is either '<' or an empty string, and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is either 0 or `n-1` and `v1` is `n-1` is flushed to the standard output.**
