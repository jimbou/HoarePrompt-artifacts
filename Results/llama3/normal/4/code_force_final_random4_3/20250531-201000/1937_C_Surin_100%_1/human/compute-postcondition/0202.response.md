Output State: **n is greater than 2, i is increased by 2, g is 0, kp is 2, v2 is equal to n-1, r is either '>' or '=' or '<', r2 is either '>' or '=' or '<', and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either 0 or n-1 or i and v1 is equal to n-1 is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [i] [n-1] [prev]" and "? [i] [i] [prev] [prev]" and "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is equal to n-1 and prev is either 0 or n-1 or i depending on the value of r. If r is '=', then r2 is either '>' or '=' or '<'. If r2 is '<', then prev is equal to i and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is equal to i and v1 is equal to n-1 is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "?

The first line flushes the output to the standard output. The second line assigns the input to `r2`. The value of `r2` is either '>' or '=' or '<'. The value of `i` is increased by 1. The value of `n` is greater than 2. The value of `g` is 0. The value of `kp` is 2. The value of `v2` is equal to `n-1`. The value of `r` is either '>' or '=' or '<'. The output "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is either 0 or `n-1` or `i` and `v1` is equal to `n-1` is flushed to the standard output. The output "? [n-1] [i] [n-1] [prev]" and "? [i] [i] [prev] [prev]" and "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where `v1` is equal to `n-1` and `prev` is either 0 or `n-1` or `i` depending on the value of `r` is printed. If `r` is '=', then `r2` is either '>' or '=' or '<'. If `r2` is '<', then `prev` is equal to `i` and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is equal to `i` and `v1` is equal to `n-1` is flushed to the standard output. The output "? [n-1] [i] [n-1] [prev]" where `prev` is equal to `i` is printed. If `r2` is not '<', then no changes are made to `prev` and the output is not flushed to the standard output. The output "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where `v1` is equal to `n-1` and `prev` is either 0 or `n-1` or `i` depending on the value of `r` is printed. The output "? [i] [i] [prev] [prev]" where `i` is increased by 1 and `prev` is either 0 or `n-1` or `i` depending on the value of `r` is printed.
