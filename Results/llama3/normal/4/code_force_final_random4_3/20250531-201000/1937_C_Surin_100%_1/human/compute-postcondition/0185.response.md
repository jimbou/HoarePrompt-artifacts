Output: **n is greater than 1, i is less than n and i is increased by 1, g is 0, kp is 2, v2 is equal to n-1, and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either 0 or n-1 and v1 is equal to n-1 is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [i] [n-1] [prev]". If r is '>', then prev is equal to i. If r is not '>', then prev is equal to i if r is not '=', otherwise prev remains 0, and this is printed: ? [i] [i] [prev] [prev]. The following is printed: ? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev] where v1 is equal to n-1 and prev is either 0 or n-1 or i depending on the value of r**
