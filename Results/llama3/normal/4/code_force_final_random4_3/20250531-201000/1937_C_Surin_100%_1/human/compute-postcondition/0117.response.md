The code `prev = i` assigns the value of `i` to `prev`. Since `i` is 2, `prev` is now 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is 2, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `r` is a string containing one character ('>', '=', or '<'), `prev` is 2, `r2` is either '<' or an empty string.**
