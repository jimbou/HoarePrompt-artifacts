Output State: **`n` is an integer (3 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is 3, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `r` is a string containing one character ('>', '=', or '<'), `r2` is a string containing one character ('<' or ''), `prev` is 3**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state are still valid, and a new variable `prev` has been added, which is assigned the value of `i`, which is 3.
