Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `n` and `i` is increased by 1, `g` is 0, `kp` is 2, `v2` is equal to `n-1`, `r` is either '>' or '=' or '<', `r2` is either '>' or '=' or '<', `prev` is equal to `i`, and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is equal to `i` and `v1` is equal to `n-1` is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [i] [n-1] [prev]" where `prev` is equal to `i`. If `r` is '>', then `prev` is equal to `i`. If `r` is not '>', then `prev` is equal to `i` if `r` is not '=', otherwise `prev` remains `i`, and this is printed: ? [i] [i] [prev] [prev] where `prev` is equal to `i`. The following is printed: ? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev] where `v1` is equal to `n-1` and `prev` is equal to `i`, and this is printed: ? [i] [i] [prev] [prev] where `i` is less than `n` and `i` is increased by 1, and `prev` is equal to `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `prev` is updated to be equal to `i`, which is less than `n` and has been increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The output and printed statements are updated accordingly, with `prev` being equal to `i` in all cases.
