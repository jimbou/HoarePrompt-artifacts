Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (3 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is 3, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `r` is a string containing one character ('>', '=', or '<'), `r2` is a string containing one character ('<' or ''). If `r` is '=', then if `r2` is '<', `prev` is 3. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `r` is not '=', then the initial values of `prev` are maintained, which are either 2 if `r` is '>' or either 0 or 1 if `r` is '=' and `r2` is not '<'.***
