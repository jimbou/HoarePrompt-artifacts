Output State: **n is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), i is 1, g is 0, kp is 1, v2 is n-1, prev is 0, v1 is n-1, r is '=', r2 is an empty string**.

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line, `sys.stdout.flush()`, flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the console immediately. This line does not affect any variables.

The second line, `r2 = input('')`, reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `r2`. Since the input is empty (`''`), `r2` becomes an empty string.

All other variables (`n`, `i`, `g`, `kp`, `v2`, `prev`, `v1`, and `r`) remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code snippet. The output state reflects the updated value of `r2` and the unchanged values of all other variables.
