Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is `n`, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is either 0 or `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `r` is a string containing one character ('>', '=', or '<'), `r2` is either '<' or an empty string, and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is either 0 or `n-1` and `v1` is `n-1` is flushed to the standard output.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, ensuring that the printed output "! [prev] [v1]" is immediately displayed on the screen. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `g`, `kp`, `v2`, `prev`, `v1`, `r`, and `r2` remain unchanged.
