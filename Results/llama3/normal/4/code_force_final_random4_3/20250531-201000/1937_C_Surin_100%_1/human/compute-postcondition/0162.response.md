Output State: **n is an integer greater than i which is greater than 3, i is greater than 3, g is 0, kp is 2, v2 is equal to i which is greater than 3, prev is either 0 or n-1, r is a string containing one character ('>', '=', or '<'), r2 is either '<' or an empty string. If r is '<', then v1 is equal to v2 which is equal to i which is greater than 3, the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either 0 or n-1 and v1 is equal to v2 which is equal to i which is greater than 3 is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? 0 0 [v2] [v2]" where v2 is equal to i which is greater than 3, and the standard output is flushed, and this is printed: "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" where v1 is equal to v2 which is equal to i which is greater than 3 and v2 is equal to i which is greater than 3, and the input is read from the user and stored in variable r. Otherwise, v1 is 0, and this is printed: "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" where v1 is either 0 or equal to v2 which is equal to i which is greater than 3 and v2 is equal to i which is greater than 3.**
