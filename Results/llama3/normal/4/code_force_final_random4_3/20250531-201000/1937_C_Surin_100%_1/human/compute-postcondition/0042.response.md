Postcondition: **n is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), i is 1, g is 0, kp is 0, v2 is n-1. If r is '>', then the current value of r is '>', and the values of v1 and the printed string are determined by the previous value of r, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where [v1] is the value of v1, [i] is 1, [prev] is 1. If r is '<', then v1 is n-1 and the string "? [v1] [v1] (n-1) (n-1)" is printed where [v1] is n-1. If r is not '>' or '<', then if r is '=', prev is 1 if r2 is '<', otherwise prev is 0. If r is not '=', the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
