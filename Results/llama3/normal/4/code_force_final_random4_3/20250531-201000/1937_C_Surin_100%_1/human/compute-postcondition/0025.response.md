Output State: **n is an integer (n <= n <= 10^3), i is n, g is 0, kp is 0, v2 is n-1, r is the input string from stdin, stdin contains t-n inputs: an integer (n) (2 <= n <= 10^4). If r is '<', then v1 is n-1 and the string "? [v1] [v1] (n-1) (n-1)" is printed where [v1] is n-1. Otherwise, the values of v1 and the printed string are determined by the previous value of r.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the following characteristics:

* The value of `n` remains unchanged.
* The loop counter `i` will be equal to `n`.
* The values of `g` and `kp` remain unchanged at 0.
* The value of `v2` will be `n-1`.
* The value of `r` will be the last input string read from `stdin`.
* The number of remaining inputs in `stdin` will be `t-n`, where `t` is the initial number of inputs.
* If the last input string `r` is '<', then `v1` will be `n-1`, and the last printed string will be "? [v1] [v1] (n-1) (n-1)" where [v1] is `n-1`. Otherwise, the values of `v1` and the printed string will depend on the previous value of `r`.
