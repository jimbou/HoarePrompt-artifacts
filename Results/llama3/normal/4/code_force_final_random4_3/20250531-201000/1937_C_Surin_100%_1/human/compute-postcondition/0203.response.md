Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is increased by 2, `g` is 0, `kp` is 2, `v2` is equal to `n-1`, `r` is either '>' or '=' or '<', `r2` is either '>' or '=' or '<', `prev` is equal to `i` which is increased by 2, and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is equal to i and v1 is equal to n-1 is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [i] [n-1] [prev]" and "? [i] [i] [prev] [prev]" and "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is equal to n-1 and prev is equal to i depending on the value of r. If r is '=', then r2 is either '>' or '=' or '<'. If r2 is '<', then the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is equal to i and v1 is equal to n-1 is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [i] [n-1] [prev]" where prev is equal to i. If r2 is not '<', then no changes are made to prev and the output is not flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is equal to n-1 and prev is equal to i depending on the value of r, and this is printed: "? [i] [i] [prev] [prev]" where i is increased by 1 and prev is equal to i depending on the value of r.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `prev` is updated to be equal to `i`, which is increased by 2. The rest of the variables remain the same. The output and print statements are updated accordingly based on the values of `r` and `r2`.
