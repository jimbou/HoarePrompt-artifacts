The code prints a formatted string containing a question mark, the value of `i` (which is 3), the value of `i` again (which is 3), the value of `prev`, and the value of `prev` again.

The value of `prev` depends on the values of `r` and `r2`. If `r` is '>', then `prev` is 2. If `r` is '=', then if `r2` is '<', `prev` is 2. Otherwise, `prev` is either 0 or 1.

Since the exact values of `r` and `r2` are not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `prev`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output a string with the question mark, the value of `i` (which is 3), and the value of `prev` (which depends on the values of `r` and `r2`).

Output: **? 3 3 [prev] [prev] (where [prev] is either 0, 1, or 2, depending on the values of r and r2)**
