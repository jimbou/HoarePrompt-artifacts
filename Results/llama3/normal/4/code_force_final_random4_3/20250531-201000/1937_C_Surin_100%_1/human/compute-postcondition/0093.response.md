Output State: **n is an integer (4 <= n <= 10^3), i is 3, g is 0, kp is 1, v2 is 3, prev is either 0 or the value of i in the last iteration where the user's response to the printed query "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" was '=' and the user's response to the printed query "? i i [prev] [prev]" was '<', v1 is 3, r is a string containing the user's response to the query "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]", and the output "! [prev] [v1]" has been printed to the console and flushed, and the output "? 0 0 1 1" has been printed to the console and flushed, and the output "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" has been printed to the console and flushed, and the output "? 2 2 3 3" has been printed to the console and flushed, and the output of sys.stdout.flush() has been executed, and the output of r = input('') has been executed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of v1 has been updated to 3, which is the same as the value of v2. All other variables remain unchanged. The program has printed several queries to the console and flushed the output, and has also executed sys.stdout.flush() and r = input('') to get the user's response.
