Output State: **n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), g is 0, v1 is 0, kp is 0, stdin contains t-1 inputs: an integer (n) (2 <= n <= 10^4)**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, which is the input read from stdin. The variables `g` and `v1` are initialized to 0. The value of `kp` remains unchanged at 0. After reading the first input, stdin still contains t-1 inputs, each being an integer `n` between 2 and 10^4.
