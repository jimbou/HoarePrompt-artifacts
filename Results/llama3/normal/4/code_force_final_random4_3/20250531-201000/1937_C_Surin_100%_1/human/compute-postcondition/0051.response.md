Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is 2, `g` is 0, `kp` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is a string containing the user's response to the printed query "? [v1] [2] [v1] [prev]", `r2` is a string containing the user's response to the printed query "? 2 2 [prev] [prev]", `prev` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `prev` is now 2, which is the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
