Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `kp` is 2, `v2` is greater than 1, `prev` is either 0 or `n-1`, `v1` is equal to `v2` which is greater than 1, the output "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is either 0 or `n-1` and `v1` is equal to `v2` which is greater than 1 is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? 0 0 [v2] [v2]" where `v2` is greater than 1, and the standard output is flushed, `r` is '<', `r2` is either '<' or an empty string.**

In this output state, the value of `v1` has been updated to be equal to `v2`, which is greater than 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The output to the standard output also remains the same, with the values of `prev` and `v1` being either 0 or `n-1` and greater than 1, respectively.
