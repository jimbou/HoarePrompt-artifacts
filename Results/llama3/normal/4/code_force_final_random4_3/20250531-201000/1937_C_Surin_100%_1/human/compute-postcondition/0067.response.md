Output State: **n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), i is n, g is 0, kp is 0, v2 is n-1, r is either '>' or '=' or '<', prev is either 0 or the value of i in the last iteration where the user's response to the printed query "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" was '=' and the user's response to the printed query "? i i [prev] [prev]" was '<'.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will execute n-1 times. After the loop finishes executing, the value of i will be equal to n. The values of g, kp, and v2 will remain unchanged. The value of r will be either '>' or '=' or '<', depending on the user's response to the last query. The value of prev will be either 0 or the value of i in the last iteration where the user's response to the printed query "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" was '=' and the user's response to the printed query "? i i [prev] [prev]" was '<'.
