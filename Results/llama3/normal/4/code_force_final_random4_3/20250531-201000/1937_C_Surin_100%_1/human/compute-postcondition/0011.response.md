The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **n is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), i is 2, g is 0, kp is 0, v1 is 1 if r is '<', otherwise v1 is 0, v2 is 1, r is '<' if it was '<', otherwise r is unchanged, stdin contains t-2 inputs: an integer (n) (2 <= n <= 10^4)**
