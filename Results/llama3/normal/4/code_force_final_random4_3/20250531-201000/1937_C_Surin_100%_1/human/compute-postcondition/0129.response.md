Output State: **`n` is an integer (3 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is 3, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v2` is n-1, `v1` is n-1, `r` is a string containing one character ('>', '=', or '<'), `r2` is either '<' or an empty string, `prev` is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `prev` has been updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
