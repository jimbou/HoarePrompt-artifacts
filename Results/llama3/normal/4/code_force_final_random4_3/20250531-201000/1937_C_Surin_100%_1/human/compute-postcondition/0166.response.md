Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `g` is 0, `kp` is 2, `v2` is equal to `n-1`, `prev` is 0, `r` is a string containing one character ('>', '=', or '<'), `r2` is either '<' or an empty string, and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either 0 or n-1 and v1 is equal to n-1 is flushed to the standard output.**

In this output state, the value of `prev` has been updated to 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The output to the standard output is still the same, with `prev` being either 0 or `n-1` and `v1` being equal to `n-1`.
