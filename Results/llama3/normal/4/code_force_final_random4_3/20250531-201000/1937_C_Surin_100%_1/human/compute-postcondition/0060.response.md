The code prints a formatted string containing the character '?' followed by the value of `i` (which is 3) repeated twice, and the value of `prev` (which is not defined in the initial state) repeated twice.

Since the exact value of `prev` is not provided, we can't determine its exact value. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the character '?' followed by the value of `i` (which is 3) repeated twice, and the value of `prev` repeated twice.

Output: **? 3 3 [prev] [prev] (where prev is the value of prev)**
