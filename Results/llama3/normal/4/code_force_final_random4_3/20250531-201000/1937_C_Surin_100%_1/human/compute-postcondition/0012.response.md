Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is 2, `g` is 0, `kp` is 0, `v1` is 1 if `r` is '<', otherwise `v1` is 0, `v2` is 2, `r` is '<' if it was '<', otherwise `r` is unchanged, stdin contains t-2 inputs: an integer (n) (2 <= n <= 10^4)**

In this output state, the value of `v2` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-2 inputs. The conditions on `n`, `i`, `g`, `kp`, `v1`, and `r` are still valid.
