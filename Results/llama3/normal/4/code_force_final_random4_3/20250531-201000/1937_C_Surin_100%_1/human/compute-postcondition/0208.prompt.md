Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `g` is 0, `kp` is 2, `v2` is equal to `n-1`, `prev` is 0, `r` is a string containing one character ('>', '=', or '<'), `r2` is either '<' or an empty string, and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either 0 or n-1 and v1 is equal to n-1 is flushed to the standard output.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    r = input()
    if r == '>':
        prev = i
    elif r == '=':
        print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r2 = input('')
        if r2 == '<':
            prev = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is greater than 1, i is less than n, g is 0, kp is 2, v2 is equal to n-1, and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either 0 or n-1 and v1 is equal to n-1 is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [i] [n-1] [prev]". If r is '>', then prev is equal to i. If r is not '>', then prev is equal to i if r is not '=', otherwise prev remains 0, and this is printed: ? [i] [i] [prev] [prev].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is greater than 1, i is less than n and i is increased by 1, g is 0, kp is 2, v2 is equal to n-1, r is either '>' or '=' or '<', and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either 0 or n-1 or i and v1 is equal to n-1 is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [i] [n-1] [prev]" and "? [i] [i] [prev] [prev]" and "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is equal to n-1 and prev is either 0 or n-1 or i depending on the value of r. If r is '=', then r2 is either '>' or '=' or '<'. If r2 is '<', then prev is equal to i and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is equal to i and v1 is equal to n-1 is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [i] [n-1] [prev]" where prev is equal to i. If r2 is not '<', then no changes are made to prev and the output is not flushed to the standard output.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is greater than 2, i is increased by 1, g is 0, kp is 2, v2 is equal to n-1, r is either '>' or '=' or '<', and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either 0 or n-1 or i and v1 is equal to n-1 is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [i] [n-1] [prev]" and "? [i] [i] [prev] [prev]" and "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is equal to n-1 and prev is either 0 or n-1 or i depending on the value of r. If r is '=', then r2 is either '>' or '=' or '<'. If r2 is '<', then prev is equal to i and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is equal to i and v1 is equal to n-1 is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [i] [n-1] [prev]" where prev is equal to i. If r2 is not '<', then no changes are made to prev and the output is not flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is equal to n-1 and prev is either 0 or n-1 or i depending on the value of r. If r is '=', then i is increased by 2, and if r2 is '<', then prev is equal to i and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is equal to i and v1 is equal to n-1 is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [i] [n-1] [prev]" and "? [i] [i] [prev] [prev]" and "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is equal to n-1 and prev is equal to i depending on the value of r. If r2 is not '<', then no changes are made to prev and the output is not flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is equal to n-1 and prev is either 0 or n-1 or i depending on the value of r, and this is printed: "? [i] [i] [prev] [prev]" where i is increased by 1 and prev is either 0 or n-1 or i depending on the value of r. If r is '>', then prev is equal to i.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
