Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and uses the allowed queries to find the pair of indices i and j such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The program first finds the index v1 of the maximum value in the permutation p using n-1 queries. This is done by comparing the maximum value of each pair of indices (v1, v1) and (i, i) for i from 1 to n-1. If the result is '<', it means that the maximum value is at index i, so v1 is updated to i.

2. After finding the maximum value v1, the program finds the index prev of the minimum value in the permutation p using n-1 queries. This is done by comparing the maximum value of each pair of indices (v1, i) and (v1, prev) for i from 1 to n-1. If the result is '>', it means that the minimum value is at index i, so prev is updated to i. If the result is '=', it means that the values at indices i and prev are equal, so the program compares the values at indices (i, i) and (prev, prev) to determine which one is smaller.

3. Finally, the program prints the pair of indices (prev, v1) as the answer.

The program uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit. The program also correctly handles the case where the permutation p is fixed and does not change during the interaction.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
