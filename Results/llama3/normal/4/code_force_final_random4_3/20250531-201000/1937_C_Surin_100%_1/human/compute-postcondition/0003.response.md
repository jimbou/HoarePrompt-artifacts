According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and `i` is now 1.
State: **`n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `kp` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 inputs: an integer (n) (2 <= n <= 10^4)**
