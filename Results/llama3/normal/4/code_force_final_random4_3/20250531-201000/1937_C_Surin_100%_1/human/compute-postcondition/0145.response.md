The `print` statement will print a formatted string containing the values of `v1` and `v2`. Based on the initial state, `v1` is 0 and `v2` is greater than 1.

The string will be in the format '? 0 0 [v2] [v2]', where [v2] represents the actual value of `v2`, which is greater than 1.

Output: **? 0 0 [v2] [v2] (where [v2] is the value of v2, which is greater than 1)**
