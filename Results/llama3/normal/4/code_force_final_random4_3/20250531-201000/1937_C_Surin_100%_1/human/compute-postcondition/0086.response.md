Output State: **n is an integer (3 <= n <= 10^3), i is 2, g is 0, kp is 1, v2 is 2, prev is either 0 or the value of i in the last iteration where the user's response to the printed query "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" was '=' and the user's response to the printed query "? i i [prev] [prev]" was '<', v1 is 2, r is a string containing the user's response to the query "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]", and the output "! [prev] [v1]" has been printed to the console and flushed, and the output "? 0 0 1 1" has been printed to the console and flushed, and the output "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" has been printed to the console and flushed.**

In this output state, the value of `v1` has been updated to 2, which is the value of `v2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
