Postcondition: ***n is greater than 1, i is less than n, g is 0, kp is 2, v2 is equal to n-1, and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either 0 or n-1 and v1 is equal to n-1 is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [i] [n-1] [prev]", and this is printed: ? [i] [i] [prev] [prev]. If r is '=', then prev remains 0, otherwise prev is equal to i.***
