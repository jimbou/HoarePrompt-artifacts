Based on the precondition, the values of the variables are as follows:

- `v1` is 0
- `v2` is 1

The `print` statement is printing a formatted string that includes these values. The string is in the format '? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}'.

Therefore, when the `print` statement is executed, it will print the string with the values of `v1` and `v2` inserted into it.

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
