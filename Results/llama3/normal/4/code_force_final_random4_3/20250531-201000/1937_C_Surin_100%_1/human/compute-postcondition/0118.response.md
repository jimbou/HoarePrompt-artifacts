Based on the initial state, the variables `i`, `prev` are used in the print statement. 

`i` is given as 2. 
`prev` is either 0 or 1.

So, the print statement will print a string that includes the value of `i` (which is 2) and the value of `prev` (which is either 0 or 1).

Output: **? 2 2 [prev] [prev] (where prev is either 0 or 1)**
