Based on the initial state, the code will print a string in the format '? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]'.

Here's a breakdown of the variables:

*   `v1` is equal to `n-1`.
*   `i` is less than `n` and has been increased by 1.
*   `prev` is either 0 or `n-1`, depending on the value of `r`. If `r` is '>', then `prev` is equal to `i`. If `r` is not '>', then `prev` is equal to `i` if `r` is not '=', otherwise `prev` remains 0.

So, the output will be a string with `n-1` in place of `v1`, the current value of `i` in place of `i`, `n-1` again in place of the second `v1`, and either `i` or 0 in place of `prev`, depending on the value of `r`.

Output: **? [n-1] [i] [n-1] [i or 0]**
