Output: **`n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is 1, `g` is 0, `kp` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the input string from stdin, `prev` is 0, stdin contains t-n inputs: an integer (n) (2 <= n <= 10^4). If `r` is '<', then `v1` is `n-1` and the string "? [v1] [v1] (n-1) (n-1)" is printed where [v1] is `n-1`. Otherwise, the values of `v1` and the printed string are determined by the previous value of `r`, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where [v1] is the value of v1, [i] is 1, [prev] is 0.**
