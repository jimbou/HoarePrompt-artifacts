Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), i is n, g is 0, kp is 1, v2 is n-1, r is either '>' or '=' or '<', prev is either 0 or the value of i in the last iteration where the user's response to the printed query "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" was '=' and the user's response to the printed query "? i i [prev] [prev]" was '<', and the output "! [prev] [v1]" has been printed to the console and flushed, v1 is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    v2 = i
    print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    r = input('')
    if r == '<':
        v1 = v2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is 1, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v2` is 1, `prev` is either 0 or the value of `i` in the last iteration where the user's response to the printed query "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" was '=' and the user's response to the printed query "? i i [prev] [prev]" was '<', `v1` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either an empty string or '<', and the output "! [prev] [v1]" has been printed to the console and flushed, and the output "? 0 0 1 1" has been printed to the console and flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer (3 <= n <= 10^3), i is 2, g is 0, kp is 1, v2 is 2, prev is either 0 or the value of i in the last iteration where the user's response to the printed query "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" was '=' and the user's response to the printed query "? i i [prev] [prev]" was '<', v1 is either 0 or 1 or 2, r is a string containing the user's response to the query "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]", and the output "! [prev] [v1]" has been printed to the console and flushed, and the output "? 0 0 1 1" has been printed to the console and flushed, and the output "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" has been printed to the console and flushed. If the user's response to the query "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" was '<', then v1 is 2. Otherwise, v1 is either 0 or 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer (4 <= n <= 10^3), i is 3, g is 0, kp is 1, v2 is 3, prev is either 0 or the value of i in the last iteration where the user's response to the printed query "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" was '=' and the user's response to the printed query "? i i [prev] [prev]" was '<', v1 is either 2 or 3 depending on the user's response to the query "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]", and the output "! [prev] [v1]" has been printed to the console and flushed, and the output "? 0 0 1 1" has been printed to the console and flushed, and the output "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" has been printed to the console and flushed, and the output "? 2 2 3 3" has been printed to the console and flushed, and the output of sys.stdout.flush() has been executed, and the output of r = input('') has been executed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
