Output State: **n is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), i is 1, g is 0, kp is 1, v2 is n-1, prev is 1, v1 is n-1, the output "! [prev] [v1]" has been printed to the console and flushed, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is n-1, i is 1 and prev is 0, and the input has been read and assigned to r. The current value of r is '>'**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `prev` has been updated to the current value of `i`, which is 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The output and input operations have already been performed, and the value of `r` is still `'>'`.
