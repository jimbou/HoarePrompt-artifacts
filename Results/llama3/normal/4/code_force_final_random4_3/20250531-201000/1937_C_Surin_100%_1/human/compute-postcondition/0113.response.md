To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive).

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is 2, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v2` is n-1, `v1` is n-1. If `r` is '>', then `prev` is 1. If `r` is '=', then `prev` is 1 and `r2` is '<' if `r2` is '<', otherwise `prev` is 0 and `r2` is an empty string. If `r` is '<', then no changes are made to `prev` and `r2`.**
