Output State: **`n` is an integer (3 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is 3, `g` is 0, `kp` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is either '>' or '=' or '<', `r2` is either '>' or '=' or '<', `prev` is 3, and "? 3 3 prev prev" is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `prev` is updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the printed statement "? 3 3 prev prev" is still present.
