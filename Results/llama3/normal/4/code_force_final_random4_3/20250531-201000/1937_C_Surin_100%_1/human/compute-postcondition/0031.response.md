Postcondition: **n is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), i is 1, g is 0, kp is 0, v2 is n-1, r is the input string from stdin, prev is 0, stdin contains t-n-1 inputs: an integer (n) (2 <= n <= 10^4). The current value of r is '>', and the values of v1 and the printed string are determined by the previous value of r, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where [v1] is the value of v1, [i] is 1, [prev] is 0.**
