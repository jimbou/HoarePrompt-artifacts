Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `n`, `g` is 0, `kp` is 2, `v2` is equal to `n-1`, `prev` is equal to `i`, `r` is a string containing the character '>', and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is either 0 or `n-1` and `v1` is equal to `n-1` is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [i] [n-1] [prev]"**

In this output state, the value of `prev` has been updated to be equal to `i`, which is less than `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. The output and print statements are still present in the output state, indicating that they have been executed but their effects are not reflected in the variable values.
