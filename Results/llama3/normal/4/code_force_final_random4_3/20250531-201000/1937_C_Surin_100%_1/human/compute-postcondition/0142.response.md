Output State: **n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), i is n, g is 0, kp is 2, v2 is n-1, prev is either 0 or n-1, v1 is 0, r is a string containing one character ('>', '=', or '<'), r2 is either '<' or an empty string, and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either 0 or n-1 and v1 is 0 is flushed to the standard output.**

The code snippet provided modifies the values of `n`, `g`, and `v1`. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, replacing its previous value. The second line sets `g` to 0, and the third line sets `v1` to 0. The other variables (`i`, `kp`, `v2`, `prev`, `r`, and `r2`) remain unchanged. The output state reflects these changes, with `n` being an integer between 1 and 10^3, `g` being 0, and `v1` being 0. The output "! [prev] [v1]" is flushed to the standard output, where `prev` is either 0 or `n-1` and `v1` is 0.
