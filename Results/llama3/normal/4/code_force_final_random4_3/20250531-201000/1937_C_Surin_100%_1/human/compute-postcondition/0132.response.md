Output State: **n is an integer (3 <= n <= 10^3), i is 3, g is 0, kp is 1, v2 is n-1, v1 is n-1, r is a string containing one character ('>', '=', or '<'), r2 is a string containing one character ('<' or '')**.

The code snippet provided does not modify the values of `n`, `i`, `g`, `kp`, `v2`, or `v1`. The `sys.stdout.flush()` line does not affect any variables. The `r2 = input('')` line assigns a new value to `r2`, which is a string containing one character ('<' or ''). The value of `r` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `prev` is not affected by the code, as it is only used in the printed statement and not modified afterwards.
