The function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer (t) represents the number of test cases, and each test case consists of an integer (n) representing the size of a sequence. For each test case, the function performs a series of queries to determine the maximum and second maximum elements in the sequence, and then outputs the indices of these two elements in the format "! [prev] [v1]", where prev is the index of the maximum element and v1 is the index of the second maximum element. The function repeats this process for each test case.
