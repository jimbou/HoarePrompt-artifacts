Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is `n`, `g` is 0, `kp` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the input string from stdin, `prev` is 0, stdin contains t-n inputs: an integer (n) (2 <= n <= 10^4). If `r` is '<', then `v1` is `n-1` and the string "? [v1] [v1] (n-1) (n-1)" is printed where [v1] is `n-1`. Otherwise, the values of `v1` and the printed string are determined by the previous value of `r`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    r = input()
    if r == '>':
        prev = i
    elif r == '=':
        print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r2 = input('')
        if r2 == '<':
            prev = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), i is 1, g is 0, kp is 0, v2 is n-1. If r is '>', then the current value of r is '>', and the values of v1 and the printed string are determined by the previous value of r, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where [v1] is the value of v1, [i] is 1, [prev] is 1. If r is '<', then v1 is n-1 and the string "? [v1] [v1] (n-1) (n-1)" is printed where [v1] is n-1. If r is not '>' or '<', then if r is '=', prev is 1 if r2 is '<', otherwise prev is 0. If r is not '=', the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), i is 2, g is 0, kp is 0, v2 is n-1. If the user's response to the printed query "? [v1] [2] [v1] [prev]" is '>', then prev is 2. If the user's response is '=', then the user's response to the printed query "? 2 2 [prev] [prev]" is checked. If the response to the second query is '<', then prev is 2. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer (3 <= n <= 10^3), i is 3, g is 0, kp is 0, v2 is n-1, r is either '>' or '=' or '<'. If r is '>', then prev is 3. If r is not '>', then r2 is either '>' or '=' or '<'. If r is '=', then "? 3 3 prev prev" is printed. If r2 is '<', then prev is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
