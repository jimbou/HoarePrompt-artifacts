The code prints a formatted string containing the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1`, and `prev`. 

Since `v1` is equal to `n-1`, the first and third values in the output will be `n-1`. 

The value of `i` is increased by 1, but its initial value is not specified. However, we know that `i` is used in the context of a loop or iteration, so let's assume it has some integer value.

The value of `prev` depends on the value of `r`. If `r` is '=', then `r2` is either '>' or '=' or '<'. If `r2` is '<', then `prev` is equal to `i`. If `r2` is not '<', then no changes are made to `prev`, but its initial value is either 0 or `n-1` or `i`.

Output: **? [n-1] [i] [n-1] [prev] (where n-1 is the value of v1, i is the value of i, and prev is either 0 or n-1 or i depending on the value of r)**
