Output State: **stdin contains one input: an integer (t) (1 <= t <= 10^3), then t times an integer (n) (2 <= n <= 10^4), I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin.**

Explanation: The code defines two lambda functions, I and R. The I function takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, split by spaces. The R function takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin. The initial state of stdin remains unchanged, as the code does not modify it. The functions I and R are now defined and can be used to read input from stdin.
