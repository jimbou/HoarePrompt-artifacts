Output State: **n is an integer (3 <= n <= 10^3), i is 3, g is 0, kp is 0, v2 is n-1, r is either '>' or '=' or '<'**.

The code prints the query "? [v1] [2] [v1] [prev]" and then waits for the user's response. The response is stored in the variable `r`. The value of `r` depends on the user's input, which can be either '>' or '=' or '<'. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
