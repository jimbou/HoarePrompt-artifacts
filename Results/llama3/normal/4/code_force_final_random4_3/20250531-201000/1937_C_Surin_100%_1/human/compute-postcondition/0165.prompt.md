Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), i is n, g is 0, kp is 2, v2 is n-1, prev is either 0 or n-1, v1 is 0, r is a string containing one character ('>', '=', or '<'), r2 is either '<' or an empty string, and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either 0 or n-1 and v1 is 0 is flushed to the standard output.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    v2 = i
    print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    r = input('')
    if r == '<':
        v1 = v2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer greater than 1, i is greater than 1, g is 0, kp is 2, v2 is greater than 1, prev is either 0 or n-1, v1 is 0, r is a string containing one character ('>', '=', or '<'), r2 is either '<' or an empty string, and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either 0 or n-1 and v1 is 0 is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? 0 0 [v2] [v2]" where v2 is greater than 1, and the standard output is flushed. If r is '<', then v1 is equal to v2 which is greater than 1, the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either 0 or n-1 and v1 is equal to v2 which is greater than 1 is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? 0 0 [v2] [v2]" where v2 is greater than 1, and the standard output is flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than `i` which is greater than 2, `i` is greater than 2, `g` is 0, `kp` is 2, `v2` is equal to `i` which is greater than 2, `prev` is either 0 or `n-1`, `r` is a string containing one character ('>', '=', or '<'), `r2` is either '<' or an empty string. If `r` is '<', then `v1` is equal to `v2` which is equal to `i` which is greater than 2, the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either 0 or n-1 and v1 is equal to v2 which is equal to i which is greater than 2 is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? 0 0 [v2] [v2]" where v2 is equal to i which is greater than 2, and the standard output is flushed, and this is printed: "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" where v1 is equal to v2 which is equal to i which is greater than 2 and v2 is equal to i which is greater than 2, and the input is read from the user and stored in variable r. Otherwise, `v1` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than i which is greater than 3, i is greater than 3, g is 0, kp is 2, v2 is equal to i which is greater than 3, prev is either 0 or n-1, r is a string containing one character ('>', '=', or '<'), r2 is either '<' or an empty string. If r is '<', then v1 is equal to v2 which is equal to i which is greater than 3, the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either 0 or n-1 and v1 is equal to v2 which is equal to i which is greater than 3 is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? 0 0 [v2] [v2]" where v2 is equal to i which is greater than 3, and the standard output is flushed, and this is printed: "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" where v1 is equal to v2 which is equal to i which is greater than 3 and v2 is equal to i which is greater than 3, and the input is read from the user and stored in variable r. Otherwise, v1 is 0, and this is printed: "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" where v1 is either 0 or equal to v2 which is equal to i which is greater than 3 and v2 is equal to i which is greater than 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
