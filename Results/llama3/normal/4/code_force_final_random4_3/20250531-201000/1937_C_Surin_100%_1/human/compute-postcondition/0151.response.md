The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is greater than 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `i` which is greater than 2.
State: **n is an integer greater than i which is greater than 2, i is greater than 2, g is 0, kp is 2, v2 is greater than 1, prev is either 0 or n-1, v1 is 0, r is a string containing one character ('>', '=', or '<'), r2 is either '<' or an empty string, and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either 0 or n-1 and v1 is 0 is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? 0 0 [v2] [v2]" where v2 is greater than 1, and the standard output is flushed. If r is '<', then v1 is equal to v2 which is greater than 1, the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either 0 or n-1 and v1 is equal to v2 which is greater than 1 is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? 0 0 [v2] [v2]" where v2 is greater than 1, and the standard output is flushed.**
