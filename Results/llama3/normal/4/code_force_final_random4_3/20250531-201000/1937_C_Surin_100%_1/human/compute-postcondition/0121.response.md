Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is 2, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v2` is n-1, `v1` is n-1, `r` is a string containing one character ('>', '=', or '<'), `prev` is 2, and `r2` is a string read from the standard input.**

In this output state, the value of `prev` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
