The code prints a formatted string containing several variables. Let's break down the values of these variables based on the given initial state:

- `v1` is `n-1`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive).
- `i` is 2.
- `prev` depends on the value of `r`. Since the value of `r` is not explicitly given, we'll describe `prev` based on the conditions:
  - If `r` is '>', then `prev` is 1.
  - If `r` is '=', then `prev` is 1.
  - If `r` is '<', then `prev` remains unchanged, but since its initial value isn't explicitly defined for this case, we can't determine its exact value without knowing the initial value of `r`. However, based on the given conditions, if `r` is '<', `prev` would be 0 or remain unchanged from a previous value not specified in the initial state.

Given these conditions and the lack of an explicit value for `r`, we can't determine the exact value of `prev` without knowing the value of `r`. However, we can describe the output based on the given format.

Output: **? [n-1] 2 [n-1] [prev]** (where [n-1] represents the value of `v1` which is `n-1`, and [prev] represents the value of `prev` which depends on the value of `r` as described above)
