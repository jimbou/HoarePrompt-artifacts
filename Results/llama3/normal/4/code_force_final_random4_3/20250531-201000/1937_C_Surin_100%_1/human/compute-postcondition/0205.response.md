Postcondition: **n is greater than 2, i is increased by 1, g is 0, kp is 2, v2 is equal to n-1, r is either '>' or '=' or '<', and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either 0 or n-1 or i and v1 is equal to n-1 is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [i] [n-1] [prev]" and "? [i] [i] [prev] [prev]" and "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is equal to n-1 and prev is either 0 or n-1 or i depending on the value of r. If r is '=', then r2 is either '>' or '=' or '<'. If r2 is '<', then prev is equal to i and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is equal to i and v1 is equal to n-1 is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [i] [n-1] [prev]" where prev is equal to i. If r2 is not '<', then no changes are made to prev and the output is not flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is equal to n-1 and prev is either 0 or n-1 or i depending on the value of r. If r is '=', then i is increased by 2, and if r2 is '<', then prev is equal to i and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is equal to i and v1 is equal to n-1 is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [i] [n-1] [prev]" and "? [i] [i] [prev] [prev]" and "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is equal to n-1 and prev is equal to i depending on the value of r. If r2 is not '<', then no changes are made to prev and the output is not flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "?
