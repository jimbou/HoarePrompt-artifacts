Postcondition: ***n is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), i is 2, g is 0, kp is 0, v2 is n-1. If the user's response to the printed query "? [v1] [2] [v1] [prev]" is '>', then prev is 2. If the user's response is '=', then the user's response to the printed query "? 2 2 [prev] [prev]" is checked. If the response to the second query is '<', then prev is 2. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
