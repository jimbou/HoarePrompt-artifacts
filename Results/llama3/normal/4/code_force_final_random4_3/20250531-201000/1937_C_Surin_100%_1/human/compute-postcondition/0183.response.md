The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`. So `i` is increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i`. 
State: **n is greater than 1, i is less than n and i is increased by 1, g is 0, kp is 2, v2 is equal to n-1, and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either 0 or n-1 and v1 is equal to n-1 is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [i] [n-1] [prev]". If r is '>', then prev is equal to i. If r is not '>', then prev is equal to i if r is not '=', otherwise prev remains 0, and this is printed: ? [i] [i] [prev] [prev].**
