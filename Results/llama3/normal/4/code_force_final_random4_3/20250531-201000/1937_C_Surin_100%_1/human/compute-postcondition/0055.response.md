The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **n is an integer (3 <= n <= 10^3), i is 3, g is 0, kp is 0, v2 is n-1. If the user's response to the printed query "? [v1] [2] [v1] [prev]" is '>', then prev is 2. If the user's response is '=', then the user's response to the printed query "? 2 2 [prev] [prev]" is checked. If the response to the second query is '<', then prev is 2. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
