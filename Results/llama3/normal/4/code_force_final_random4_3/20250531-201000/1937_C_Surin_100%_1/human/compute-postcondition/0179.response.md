Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `n`, `g` is 0, `kp` is 2, `v2` is equal to `n-1`, `prev` is equal to `i`, `r` is a string containing one character ('='), `r2` is a string containing one character and its current value is '<', the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either 0 or n-1 and v1 is equal to n-1 is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [i] [n-1] [prev]", and this is printed: ? [i] [i] [prev] [prev]**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `prev` is updated to be equal to `i`, which is less than `n`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the previously printed outputs remain the same.
