Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `i` is less than `n` and has been increased by 1, so its current value is `i + 1`.
* `prev` is either 0, `n-1`, or `i`, depending on the value of `r`. Since `r` is either '>', '=' or '<', we can't determine the exact value of `prev` without knowing the value of `r`. However, we can describe its possible values.
* The print statement prints a formatted string with the values of `i`, `i`, `prev`, and `prev`.

Considering the possible values of `prev`, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **? [i+1] [i+1] [0 or n-1 or i+1] [0 or n-1 or i+1]**
