Output State: **n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), i is n, g is 0, kp is t-1, v2 is n-1, prev is either 0 or n-1 or i, v1 is n-1, r is a string containing one character ('>', '=', or '<'), r2 is either '<' or an empty string, and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either 0 or n-1 or i and v1 is n-1 is flushed to the standard output.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing for all t inputs, and the final state of the variables is as follows: n is an integer between 1 and 10^3, i is equal to n, g is 0, kp is one less than the total number of inputs t, v2 is one less than n, prev is either 0, n-1, or i, v1 is n-1, r is a string containing one character ('>', '=', or '<'), r2 is either '<' or an empty string, and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either 0, n-1, or i and v1 is n-1 is flushed to the standard output.
