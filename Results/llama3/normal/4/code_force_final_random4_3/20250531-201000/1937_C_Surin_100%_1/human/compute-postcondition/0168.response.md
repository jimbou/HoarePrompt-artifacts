The code prints a formatted string containing several variables. The variables are `v1`, `i`, and `prev`. 

`v1` is equal to `n-1`. Since `n` is greater than 1, `v1` will be at least 0.

`i` is less than `n`, so its value will be less than `n`.

`prev` is either 0 or `n-1`. 

The output will be a string in the format '? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]', where [v1] is equal to `n-1`, [i] is less than `n`, and [prev] is either 0 or `n-1`.

Output: **? [n-1] [a value less than n] [n-1] [either 0 or n-1]**
