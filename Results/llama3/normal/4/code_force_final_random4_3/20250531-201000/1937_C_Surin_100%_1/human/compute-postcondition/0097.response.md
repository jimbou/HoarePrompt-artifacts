To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`. Therefore, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is 1, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `r` is either '>' or '=' or '<', and the output "! [prev] [v1]" has been printed to the console and flushed.**
