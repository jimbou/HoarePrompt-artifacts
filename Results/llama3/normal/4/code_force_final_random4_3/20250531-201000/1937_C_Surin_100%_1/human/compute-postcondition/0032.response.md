Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), `i` is 1, `g` is 0, `kp` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is '>', `prev` is 1, stdin contains `t-n-1` inputs: an integer (n) (2 <= n <= 10^4). The current value of `r` is '>', and the values of `v1` and the printed string are determined by the previous value of `r`, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where [v1] is the value of `v1`, [i] is 1, [prev] is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `prev` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The printed string still depends on the previous value of `r`, which is '>', and the values of `v1` and `prev` have been updated accordingly.
