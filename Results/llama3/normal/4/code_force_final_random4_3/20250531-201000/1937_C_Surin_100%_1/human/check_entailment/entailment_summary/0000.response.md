Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It uses a binary search approach to find the maximum and second maximum elements in the sequence. The program first finds the maximum element by comparing each element with the current maximum. Once the maximum element is found, it then finds the second maximum element by comparing each element with the current second maximum. The program uses the bitwise OR operation to compare elements, which is a valid approach for this problem. The program also ensures that it does not exceed the maximum allowed number of queries (3n) and correctly outputs the indices of the maximum and second maximum elements in the required format.

Correctness: **True**
