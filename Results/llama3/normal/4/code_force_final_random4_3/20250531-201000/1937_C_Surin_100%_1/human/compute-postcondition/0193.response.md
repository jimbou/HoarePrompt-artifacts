Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `n` and `i` is increased by 1, `g` is 0, `kp` is 2, `v2` is equal to `n-1`, `r` is either '>' or '=' or '<', and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is either 0 or `n-1` or `i` and `v1` is equal to `n-1` is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [i] [n-1] [prev]". If `r` is '>', then `prev` is equal to `i`. If `r` is not '>', then `prev` is equal to `i` if `r` is not '=', otherwise `prev` remains 0, and this is printed: ? [i] [i] [prev] [prev]. The following is printed: ? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev] where `v1` is equal to `n-1` and `prev` is either 0 or `n-1` or `i` depending on the value of `r`. If `r` is '=', then `r2` is either '>' or '=' or '<'. If `r2` is '<', then `prev` is equal to `i` and the output "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is equal to `i` and `v1` is equal to `n-1` is flushed to the standard output, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [i] [n-1] [prev]" where `prev` is equal to `i`. If `r2` is not '<', then no changes are made to `prev` and the output is not flushed to the standard output.**
