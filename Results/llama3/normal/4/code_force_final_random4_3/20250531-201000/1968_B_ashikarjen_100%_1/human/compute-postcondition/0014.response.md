The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` with its first character different from the first character of `a`. If `j` is less than `m`, then `k` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `i` is 1, with t-2 test cases remaining in stdin. Otherwise, `k` is 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, with t-1 test case remaining in stdin.**
