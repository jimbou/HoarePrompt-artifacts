Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` with its first character different from the first character of `a`, `i` is 1. If `j` is less than `m`, then `j` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 1 such that `b[j]` is equal to `a[i]` or `j` is equal to `m` plus 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is equal to `m`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `k` is 1.***
