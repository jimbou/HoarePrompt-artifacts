Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` with its first character different from the first character of `a`. If `j` is less than `m`, then `j` is incremented by 1 and `k` is also incremented by 1, and `b` still has at least `m-1` characters that are different from `a[i]`. If `j` is not less than `m`, then the loop or if statement is exited.***
