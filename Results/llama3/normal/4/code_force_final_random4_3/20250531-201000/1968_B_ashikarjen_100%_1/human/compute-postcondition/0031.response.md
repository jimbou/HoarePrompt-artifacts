Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` with its first character different from the first character of `a` and `b[j]` is different from `a[i]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `k` is 1**

The code increments the value of `j` by 1, so the new value of `j` is 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
