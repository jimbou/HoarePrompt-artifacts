Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` with its first character different from the first character of `a`. If `j` is less than `m`, then `k` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `i` is 0, with t-2 test cases remaining in stdin. Otherwise, `k` is 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, with t-1 test case remaining in stdin.***
