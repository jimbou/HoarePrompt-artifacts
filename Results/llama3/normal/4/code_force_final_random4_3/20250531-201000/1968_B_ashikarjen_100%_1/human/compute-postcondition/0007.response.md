Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` with its first character different from the first character of `a` and the jth character of `b` is different from the first character of `b`, `k` is 0, `j` is less than `m` and increased by 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but it is still less than `m`. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
