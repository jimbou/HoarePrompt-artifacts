Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the number of times a character in a binary string `a` is found in another binary string `b`. It accepts no parameters and returns nothing, only printing the result to the console. The function iterates through each character in `a` and checks if it exists in `b`, incrementing a counter `k` each time a match is found. The function concludes by printing the value of `k`, which represents the total number of matches found.**
