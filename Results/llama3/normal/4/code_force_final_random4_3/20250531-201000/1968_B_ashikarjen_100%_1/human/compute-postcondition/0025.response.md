Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` with its first character different from the first character of `a`, `j` is equal to `m`, and `b` has at least `m-1` characters that are different from `a[i]`. Additionally, `j` is greater than or equal to `m`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values and properties, but the program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
