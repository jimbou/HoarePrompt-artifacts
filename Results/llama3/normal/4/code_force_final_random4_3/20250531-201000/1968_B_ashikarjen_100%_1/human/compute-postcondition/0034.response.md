Output State: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` with its first character different from the first character of `a`, `i` is 1, `j` is `m` if `b[m-1]` is different from `a[i]`, otherwise `j` is the index of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in `b`, `k` is 1.

This output state means that after the loop finishes executing, the value of `j` will be either `m` (if the last character of `b` is different from the first character of `a`) or the index of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in `b` (if `b` contains `a[i]`). The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged.
