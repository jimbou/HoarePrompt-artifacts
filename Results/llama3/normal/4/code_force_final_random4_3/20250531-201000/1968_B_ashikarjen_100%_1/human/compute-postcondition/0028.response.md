To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved accordingly. The loop head is `while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:`.

1. **Condition `j < m`**: For this condition to be true, since `j` is 1 and `m` is an integer greater than 0, we need to ensure that `m` is greater than 1 because `j` is already at its minimum value (1) to satisfy the condition. Thus, `m` must be at least 2.

2. **Condition `b[j] != a[i]`**: Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, and knowing that the first character of `b` is different from the first character of `a`, this condition is already satisfied by the initial states of `a` and `b`. No adjustment is needed here.

Given these considerations, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `m` is greater than 1, which means `m` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` with its first character different from the first character of `a`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1**
