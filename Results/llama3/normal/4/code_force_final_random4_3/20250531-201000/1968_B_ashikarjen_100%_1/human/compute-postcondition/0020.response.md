Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` with its first character different from the first character of `a`, `j` is less than `m` and greater than its previous value by 1, and `b` has at least two more characters that are different from `a[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `j` has been incremented by 1, but it is still less than `m`. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The condition that `b` has at least two more characters different from `a[i]` is still valid.
