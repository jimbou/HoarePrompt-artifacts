Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `k` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m. The second line contains a binary string a of length n. The third line contains a binary string b of length m.
Code of the loop:
while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
    j += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` with its first character different from the first character of `a`, `k` is 0, `j` is 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` with its first character different from the first character of `a`, `k` is 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` with its first character different from the first character of `a` and the jth character of `b` is different from the first character of `b`, `k` is 0, `j` is less than `m` and increased by 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
