The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `j` is 1, so the new value of `j` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` with its first character different from the first character of `a`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 1**
