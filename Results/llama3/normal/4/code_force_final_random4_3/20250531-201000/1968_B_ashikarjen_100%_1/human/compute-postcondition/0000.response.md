Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length m, k is 0, j is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m. The second line contains a binary string a of length n. The third line contains a binary string b of length m.**

The code reads the first test case from stdin, assigning the values of n and m from the first line, and the binary strings a and b from the second and third lines, respectively. The variables k and j are initialized to 0. The remaining test cases are still in stdin, waiting to be processed.
