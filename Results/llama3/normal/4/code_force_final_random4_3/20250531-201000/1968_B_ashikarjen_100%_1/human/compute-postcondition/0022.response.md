Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` with its first character different from the first character of `a`, `j` was equal to `m`, and `b` has at least `m-1` characters that are different from `a[i]`. The current value of `j` is less than `m`.***
