Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` with its first character different from the first character of `a`, `k` is 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `k`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
