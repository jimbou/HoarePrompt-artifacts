Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` with its first character different from the first character of `a`, and `j` is less than or equal to `m`**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either equal to `m` or still less than `m`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
