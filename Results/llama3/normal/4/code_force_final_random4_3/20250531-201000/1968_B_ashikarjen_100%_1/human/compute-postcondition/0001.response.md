To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is an integer and `i` is the loop variable, we need to adjust their states accordingly.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `k` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m. The second line contains a binary string a of length n. The third line contains a binary string b of length m.**
