Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` with its first character different from the first character of `a`, `k` is 0, `j` is 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
