The code snippet appends two elements to the `pattern` list based on the value of `i`. The first line appends 'A' if `i` is even (since `i % 2` would be 0) and 'B' if `i` is odd (since `i % 2` would be 1). The second line appends the opposite of what the first line appends, due to the XOR operation (`^ 1`).

Since `i` is 0, which is even, the first line appends 'A' to `pattern`, making it `['A']`. The second line then appends 'B' to `pattern` because of the XOR operation, making it `['A', 'B']`.

No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the final state remains the same for all other variables.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), n is an even integer at least 2 and at most 50 (inclusive), _ is 0, stdin contains no input, 'YES' is being printed, pattern is ['A', 'B'], i is 0**
