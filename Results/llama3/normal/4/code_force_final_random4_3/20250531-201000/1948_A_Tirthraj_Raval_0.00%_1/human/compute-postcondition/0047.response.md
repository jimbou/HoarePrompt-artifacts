Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer that must be at least 3, _ is 2, pattern is ['A', 'B', 'B', 'A'], i is 1**

The code appends two elements to the `pattern` list. The first line appends 'AB'[i % 2], which is 'B' since i is 1. The second line appends 'AB'[i % 2 ^ 1], which is 'A' since i is 1. The values of t, n, _, and i remain unchanged.
