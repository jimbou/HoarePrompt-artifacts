Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `_` is 1, stdin contains no input. If `n` is an odd number, 'NO' is being printed. If `n` is an even number, 'YES' is being printed, pattern is a list of 'A's and 'B's with a length of `n`, `i` is `n // 2 - 1`, and a string of 'A's and 'B's with a length of `n` is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to an integer, which is the input from the user. The other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state. Note that the value of `n` is no longer restricted to be between 1 and 50 (inclusive), as it can now be any integer input by the user.
