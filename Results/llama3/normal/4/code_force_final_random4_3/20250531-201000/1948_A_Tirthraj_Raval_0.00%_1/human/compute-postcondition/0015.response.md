Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), n is an even integer at least 6 and at most 50 (inclusive), _ is 0, 'YES' is being printed, pattern is ['A', 'B', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A'], i is 2**

The code appends two elements to the pattern list. The first line appends 'AB'[i % 2], which is 'B' since i is 2 and 2 % 2 is 0. The second line appends 'AB'[i % 2 ^ 1], which is 'A' since i is 2 and 2 % 2 ^ 1 is 1. The values of t, n, _, and the printed 'YES' remain unchanged.
