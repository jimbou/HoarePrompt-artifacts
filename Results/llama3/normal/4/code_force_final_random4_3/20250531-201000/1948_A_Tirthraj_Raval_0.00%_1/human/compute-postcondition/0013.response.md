Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), n is an even integer at least 4 and at most 50 (inclusive), _ is 0, 'YES' is being printed, pattern is ['A', 'B', 'B', 'A'], i is 1**

Explanation: The code snippet modifies the `pattern` list by appending two new elements. The first line appends the character at index `i % 2` from the string 'AB', which is 'B' since `i` is 1. The second line appends the character at index `i % 2 ^ 1` from the string 'AB', which is 'A' since `i` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
