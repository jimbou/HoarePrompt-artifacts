Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `_` is 2, stdin contains no input. If `n` is an odd number, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is an even number, 'YES' is printed, `pattern` is an empty list, `i` is `n // 2 - 1`, and a string of 'A's and 'B's with a length of `n` is printed. The string contains alternating 'A's and 'B's if `n` is even, otherwise 'NO' is printed, and 'YES' is printed**

In this output state, the value of `pattern` has been changed to an empty list. The other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
