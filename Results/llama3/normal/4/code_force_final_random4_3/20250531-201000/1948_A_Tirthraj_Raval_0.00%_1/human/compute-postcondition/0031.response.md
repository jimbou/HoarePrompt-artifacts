The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n // 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to 5.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 5, `_` is 1, `pattern` is a list containing four characters, the first two characters are 'A' if i is even and 'B' if i is odd, the second two characters are 'B' if i is odd and 'A' if i is even, `i` is 2**
