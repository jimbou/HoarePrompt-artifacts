This function reads an integer `t` from standard input, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it reads another integer `n`. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, it prints 'YES' and then generates a string of alternating 'A's and 'B's of length `n`, which it also prints. The function repeats this process `t` times, consuming all input from standard input.
