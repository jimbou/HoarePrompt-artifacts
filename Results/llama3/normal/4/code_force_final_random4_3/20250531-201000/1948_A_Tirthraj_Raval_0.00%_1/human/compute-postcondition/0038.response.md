Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `_` is 2, stdin contains no input. If `n` is an odd number, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is an even number, 'YES' is printed, pattern is a list of 'A's and 'B's with a length of `n`, `i` is `n // 2 - 1`, and a string of 'A's and 'B's with a length of `n` is printed. The string contains alternating 'A's and 'B's if `n` is even, otherwise 'NO' is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to an integer, which was previously unknown. The other variables, `t`, `_`, and the contents of stdin, remain unchanged. The conditions for printing 'NO' or 'YES', the length and composition of the pattern list, the value of `i`, and the printed string of 'A's and 'B's are all still dependent on the value of `n`.
