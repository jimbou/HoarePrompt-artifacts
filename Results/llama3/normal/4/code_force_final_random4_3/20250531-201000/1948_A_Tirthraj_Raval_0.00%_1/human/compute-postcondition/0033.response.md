Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer, _ is 1, pattern is a list containing n characters, the characters in the list alternate between 'A' and 'B', i is n // 2 - 1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` remains an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `n` remains an integer, `_` remains 1, `pattern` becomes a list containing `n` characters, where the characters alternate between 'A' and 'B', and `i` becomes `n // 2 - 1`.
