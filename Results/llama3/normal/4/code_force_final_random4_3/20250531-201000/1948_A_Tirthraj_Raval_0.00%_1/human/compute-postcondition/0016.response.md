Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), n is an even integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), _ is 0, stdin contains no input, 'YES' is being printed, pattern is a list of 'A's and 'B's with a length of n, i is n // 2 - 1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` remains an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `n` remains an even integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `_` remains 0, stdin contains no input, 'YES' is still being printed, `pattern` becomes a list of 'A's and 'B's with a length of `n`, and `i` becomes `n // 2 - 1`.
