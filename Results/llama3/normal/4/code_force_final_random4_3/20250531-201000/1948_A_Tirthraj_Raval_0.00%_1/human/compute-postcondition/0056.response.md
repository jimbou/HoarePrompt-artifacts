Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 49 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `_` is `t`, stdin contains no input. If `n` is an odd number, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is an even number, 'YES' is printed, pattern is a list of 'A's and 'B's with a length of `n`, `i` is `n // 2 - 1`, and a string of 'A's and 'B's with a length of `n` is printed. The string contains alternating 'A's and 'B's if `n` is even, otherwise 'NO' is printed. If `n` is at least 50, pattern is a list of 'A's and 'B's with a length of `n`.**

This output state indicates that the loop has finished executing all its iterations. The variable `t` has been decremented to 0, indicating that the loop has run `t` times. The variable `n` still holds the last input value, and the variable `_` has been incremented to `t`, indicating the number of iterations completed. The stdin is empty, as all inputs have been processed. The output state also reflects the final values of the variables `pattern` and `i`, which are used to generate the output string. If the last input `n` is even, the output string contains alternating 'A's and 'B's; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
