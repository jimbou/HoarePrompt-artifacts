The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input, which is an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 50), to the variable `t`. The stdin now contains one input: `t` integers (1 <= n <= 50). The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains one input: `t` integers (1 <= n <= 50)**
