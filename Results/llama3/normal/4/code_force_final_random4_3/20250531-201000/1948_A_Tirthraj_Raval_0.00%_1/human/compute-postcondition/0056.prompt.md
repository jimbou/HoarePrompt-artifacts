Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains one input: `t` integers (1 <= n <= 50)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    if n % 2 == 1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        pattern = []
        for i in range(n // 2):
            pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
            pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
        print(''.join(pattern))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `_` is 0, stdin contains no input. If `n` is an odd number, 'NO' is being printed. If `n` is an even number, 'YES' is being printed, pattern is a list of 'A's and 'B's with a length of `n`, `i` is `n // 2 - 1`, and a string of 'A's and 'B's with a length of `n` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `_` is 1, stdin contains no input. If `n` is an odd number, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is an even number, 'YES' is printed, pattern is a list of 'A's and 'B's with a length of `n`, `i` is `n // 2 - 1`, and a string of 'A's and 'B's with a length of `n` is printed. The string contains alternating 'A's and 'B's if `n` is even, otherwise 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer. If n is an odd number, 'NO' is printed. If n is an even number, 'YES' is printed, pattern is a list of 'A's and 'B's with a length of n, i is n // 2 - 1, and a string of 'A's and 'B's with a length of n is printed. The string contains alternating 'A's and 'B's if n is even, otherwise 'NO' is printed. If n is at least 50, pattern is a list of 'A's and 'B's with a length of n.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
