To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n // 2` is greater than 0, meaning `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 1, `pattern` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
