Based on the precondition, the value of `n` determines what is printed. If `n` is an odd number, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is an even number, 'YES' is printed, but in this case, the print statement is simply 'NO', regardless of the value of `n`. Therefore, the output will always be 'NO', regardless of whether `n` is odd or even.

Output: **NO**
