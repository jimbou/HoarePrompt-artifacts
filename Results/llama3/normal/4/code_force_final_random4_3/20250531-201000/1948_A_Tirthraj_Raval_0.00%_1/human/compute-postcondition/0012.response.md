To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(n // 2):`. The objects involved are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an even integer at least 2 and at most 50 (inclusive).

To adjust the states for the loop to execute again, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `n` is an even integer, `n // 2` will be an integer. For the loop to execute again, `n // 2` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an even integer at least 4 and at most 50 (inclusive), `_` is 0, stdin contains no input, 'YES' is being printed, pattern is ['A', 'B'], `i` is 1**
