Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an even integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `_` is 0, stdin contains no input, 'YES' is being printed, and `pattern` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains no input. The condition that `n` is even is still valid. 'YES' is still being printed. The only change is that a new variable `pattern` is introduced and assigned an empty list.
