Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer. If n is an odd number, 'NO' is printed. If n is an even number, 'YES' is printed, pattern is a list of 'A's and 'B's with a length of n, i is n // 2 - 1, and a string of 'A's and 'B's with a length of n is printed. The string contains alternating 'A's and 'B's if n is even, otherwise 'NO' is printed. If n is at least 50, pattern is a list of 'A's and 'B's with a length of n.**
