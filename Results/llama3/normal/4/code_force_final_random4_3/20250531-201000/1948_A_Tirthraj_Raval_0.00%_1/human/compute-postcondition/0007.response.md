The code prints the string 'YES'. The variables `t`, `n`, and `_` are not used in the print statement, so their values do not affect the output. The fact that `n` is even and `t` and `n` are within certain ranges also does not impact the output, as these conditions do not influence the print statement.

Output: **YES**
