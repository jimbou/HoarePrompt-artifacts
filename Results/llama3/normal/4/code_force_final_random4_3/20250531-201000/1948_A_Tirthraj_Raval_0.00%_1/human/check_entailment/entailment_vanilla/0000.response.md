Reasoning:

1. The problem requires building a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

2. The given program defines a function `func()` that takes the number of test cases `t` as input and then iterates over each test case.

3. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` as input and checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to create a string with an odd number of special characters.

4. If `n` is even, it prints 'YES' and then generates a pattern of 'A's and 'B's. The pattern is created by alternating between 'A' and 'B' for `n // 2` pairs.

5. The generated pattern is then joined into a string and printed.

6. The program does not handle invalid inputs or edge cases, but based on the problem description, it is assumed that the inputs are valid.

7. The program does not check if the generated string has exactly `n` special characters, but based on the pattern generation logic, it can be inferred that the string will have `n` special characters.

8. The program does not check if the generated string is of length at most 200, but based on the problem description, it is assumed that the string will be of length at most 200.

9. The program does not handle multiple solutions, but based on the problem description, it is assumed that any solution is acceptable.

10. Based on the above analysis, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
