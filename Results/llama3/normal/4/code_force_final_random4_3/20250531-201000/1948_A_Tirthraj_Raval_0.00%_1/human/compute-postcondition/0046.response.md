To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is at least 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. Since `n` is at least 2, `n // 2` is at least 1. Therefore, `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `_` is 2, `pattern` is ['A', 'B'], `i` is 1**
