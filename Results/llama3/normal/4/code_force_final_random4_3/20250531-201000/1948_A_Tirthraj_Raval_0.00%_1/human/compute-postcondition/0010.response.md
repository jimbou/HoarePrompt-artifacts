To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 2 (since `n` is even), the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an even integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), but this does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an even integer at least 2 and at most 50 (inclusive), `_` is 0, stdin contains no input, 'YES' is being printed, `pattern` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
