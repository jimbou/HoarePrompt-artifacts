The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `_` is 2, stdin contains no input. If `n` is an odd number, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is an even number, 'YES' is printed, pattern is a list of 'A's and 'B's with a length of `n`, `i` is `n // 2 - 1`, and a string of 'A's and 'B's with a length of `n` is printed. The string contains alternating 'A's and 'B's if `n` is even, otherwise 'NO' is printed.**
