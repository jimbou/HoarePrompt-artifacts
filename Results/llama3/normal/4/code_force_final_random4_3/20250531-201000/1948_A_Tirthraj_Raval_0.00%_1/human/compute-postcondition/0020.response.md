To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0 and `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `_` is 1, stdin contains no input. If `n` is an odd number, 'NO' is being printed. If `n` is an even number, 'YES' is being printed, pattern is a list of 'A's and 'B's with a length of `n`, `i` is `n // 2 - 1`, and a string of 'A's and 'B's with a length of `n` is being printed.**
