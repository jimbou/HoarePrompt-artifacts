The code prints the concatenation of all elements in the `pattern` list.
Since the `pattern` list contains 250 'A's and 'B's, the print statement will output a string of 250 characters, consisting of 'A's and 'B's.
Output: **a string of 250 'A's and 'B's (where 'A's and 'B's are the elements of the pattern list)**
