The code snippet consists of two lines that append elements to the `pattern` list based on the value of `i`. The first line appends the character at index `i % 2` from the string `'AB'`, and the second line appends the character at index `i % 2 ^ 1` from the same string.

Since `i` is 0, `i % 2` is 0, and `i % 2 ^ 1` is 1. Therefore, the first line appends the character `'A'` to `pattern`, and the second line appends the character `'B'`.

After the execution of the code, the `pattern` list contains two elements: `'A'` and `'B'`. The values of `t`, `n`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer that must be at least 2, _ is 2, pattern is ['A', 'B'], i is 0**
