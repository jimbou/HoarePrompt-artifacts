To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(n // 2):`. The objects involved are `i` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.

Since `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n // 2` will be at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `n // 2` must be greater than 1, so `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

The other variables `t`, `_`, and `pattern` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `_` is 1, `pattern` is a list containing two characters, the first character is 'B' if `i` is odd and 'A' if `i` is even, the second character is 'A' if `i` is odd and 'B' if `i` is even, `i` is 1**
