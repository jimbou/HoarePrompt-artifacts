Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `_` is 1, `pattern` is an empty list, if `n` is an odd number, 'NO' is being printed. If `n` is an even number, 'YES' is being printed, `i` is `n // 2 - 1`, and a string of 'A's and 'B's with a length of `n` is being printed, and 'YES' is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n // 2):
    pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
    pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, _ is 1, pattern is a list containing two characters, the first character is 'A' if i is even and 'B' if i is odd, the second character is 'B' if i is even and 'A' if i is odd, i is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than or equal to 4, _ is 1, pattern is a list containing four characters, the first two characters are 'B' if i is odd and 'A' if i is even, the second two characters are 'A' if i is odd and 'B' if i is even, i is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than or equal to 5, _ is 1, pattern is a list containing six characters, the first two characters are 'A' if i is even and 'B' if i is odd, the second two characters are 'B' if i is odd and 'A' if i is even, the last two characters are 'A' and 'B' respectively, i is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
