Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when n is 2. According to the problem description, there must be exactly n special characters in the string, and a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. However, the program prints "MM" for n = 2, which has 2 special characters, but the string "MM" has 2 special characters at positions 1 and 2, not exactly one of its neighbors.

The program should print a string with exactly 2 special characters, for example, "ABA" or "ACA", but not "MM".
