The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n // 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an even integer at least 4 and at most 50 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be at least 6 so that `n // 2` is at least 3.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), n is an even integer at least 6 and at most 50 (inclusive), _ is 0, 'YES' is being printed, pattern is ['A', 'B', 'B', 'A'], i is 2**
