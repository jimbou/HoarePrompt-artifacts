The code prints the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`. 

`ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a` plus the sum of the first `k` integers in `a`. 

`ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`. 

Since `k` is 0, the sum of the first `k` integers in `a` is 0. Therefore, `ans1` is equal to `ans2`. 

The value of `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, which is equal to `ans1` (or `ans2`) because `ans1` is equal to `ans2`.

Output: **the sum of the integers in a minus four times the sum of the first x integers in a**
