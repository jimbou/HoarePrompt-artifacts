Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 2, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a` plus `a[0]` plus `a[i]` plus `a[i]`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 2, and `ans` is printed, where `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is updated by subtracting 2 times the value of `a[i+x]`.***
