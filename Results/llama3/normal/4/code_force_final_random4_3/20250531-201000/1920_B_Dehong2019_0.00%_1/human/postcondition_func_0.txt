This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: the number of elements, a threshold value, and a penalty value. The second line contains a list of integers. The function then calculates the maximum possible sum of the integers in the list, considering the penalty value and the threshold value, and prints the result for each test case. The function processes all test cases and does not return any value.
