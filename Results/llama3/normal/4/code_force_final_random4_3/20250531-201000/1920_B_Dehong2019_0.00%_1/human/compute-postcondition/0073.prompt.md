Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is `k-1`, and `ans` is printed, where `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    ans1 -= a[i] * 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a` minus twice the value of the integer at index `i` in `a`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 0, and `ans` is printed, where `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
