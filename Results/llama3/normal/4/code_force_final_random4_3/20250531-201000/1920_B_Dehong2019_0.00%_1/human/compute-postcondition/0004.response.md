Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the first integer in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been updated to be the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the first integer in `a`, since `a[i]` is the first integer in `a` and `i` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
