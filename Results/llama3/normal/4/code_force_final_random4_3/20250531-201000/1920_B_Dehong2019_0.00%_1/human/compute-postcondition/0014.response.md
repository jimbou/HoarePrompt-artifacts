Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x+2` integers in `a`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 0. The current value of `i` plus `x` is less than `n`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans1` has been updated by subtracting twice the value of the integer at index `i + x` in list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 0, and the current value of `i` plus `x` is still less than `n`.
