Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x+2` integers in `a` if `i+x+1` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x+1` integers in `a`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been updated by adding the integer at index `i` in list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans1` now depends on whether `i+x+1` is less than `n` or not. If it is, then `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x+2` integers in `a`. Otherwise, it remains the same as before. The value of `ans` is still the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
