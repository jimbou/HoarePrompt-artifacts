To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer equal to the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. So for the loop to be executed, `t` must be greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
