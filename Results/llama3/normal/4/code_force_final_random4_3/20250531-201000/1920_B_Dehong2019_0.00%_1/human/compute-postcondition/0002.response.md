Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, ans1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**

The first line reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to `n`, `k`, and `x`, respectively. The second line reads a list of integers from stdin, sorts them in descending order, and assigns the result to `a`. The third line calculates the sum of the integers in `a` and assigns the result to `ans1`. The value of `t` and `_` remains unchanged. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two.
