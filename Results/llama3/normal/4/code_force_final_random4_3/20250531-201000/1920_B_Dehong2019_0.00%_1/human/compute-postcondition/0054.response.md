Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 2, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 2, `ans` is printed. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x+1` integers in `a` minus twice the value of the integer at index `i+x` in `a` plus the value of the integer at index `i` in `a` minus twice the value of the integer at index `i+x` in `a` plus the value of the integer at index `i` in `a` minus twice the value of the integer at index `i+x` in `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `ans1` has been updated by subtracting twice the value of the integer at index `i+x` in `a`. This means that `ans1` now takes into account the value of the integer at index `i+x` in `a` and has been adjusted accordingly. All other variables remain unchanged.
