Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the first integer in `a` minus twice the second integer in `a` minus twice the third integer in `a`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been updated by subtracting twice the third integer in `a` from its previous value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
