To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `k` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x+1` integers in `a` if `i+x` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x+1` integers in `a`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 1**
