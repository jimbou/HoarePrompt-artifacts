Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is `x-1`, and `ans` is printed, where `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that `ans2` is now equal to `ans1`. The values of all other variables remain the same, and the program state remains unchanged except for the updated value of `ans2`.
