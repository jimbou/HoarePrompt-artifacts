Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is `x-1`, and `ans` is printed, where `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `ans1` has been updated to be the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`, and `i` has reached `x-1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
