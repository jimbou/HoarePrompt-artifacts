Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x+1` integers in `a`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 0, and `ans` is printed, where `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`. The current value of `i` plus `x` is less than `n`.**
