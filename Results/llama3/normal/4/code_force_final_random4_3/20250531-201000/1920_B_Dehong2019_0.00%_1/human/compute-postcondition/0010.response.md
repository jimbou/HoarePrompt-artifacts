Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is `x-1`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans2` is assigned the value of `ans1`, which is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
