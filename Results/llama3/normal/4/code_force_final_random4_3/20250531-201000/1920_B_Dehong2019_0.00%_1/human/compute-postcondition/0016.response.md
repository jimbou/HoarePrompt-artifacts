Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x+1` integers in `a` if `i+x` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x+1` integers in `a`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, which are calculated based on the values of `a`, `x`, `n`, and `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` will be either `ans1` or `ans2`, whichever is greater.
