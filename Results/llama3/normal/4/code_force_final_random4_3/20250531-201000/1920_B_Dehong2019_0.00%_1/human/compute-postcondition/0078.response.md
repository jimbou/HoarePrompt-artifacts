Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a` plus `a[0]` minus 2 times the value of `a[i+x]`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 0, and `ans` is printed, where `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, and the current value of `i` plus `x` is less than `n`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans1` has been updated by subtracting twice the value of the element at index `i+x` in list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 0, and the current value of `i` plus `x` is still less than `n`. The list `a` is still in descending order, and `ans` is still the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`. The input stream `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus two.
