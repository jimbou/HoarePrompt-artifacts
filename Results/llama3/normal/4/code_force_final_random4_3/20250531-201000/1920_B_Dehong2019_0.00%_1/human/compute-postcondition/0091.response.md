Output State: `t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is 0, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a` plus the sum of the first `k` integers in `a`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is `k-1`, and `ans` is printed, where `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is updated by subtracting 2 times the value of `a[i+x]`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `x`, `a`, and `ans2` remain unchanged.
- The variable `k` becomes 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
- The variable `ans1` is updated to include the sum of the first `k` integers in `a`, which is 0 since `k` is 0.
- The variable `ans` is updated to be the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
- The variable `i` is updated to be `k-1`, which is -1 since `k` is 0.
- The value of `ans` is printed.

Note that the condition `if i + x < n` is not applicable when `i` is -1, so `ans1` is not updated by subtracting 2 times the value of `a[i+x]`.
