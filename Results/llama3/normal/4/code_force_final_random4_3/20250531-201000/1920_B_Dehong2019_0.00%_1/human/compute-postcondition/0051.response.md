Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 1, `ans` is printed. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x+1` integers in `a` minus twice the value of the integer at index `i+x` in `a` plus the value of the integer at index `i` in `a` minus twice the value of the integer at index `i+x` in `a`.**

The code updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The value of `ans` is now the maximum of the two possible values, which depends on the condition `i + x` being less than `n`.
