Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case, `_` is the result of `int(input())`, `i` is 1, `b` is a string that was inputted from stdin. If `b` contains the digit '1', `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b`. Otherwise, `k` remains an empty list.***
