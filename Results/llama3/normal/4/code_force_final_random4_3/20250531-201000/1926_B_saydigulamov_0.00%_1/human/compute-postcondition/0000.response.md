The code `a = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `a`. Since the initial state specifies that the standard input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) followed by `t` test cases, the first input read by the code is the value of `t`.

Therefore, the value of `a` is assigned the value of `t`, which is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

The output state is: `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains `a` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10) followed by `n` lines, each containing a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid. The size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.
