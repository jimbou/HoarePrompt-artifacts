To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved are `_` and the input from `stdin`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `_` is the result of `int(input())`, which means it's an integer value read from `stdin`. We also know that `stdin` contains at least 1 test case.

For the loop to execute again, we need to consider the following:

* `_` is the result of `int(input())`, so it will be a new integer value read from `stdin`.
* `stdin` must contain at least 1 more test case for the loop to execute again.

We can't adjust the state of `a`, `i`, `b`, or `k` because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 1, stdin contains at least 1 more test case, `_` is the result of `int(input())` (a new integer value), `i` is 1, `b` is a string that was inputted from stdin, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` (if `b` contains the digit '1') or an empty list (if `b` does not contain the digit '1')**
