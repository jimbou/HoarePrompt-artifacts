Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `stdin` contains `a-6` test cases if '1' is in the previous value of `b`, otherwise `a-5` test cases, `_` is 2, `i` is 0, `b` is a string that was inputted from stdin, if '1' is in the previous value of `b`, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in the previous string `b` repeated three times, otherwise `k` is a list containing two zeros**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to include the count of '1' in the previous string `b` one more time. If '1' was in the previous value of `b`, `k` now contains the count of '1' in `b` repeated three times. If '1' was not in the previous value of `b`, `k` now contains two zeros. The values of the other variables remain the same.
