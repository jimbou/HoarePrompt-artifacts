The code `k.append(b.count('1'))` appends the count of the character '1' in the string `b` to the list `k`. Since `b` contains the character '1', the count of '1' is at least 1.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 0, stdin contains `a-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, `k` is a list containing at least one integer (the count of '1' in string `b`), `b` is a string that contains the character '1'**
