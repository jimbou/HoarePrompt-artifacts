Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 0, stdin contains `a-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, `b` is a string. If `b` contains the character '1', `k` is a list containing at least one integer (the count of '1' in string `b`). Otherwise, `k` is an empty list.***
