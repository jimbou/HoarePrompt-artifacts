Output State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 1, stdin contains at least 1 more test case, `_` is the result of `int(input())` (a new integer value), `i` is 1, `b` is a string that was inputted from stdin, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` (if `b` contains the digit '1') or an empty list (if `b` does not contain the digit '1')**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to a new string input from stdin, and the value of `k` is determined based on the presence of the digit '1' in the new string `b`. The values of `a`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged.
