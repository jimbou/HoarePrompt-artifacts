Reasoning: The given program is not correct. The program only checks if the count of '1's in the first and second rows are equal, and if so, it prints the list `k`. However, this is not sufficient to determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle. The program does not check the counts of '1's in the subsequent rows, nor does it check the positions of the '1's in the rows. It also does not handle the case where the shape is a triangle.

Correctness: **False**
