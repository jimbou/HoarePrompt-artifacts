The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a grid of '0's and '1's. It counts the number of '1's in each row of the grid and stores these counts in a list. If the first two rows have the same count of '1's, it prints the list of counts. The function processes all test cases in this manner, ultimately consuming all input from standard input.
