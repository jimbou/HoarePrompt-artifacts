The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and `input()`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `input()`. If `input()` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `a` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 2, stdin contains 0 test cases, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, `b` is an empty string, `k` is an empty list does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `input()` is greater than 0 and `_` is 0. 
State: **`a` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, `b` is an empty string, `k` is an empty list**
