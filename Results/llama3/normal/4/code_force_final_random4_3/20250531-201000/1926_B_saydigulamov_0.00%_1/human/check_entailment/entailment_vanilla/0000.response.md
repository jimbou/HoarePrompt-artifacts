Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. Here's why:

1. The program does not correctly identify whether the shape is a triangle or a square. It only checks if the first two rows have the same number of '1's, which is not a sufficient condition to determine the shape.

2. The program does not handle the case where the shape is a triangle. It only checks for squares and does not have any logic to identify triangles.

3. The program prints the number of '1's in the first two rows if they are equal, but it does not print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required by the problem.

4. The program does not handle the case where the input grid does not contain any '1's.

5. The program does not handle the case where the input grid contains multiple shapes.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to analyze the pattern of '1's in the grid and determine whether it forms a triangle or a square. We can do this by checking the number of '1's in each row and their positions.

Here is a correct solution:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        shape = "TRIANGLE"
        for j in range(n):
            count = grid[j].count('1')
            if count != n - j and count != j + 1:
                shape = "SQUARE"
                break
        print(shape)

func()
```

This solution correctly identifies whether the shape is a triangle or a square by analyzing the pattern of '1's in the grid.

Correctness: **False**
