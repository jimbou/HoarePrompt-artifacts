Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `stdin` contains `a-3` test cases, `_` is 1, `i` is 0, `b` is a string that was inputted from stdin, if `b` contains the character '1', `k` is a list containing at least one integer (the count of '1' in string `b`). Otherwise, `k` is an empty list.**

The value of `b` is updated to be the string inputted from stdin. The count of test cases in stdin is decreased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
