Postcondition: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 1, stdin contains at least 1 more test case, `_` is the result of `int(input())` (a new integer value), `i` is 1, `b` is a new string that was inputted from stdin, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` (if `b` contains the digit '1') or an empty list (if `b` does not contain the digit '1'). If '1' is in `b`, then the count of '1' in string `b` is either 0 (if `b` does not contain the digit '1') or a positive integer (if `b` contains the digit '1'). If '1' is not in `b`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
