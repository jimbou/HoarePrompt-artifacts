Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 0, stdin contains `a-1` test cases, `int(input())` is equal to `a`, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, `k` is an empty list, `b` is a string**

In this output state, the value of `a` remains the same, which is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 0. The stdin contains `a-1` test cases because one test case has been consumed by the `input()` function. The value of `_` is still 0, and the value of `i` is still 0. The list `k` is still empty. The new variable `b` is assigned the value of the input string, which is a string.
