Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than or equal to the number of times the loop executed, stdin contains 0 test cases, `_` is equal to the number of test cases, `i` is equal to the number of times the loop executed minus 1, `b` is a string representing the last test case, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in each test case. If the count of '1' in the first test case is equal to the count of '1' in the second test case, the list `k` is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `a` will be equal to or greater than the number of times the loop executed, the standard input will be empty (containing 0 test cases), the variable `_` will be equal to the number of test cases, the variable `i` will be one less than the number of times the loop executed, the variable `b` will be the last test case inputted, and the variable `k` will be a list containing the count of '1' in each test case. If the count of '1' in the first test case is equal to the count of '1' in the second test case, the list `k` will be printed.
