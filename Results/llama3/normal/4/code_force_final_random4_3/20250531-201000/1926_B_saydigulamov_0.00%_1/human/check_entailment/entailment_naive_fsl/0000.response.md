Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly identify whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle. It only checks if the number of '1's in the first two rows are equal, which is not a sufficient condition to determine the shape.

For example, if the input is:

3
000
011
110

The program will print "TRIANGLE" because the number of '1's in the first two rows are not equal. However, this is actually a triangle, not a square.

A correct solution would need to check the pattern of '1's in the entire grid, not just the first two rows. It would need to check if the number of '1's in each row is increasing by 2 for a triangle, or if the number of '1's in each row is the same for a square.
