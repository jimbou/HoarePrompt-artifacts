To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `input()`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `input()`. If `input()` is not empty and can be converted to an integer, the loop can execute.

Before the loop starts, `a` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 1, stdin contains 0 test cases, `_` is `a`, `i` is 1, `b` is a string that was inputted from stdin, `k` is an empty list.

To adjust the states, we need to ensure that `input()` is not empty and can be converted to an integer. We also need to adjust the value of `_` to be the result of `int(input())`.

State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case, `_` is the result of `int(input())`, `i` is 1, `b` is a string that was inputted from stdin, `k` is an empty list**
