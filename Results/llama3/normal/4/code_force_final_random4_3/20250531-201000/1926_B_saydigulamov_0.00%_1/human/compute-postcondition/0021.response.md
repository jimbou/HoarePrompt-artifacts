The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than 1.
State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 1, stdin contains 0 test cases, `_` is `a`, `i` is 1, `b` is a string that was inputted from stdin, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` repeated `a` times if '1' is in `b`, otherwise `k` is a list containing `a` zeros. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, then the list `k` is printed.**
