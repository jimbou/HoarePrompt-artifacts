Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 2, `b` is a string representing the first test case, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case (excluding the first one). If `b` contains the digit '1', `k` is a list containing at least one integer (the count of '1' in `b`). Otherwise, `k` is an empty list.***
