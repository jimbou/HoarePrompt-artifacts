Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 0, stdin contains `a` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10) followed by `n` lines, each containing a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid. The size of the triangle or square is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `k` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    b = input()
    if '1' in b:
        k.append(b.count('1'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 0, stdin contains `a-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, `b` is a string. If `b` contains the character '1', `k` is a list containing at least one integer (the count of '1' in string `b`). Otherwise, `k` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `stdin` contains `a-4` test cases if '1' is in `b`, otherwise `a-3` test cases, `_` is 1, `i` is 0, `b` is a string that was inputted from stdin, if '1' is in `b`, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` repeated twice, otherwise `k` is a list containing one zero.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `stdin` contains `a-6` test cases if '1' is in the previous value of `b`, otherwise `a-5` test cases, `_` is 2, `i` is 0, `b` is a string that was inputted from stdin, if '1' is in the previous value of `b`, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in the previous string `b` repeated three times, otherwise `k` is a list containing two zeros




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
