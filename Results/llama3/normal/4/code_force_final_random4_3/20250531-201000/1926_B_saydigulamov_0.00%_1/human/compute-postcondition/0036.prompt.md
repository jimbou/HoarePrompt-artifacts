Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 1, stdin contains 0 test cases, `_` is `a`, `i` is 1, `b` is a string that was inputted from stdin, `k` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    b = input()
    if '1' in b:
        k.append(b.count('1'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case, `_` is the result of `int(input())`, `i` is 1, `b` is a string that was inputted from stdin. If `b` contains the digit '1', `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b`. Otherwise, `k` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 1, stdin contains at least 1 more test case, `_` is the result of `int(input())` (a new integer value), `i` is 1, `b` is a string that was inputted from stdin, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` (if `b` contains the digit '1') or an empty list (if `b` does not contain the digit '1'). If '1' is in `b`, then the count of '1' in string `b` is either 0 (if `b` does not contain the digit '1') or a positive integer (if `b` contains the digit '1').

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 1, stdin contains at least 1 more test case, `_` is the result of `int(input())` (a new integer value), `i` is 1, `b` is a new string that was inputted from stdin, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` (if `b` contains the digit '1') or an empty list (if `b` does not contain the digit '1'). If '1' is in `b`, then the count of '1' in string `b` is either 0 (if `b` does not contain the digit '1') or a positive integer (if `b` contains the digit '1'). If '1' is not in `b`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
