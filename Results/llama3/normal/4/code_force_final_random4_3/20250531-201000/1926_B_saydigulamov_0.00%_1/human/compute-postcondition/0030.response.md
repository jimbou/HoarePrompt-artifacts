The code `k.append(b.count('1'))` appends the count of '1' in string `b` to the list `k`. The value of `b` is a string that was inputted from stdin, and the value of `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` (if `b` contains the digit '1') or an empty list (if `b` does not contain the digit '1').

The count of '1' in string `b` is either 0 (if `b` does not contain the digit '1') or a positive integer (if `b` contains the digit '1'). Therefore, the list `k` will contain either 0 or a positive integer.

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 1, stdin contains at least 1 more test case, `_` is the result of `int(input())` (a new integer value), `i` is 1, `b` is a string that was inputted from stdin, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` (if `b` contains the digit '1') or an empty list (if `b` does not contain the digit '1'), and the count of '1' in string `b` is either 0 (if `b` does not contain the digit '1') or a positive integer (if `b` contains the digit '1').**
