Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains `a` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10) followed by `n` lines, each containing a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid. The size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    k = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        b = input()
        if '1' in b:
            k.append(b.count('1'))
    if k[0] == k[1]:
        print(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 0, stdin contains 0 test cases, `_` is `a`, `i` is 0, `b` is a string that was inputted from stdin, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` repeated `a` times if '1' is in `b`, otherwise `k` is a list containing `a` zeros. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, then the list `k` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 1, stdin contains 0 test cases, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, `b` is an empty string, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in each string inputted from stdin. If the first two elements of `k` are equal, the list `k` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 2, `b` is a string representing the last test case, `_` is equal to the number of test cases, `i` is 2, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in each test case, stdin contains 0 test cases. If the count of '1' in the first test case is equal to the count of '1' in the second test case, the list `k` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
