The code prints the list `k`. The list `k` contains the count of '1' in string `b` repeated `a` times if '1' is in `b`, otherwise `k` is a list containing `a` zeros. Since the value of the first element of `k` is equal to the value of the second element of `k`, all elements in the list `k` are equal.

Output: **[a copies of the count of '1' in string b if '1' is in b, otherwise a zeros]**
