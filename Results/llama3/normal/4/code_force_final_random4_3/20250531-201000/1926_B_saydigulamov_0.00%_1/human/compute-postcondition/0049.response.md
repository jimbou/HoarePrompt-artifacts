Output State: **`a` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 2, `b` is a string representing the next test case, `_` is 1, `i` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case (excluding the first two ones). If `b` contains the digit '1', `k` is a list containing at least one integer (the count of '1' in `b`). Otherwise, `k` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to the next test case from the input, and the stdin now contains at least one test case (excluding the first two ones). The values of `a`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `k` depends on whether the new value of `b` contains the digit '1'. If it does, `k` is a list containing at least one integer (the count of '1' in `b`). Otherwise, `k` is an empty list.
