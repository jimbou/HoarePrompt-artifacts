The code `b = input()` accepts a string from the input and assigns it to `b`. The stdin contains at least 1 test case, so the first test case is assigned to `b`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 2, `b` is a string representing the first test case, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, `k` is an empty list, stdin contains at least 1 test case (excluding the first one).**
