To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The objects in the loop head are `_` and `input()`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 0
* `stdin` contains `a-1` test cases
* `_` is 0
* `i` is 0
* `b` is a string
* If `b` contains the character '1', `k` is a list containing at least one integer (the count of '1' in string `b`). Otherwise, `k` is an empty list.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

* `_` is incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 1.
* `input()` is a function that reads from `stdin`. Since `stdin` contains `a-1` test cases, the next iteration will read the next test case from `stdin`. Therefore, `stdin` will contain `a-2` test cases.

The other variables (`a`, `i`, `b`, and `k`) are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `stdin` contains `a-2` test cases, `_` is 1, `i` is 0, `b` is a string. If `b` contains the character '1', `k` is a list containing at least one integer (the count of '1' in string `b`). Otherwise, `k` is an empty list.**
