The code `k.append(b.count('1'))` appends the count of the digit '1' in the string `b` to the list `k`. The value of `b` is a string representing the first test case and contains the digit '1'. The count of '1' in `b` is at least 1.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 2, `b` is a string representing the first test case and contains the digit '1', `_` is 0, `i` is 2, `k` is a list containing at least one integer (the count of '1' in `b`), stdin contains at least 1 test case (excluding the first one).**
