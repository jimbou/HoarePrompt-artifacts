Output State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case, `_` is the result of `int(input())`, `i` is 1, `b` is a string that was inputted from stdin and contains the digit '1', `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `a`, `_`, `i` and `b` remains the same as in the initial state. However, the list `k` is updated to contain the count of '1' in string `b`. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case.
