Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 0, stdin contains 0 test cases, `_` is `a`, `i` is 0, `b` is a string that was inputted from stdin, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` repeated `a` times if '1' is in `b`, otherwise `k` is a list containing `a` zeros.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `a` still holds an integer value between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 0, but there are no more test cases left in stdin. The loop counter `_` has reached the value of `a`, indicating that the loop has executed `a` times. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 0, as it is not affected by the loop. The variable `b` holds the last string input from stdin. The list `k` contains the count of '1's in the last string `b`, repeated `a` times if '1' is present in `b`, or `a` zeros if '1' is not present in `b`.
