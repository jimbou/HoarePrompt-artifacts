The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than 2.
State: **`a` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 2, stdin contains 0 test cases, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, `b` is an empty string, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in each string inputted from stdin. If the first two elements of `k` are equal, the list `k` is printed.**
