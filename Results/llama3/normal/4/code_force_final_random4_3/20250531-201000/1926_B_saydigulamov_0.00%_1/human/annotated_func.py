#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n lines, each containing a string of n characters that are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid. The size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)
        
    #State: `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than or equal to the number of times the loop executed, stdin contains 0 test cases, `_` is equal to the number of test cases, `i` is equal to the number of times the loop executed minus 1, `b` is a string representing the last test case, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in each test case. If the count of '1' in the first test case is equal to the count of '1' in the second test case, the list `k` is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a grid of '0's and '1's. It counts the number of '1's in each row of the grid and stores these counts in a list. If the first two rows have the same count of '1's, it prints the list of counts. The function processes all test cases in this manner, ultimately consuming all input from standard input.
