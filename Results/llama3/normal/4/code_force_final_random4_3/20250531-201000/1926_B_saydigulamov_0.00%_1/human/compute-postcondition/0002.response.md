Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 0, stdin contains `a` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10) followed by `n` lines, each containing a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid. The size of the triangle or square is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `k` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `k` which is an empty list. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains `a` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and `n` lines of strings. The grid properties also remain unchanged.
