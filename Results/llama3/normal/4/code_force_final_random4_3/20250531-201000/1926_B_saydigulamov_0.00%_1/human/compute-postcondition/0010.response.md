Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `stdin` contains `a-4` test cases, `_` is 1, `i` is 0, `b` is a string that was inputted from stdin, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` repeated twice if `b` contains the character '1', otherwise `k` is a list containing one zero.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to include the count of '1' in string `b` repeated twice if `b` contains the character '1', otherwise `k` is a list containing one zero. The other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in `stdin` has decreased by 1.
