Output State: **`a` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 2, `b` is a string representing the next test case, `_` is 2, `i` is 2, stdin contains at least 0 test case (excluding the first four ones). If `b` contains the digit '1', `k` is a list containing at least one integer (the count of '1' in `b` plus one). Otherwise, `k` is a list containing one zero.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` remains the same, an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 2. The value of `b` is updated to the next test case from the input. The values of `_` and `i` remain unchanged, 2 and 2 respectively. The stdin now contains at least 0 test case (excluding the first four ones). The value of `k` depends on the presence of the digit '1' in `b`. If `b` contains '1', `k` is a list with at least one integer, which is the count of '1' in `b` plus one. If `b` does not contain '1', `k` is a list containing one zero.
