To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `input()`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is greater than the current value of `_`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0.

For the loop to execute again, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Since `stdin` contains at least 1 test case (excluding the first one), `int(input())` will be at least 1.

State: **`a` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 2, `b` is a string representing the first test case, `_` is 1, `i` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case (excluding the first one). If `b` contains the digit '1', `k` is a list containing at least one integer (the count of '1' in `b`). Otherwise, `k` is an empty list.**
