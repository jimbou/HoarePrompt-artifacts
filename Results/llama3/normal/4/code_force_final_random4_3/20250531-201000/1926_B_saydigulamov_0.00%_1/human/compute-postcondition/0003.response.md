The only variables in the loop head are variable  `_` and `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 0, stdin contains `a` test cases, so it needs to be adjusted to `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 0 and `int(input())` is equal to `a` and `_` is 0.
State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 0, stdin contains `a` test cases, `int(input())` is equal to `a`, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, `k` is an empty list**
