Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `stdin` contains `a-6` test cases if '1' is in the previous value of `b`, otherwise `a-5` test cases, `_` is 2, `i` is 0, `b` is a string that was inputted from stdin, if '1' is in the previous value of `b`, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in the previous string `b` repeated twice, otherwise `k` is a list containing one zero**.

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to the new string input from stdin. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1, since one test case has been consumed by the input operation. The other variables remain unchanged.
