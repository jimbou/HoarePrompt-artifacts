Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 2, `b` is a string representing the last test case, `_` is equal to the number of test cases, `i` is 2, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in each test case, stdin contains 0 test cases. If the count of '1' in the first test case is equal to the count of '1' in the second test case, the list `k` is printed.***
