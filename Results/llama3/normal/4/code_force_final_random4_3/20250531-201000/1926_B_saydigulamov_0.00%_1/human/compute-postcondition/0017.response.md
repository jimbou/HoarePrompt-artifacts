Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 0, stdin contains 0 test cases, `_` is `a`, `i` is 0, `b` is a string that was inputted from stdin, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` repeated `a` times if '1' is in `b`, otherwise `k` is a list containing `a` zeros. The current value of the first element of `k` is equal to the current value of the second element of `k`.***
