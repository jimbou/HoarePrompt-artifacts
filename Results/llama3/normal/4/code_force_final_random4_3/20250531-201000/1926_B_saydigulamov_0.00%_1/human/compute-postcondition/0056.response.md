Output State: **`a` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 2, `b` is a string representing the last test case, `_` is equal to the number of test cases, `i` is 2, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in each test case, stdin contains 0 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: the variable `a` remains unchanged, the variable `b` will hold the last test case, the variable `_` will be equal to the number of test cases, the variable `i` remains unchanged, the variable `k` will contain the count of '1' in each test case, and the standard input will be empty.
