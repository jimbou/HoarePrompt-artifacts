To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved are `_` and the input from `stdin`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 0
* `stdin` contains `a-4` test cases if '1' is in `b`, otherwise `a-3` test cases
* `_` is 1
* `i` is 0
* `b` is a string that was inputted from stdin
* if '1' is in `b`, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` repeated twice, otherwise `k` is a list containing one zero

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

* `_` is incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 2.
* The input from `stdin` is consumed by the `int(input())` expression, so the number of test cases in `stdin` decreases by 1.

The updated state is:

State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `stdin` contains `a-5` test cases if '1' is in `b`, otherwise `a-4` test cases, `_` is 2, `i` is 0, `b` is a string that was inputted from stdin, if '1' is in `b`, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` repeated twice, otherwise `k` is a list containing one zero**

Note that the state of `a`, `i`, `b`, and `k` remains unchanged, as they are not directly affected by the loop head.
