The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains `a` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10) followed by `n` lines, each containing a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid. The size of the triangle or square is greater than 1. So for the loop to be executed  `a` must be greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
