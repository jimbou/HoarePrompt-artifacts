Output State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 1, stdin contains 0 test cases, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, `b` is an empty string, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in each string inputted from stdin.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `a` remains unchanged as an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 1. The stdin contains 0 test cases, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variable `_` is 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The variable `i` remains unchanged as 1. The variable `b` is an empty string, indicating that there are no more strings to process. The variable `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in each string inputted from stdin, which represents the total count of '1' in all strings processed by the loop.
