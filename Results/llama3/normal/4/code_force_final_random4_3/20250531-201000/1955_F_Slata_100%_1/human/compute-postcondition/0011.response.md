The code prints the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` by 2 plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` divided by 2 is equal to 3.
Output: ** `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers between 0 and 200, stdin contains t-6 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), t is decreased by 3, the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` by 2 plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` divided by 2 is equal to 3 has been printed, i is 1, and this is printed: the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` by 2 plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` divided by 2 is equal to 3**
