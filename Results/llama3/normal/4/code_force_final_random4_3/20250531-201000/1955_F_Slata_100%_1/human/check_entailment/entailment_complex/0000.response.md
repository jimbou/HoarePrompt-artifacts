Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. This means we need to find the maximum number of times the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

2. The program calculates the sum of the integer divisions of the four numbers by 2, which gives the maximum number of times Bob can win when the numbers are paired up (i.e., when the bitwise XOR of the paired numbers is zero).

3. The program then adds 1 to the sum if the sum of the remainders of the four numbers divided by 2 is equal to 3. This is because when the sum of the remainders is 3, it means that there is one number left that is not paired up, and Eve can remove it to make the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers zero, resulting in one additional win for Bob.

4. The program correctly handles the case where the sum of the remainders is not 3, in which case no additional win is added to the sum.

5. The program iterates over the test cases and prints the calculated sum for each test case, which is the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Correctness: **True**
