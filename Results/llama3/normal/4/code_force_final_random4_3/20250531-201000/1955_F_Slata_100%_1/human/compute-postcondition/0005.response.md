Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers, 0 <= `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` <= 200, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), t is decreased by 2, and the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` by 2 plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` divided by 2 is equal to 3 is being printed**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` have been updated to the four integers read from the input, which are within the range 0 to 200. The stdin now contains t-4 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), as two lines have been consumed by the input operation. The value of t has decreased by 2. The sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` by 2 plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` divided by 2 is equal to 3 is being printed.
