Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers, 0 <= `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` <= 200, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), t is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are assigned the values of the four integers from the input, which are between 0 and 200. The stdin now contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers, since one line has been read. The value of t is decreased by 1, as one line has been processed.
