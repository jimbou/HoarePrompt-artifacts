The code prints the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` by 2 plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` divided by 2 is equal to 3.
Since `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers between 0 and 200, the integer divisions `a // 2`, `b // 2`, `c // 2`, `d // 2` will be integers between 0 and 100.
The sum of these integer divisions will be an integer between 0 and 400.
The expression `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2` will be equal to 3 if and only if exactly three of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are odd.
If this condition is true, the expression `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` will be equal to 1, otherwise it will be equal to 0.
Therefore, the final output will be an integer between 0 and 401.
Output: **an integer between 0 and 401 (which is the sum of the integer divisions of a, b, c, d by 2 plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of a, b, c, d divided by 2 is equal to 3)**
