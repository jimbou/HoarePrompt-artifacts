The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and input(), so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input().  If the input() is at least 1 the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200). So for the loop to be executed  the input() must be at least 1 and the i is 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), i is 0, input() must be at least 1**
