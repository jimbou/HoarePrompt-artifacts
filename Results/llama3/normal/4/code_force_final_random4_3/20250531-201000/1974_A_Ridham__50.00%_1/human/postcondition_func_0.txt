This function reads a series of pairs of integers from standard input, calculates the minimum number of screens required to display each pair, and prints the results. The calculation is based on the total space required for each pair, considering the space needed for the x-coordinate and the space needed for the y-coordinate, which is four times the y-coordinate value. If the space required for the x-coordinate exceeds the remaining cells available after allocating space for the y-coordinate, additional screens are calculated to accommodate the excess space. The function processes all input pairs and prints the minimum number of screens required for each pair, one result per line.
