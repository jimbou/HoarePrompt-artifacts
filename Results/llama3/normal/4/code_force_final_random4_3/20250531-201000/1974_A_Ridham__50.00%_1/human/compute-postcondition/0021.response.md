Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), result is a list containing either screen_require_for_y or extra_screen + screen_require_for_y, stdin contains either n-3 or n-4 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99), space_x is an integer equal to the new value of x, space_y is an integer equal to 4 times the new value of y, total_space is an integer equal to 5 times the new value of x plus 4 times the new value of y, screen_require_for_y is an integer equal to y/2 if y is even, or (y // 2 + 1) if y is odd, and remaining_cells is an integer equal to 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y.**

The code executes as follows:

1. The first line reads two space-separated integers x and y from stdin, which now contains either n-3 or n-4 lines. The values of x and y are used to update the variables space_x, space_y, and total_space.

2. The second line assigns the value of x to space_x.

3. The third line assigns the value of 4 times y to space_y.

4. The fourth line assigns the value of 5 times x plus 4 times y to total_space.

The values of n, result, screen_require_for_y, and remaining_cells remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of stdin is updated as it now contains either n-3 or n-4 lines. The values of space_x, space_y, and total_space are updated based on the new values of x and y.
