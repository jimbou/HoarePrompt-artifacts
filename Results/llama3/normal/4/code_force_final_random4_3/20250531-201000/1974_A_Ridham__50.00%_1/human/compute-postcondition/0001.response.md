To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `_` and `n`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, we don't need to worry about its value. However, we do need to ensure that `n` is at least 1, because the loop will only execute if `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `result` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `n-1` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99)**
