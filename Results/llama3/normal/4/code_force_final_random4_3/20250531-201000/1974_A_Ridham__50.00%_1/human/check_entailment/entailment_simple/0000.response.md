Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of screens required to place application icons on a desktop. The program takes the number of test cases as input, followed by the number of applications with 1x1 icons and 2x2 icons for each test case.

The program calculates the total space required for each type of icon and then determines the minimum number of screens needed to accommodate all the icons. It takes into account the fact that each screen has a 5x3 grid and that 2x2 icons occupy a square of 4 cells.

The program uses a loop to iterate over each test case and calculates the minimum number of screens required for each case. It then appends the result to a list and finally prints the results for all test cases.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible scenarios, including cases where the number of 2x2 icons is odd or even. The use of integer division (//) and modulo operations (%) ensures that the program accurately calculates the minimum number of screens required.

Correctness: **True**
