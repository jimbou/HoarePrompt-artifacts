The `print` statement will print the elements of the `result` list, one element per line.

The `result` list contains either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` for each iteration of the loop. Since `n` is an integer equal to 0, the loop will not iterate, and the `result` list will be empty.

Therefore, the `print` statement will print nothing, as there are no elements in the `result` list to print.

Output: **(empty string)**
