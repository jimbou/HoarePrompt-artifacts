Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `result` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `n-2` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99), `space_x` is an integer equal to `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to `4y`, `total_space` is an integer equal to `5x + 4y`, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y/2` if `y` is even, or `(y // 2 + 1)` if `y` is odd, and `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, the `result` list is still empty, and the input in `stdin` is unchanged. The values of `space_x`, `space_y`, and `total_space` are still dependent on the values of `x` and `y`. The value of `screen_require_for_y` is calculated based on the value of `y`, and the new variable `remaining_cells` is calculated using the values of `screen_require_for_y` and `space_y`.
