Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `stdin` contains either `n-2` or `n-3` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99), `space_x` is an integer equal to `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to `4y`, `total_space` is an integer equal to `5x + 4y`, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y/2` if `y` is even, or `(y // 2 + 1)` if `y` is odd, and `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, then `result` contains `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` contains `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is calculated based on `extra_space` which is `space_x - remaining_cells`.***
