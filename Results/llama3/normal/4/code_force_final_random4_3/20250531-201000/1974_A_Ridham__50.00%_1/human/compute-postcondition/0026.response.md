Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` and `screen_require_for_y`, `space_x` is an integer equal to the new value of `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to 4 times the new value of `y`, `total_space` is an integer equal to 5 times the new value of `x` plus 4 times the new value of `y`, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y/2` if `y` is even, or (`y // 2 + 1`) if `y` is odd, and `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 * `screen_require_for_y` - `space_y`, stdin contains either `n-3` or `n-4` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99).**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, which is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive). The `result` list now contains an additional element, which is `screen_require_for_y`. The values of `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `screen_require_for_y`, and `remaining_cells` remain the same as before. The stdin still contains either `n-3` or `n-4` lines, each with two space-separated integers `x` and `y`.
