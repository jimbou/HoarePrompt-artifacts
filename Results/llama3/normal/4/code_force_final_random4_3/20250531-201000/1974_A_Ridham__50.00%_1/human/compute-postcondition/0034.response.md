Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), result is a list containing either screen_require_for_y or extra_screen + screen_require_for_y, stdin contains either n-3 or n-4 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99), space_x is an integer equal to the new value of x, space_y is an integer equal to 4 times the new value of y, total_space is an integer equal to 5 times the new value of x plus 4 times the new value of y, screen_require_for_y is an integer equal to y/2 if y is even, or (y // 2 + 1) if y is odd, and remaining_cells is an integer equal to 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y. If space_x is less than or equal to remaining_cells, then result is a list containing either screen_require_for_y or extra_screen + screen_require_for_y and screen_require_for_y. Otherwise, result is a list containing either screen_require_for_y or extra_screen + screen_require_for_y and extra_screen + screen_require_for_y. If space_x is a multiple of 15, then extra_screen is an integer equal to space_x // 15. Otherwise, extra_screen is an integer equal to extra_space // 15 + 1.**

The code reads a line from stdin, which contains two space-separated integers x and y. It then assigns the value of x to space_x and the value of y to space_y. The total_space is calculated as the sum of space_x and space_y. The values of screen_require_for_y, remaining_cells, and extra_screen are not directly modified by the code, but their values depend on the new values of space_x and space_y. The result list is not directly modified by the code, but its contents depend on the values of space_x, remaining_cells, and extra_screen.
