Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `result` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `n-2` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99), `space_x` is an integer equal to `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to `4y`, `total_space` is an integer equal to `5x + 4y`, `y` is even, and `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y/2`.**

In this output state, the value of `screen_require_for_y` has been updated to be equal to half of the current value of `y`, which is even. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `n-2` lines of input.
