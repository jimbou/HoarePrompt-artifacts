Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place the application icons. It first calculates the total space required for the 2x2 icons and the remaining cells that can be used for the 1x1 icons. If the total space required for the 1x1 icons is less than or equal to the remaining cells, it simply returns the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. Otherwise, it calculates the extra space required for the 1x1 icons and adds it to the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including when there are no 2x2 icons, no 1x1 icons, or a combination of both. It also handles cases where the total space required for the 1x1 icons is a multiple of 15, in which case it can be placed on a single screen.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
