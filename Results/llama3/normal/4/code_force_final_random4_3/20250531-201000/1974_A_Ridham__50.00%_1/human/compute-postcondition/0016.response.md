Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `result` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `n-2` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99), `space_x` is an integer equal to `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to `4y`, `total_space` is an integer equal to `5x + 4y`, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y/2` if `y` is even, or `(y // 2 + 1)` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `extra_space` is an integer equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `extra_space // 15 + 1`, `space_x` is larger than `remaining_cells`, and `space_x` is not a multiple of 15.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `extra_screen` which is calculated as the integer division of `extra_space` by 15, plus 1. The value of `extra_screen` is dependent on the values of `space_x`, `remaining_cells`, and `extra_space`, which are all still valid after the code has been executed.
