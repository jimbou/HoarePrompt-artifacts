Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately calculates the minimum number of screens required to display the application icons based on their sizes and the available space on each screen.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  It first calculates the total space required for the x and y icons.
2.  It then determines the number of screens required to accommodate the y icons, considering that each y icon occupies 4 cells.
3.  Next, it calculates the remaining cells available on the screens allocated for the y icons.
4.  If the space required for the x icons exceeds the remaining cells, it calculates the additional screens needed to accommodate the excess space.
5.  Finally, it adds the screens required for the y icons and the additional screens required for the x icons (if any) to get the total minimum number of screens required.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles different scenarios, including cases where the x or y icons require additional screens.

Correctness: **True**
