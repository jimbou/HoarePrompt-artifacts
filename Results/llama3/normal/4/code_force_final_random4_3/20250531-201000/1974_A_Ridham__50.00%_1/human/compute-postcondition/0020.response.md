The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is not specified, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `stdin` contains either `n-2` or `n-3` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99), `space_x` is an integer equal to `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to `4y`, `total_space` is an integer equal to `5x + 4y`, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y/2` if `y` is even, or `(y // 2 + 1)` if `y` is odd, and `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, then `result` contains `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` contains `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is calculated based on `extra_space` which is `space_x - remaining_cells**
