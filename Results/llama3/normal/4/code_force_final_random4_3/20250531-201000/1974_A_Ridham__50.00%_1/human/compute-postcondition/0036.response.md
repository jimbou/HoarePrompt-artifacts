Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `space_x` is an integer equal to the new value of x, `space_y` is an integer equal to 4 times the new value of y, `total_space` is an integer equal to 5 times the new value of x plus 4 times the new value of y, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is a multiple of 15, otherwise `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `space_x // 15 + 1`, stdin contains either `n-3` or `n-4` lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

In this output state, the value of `screen_require_for_y` has been updated to `y // 2 + 1`, which is the new value of `y` divided by 2 and rounded up to the nearest integer. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains either `n-3` or `n-4` lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y.
