Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `extra_space` is an integer equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, `space_x` is an integer equal to the new value of x, `space_y` is an integer equal to 4 times the new value of y, `total_space` is an integer equal to 5 times the new value of x plus 4 times the new value of y, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to y/2 if y is even, or (y // 2 + 1) if y is odd, `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 * `screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `extra_space // 15 + 1`, and stdin contains either n-3 or n-4 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `extra_screen` is now calculated as `extra_space // 15 + 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
