Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `result` is an empty list, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to (y // 2 + 1), `space_x` is an integer equal to x, `space_y` is an integer equal to 4y, `total_space` is an integer equal to 5x + 4y, `y` is an odd number, stdin contains n-2 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `screen_require_for_y` has been calculated as the integer division of `y` by 2 plus 1. The values of `n`, `result`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, and `y` remain unchanged. The input in stdin remains the same, containing `n-2` lines of two space-separated integers `x` and `y`.
