Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains either n-3 or n-4 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99), `space_x` is an integer equal to the new value of x, `space_y` is an integer equal to 4 times the new value of y, `total_space` is an integer equal to 5 times the new value of x plus 4 times the new value of y, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to y/2 if y is even, or (y // 2 + 1) if y is odd, `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 * `screen_require_for_y` - `space_y`, `extra_space` is an integer equal to `space_x` - `remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `extra_space` divided by 15 and then rounded up to the nearest integer, and `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen` + `screen_require_for_y` and either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen` + `screen_require_for_y` depending on the values of `space_x`, `remaining_cells`, and `y`.**

In this output state, the value of `extra_screen` has been updated to be the integer division of `extra_space` by 15, rounded up to the nearest integer. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `extra_screen` is now a specific integer value that depends on the values of `extra_space` and the division by 15.
