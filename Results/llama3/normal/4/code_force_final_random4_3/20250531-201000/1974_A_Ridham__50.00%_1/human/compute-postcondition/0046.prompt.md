Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), result is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    space_x = x * 1
    space_y = y * 4
    total_space = space_y + space_x
    if y % 2 == 0:
        screen_require_for_y = y // 2
    else:
        screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
    remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
    if space_x <= remaining_cells:
        result.append(screen_require_for_y)
    else:
        extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
        if space_x % 15 == 0:
            extra_screen = space_x // 15
        else:
            extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
        result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `stdin` contains either `n-2` or `n-3` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99), `space_x` is an integer equal to `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to `4y`, `total_space` is an integer equal to `5x + 4y`, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y/2` if `y` is even, or `(y // 2 + 1)` if `y` is odd, and `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, then `result` contains `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` contains `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is calculated based on `extra_space` which is `space_x - remaining_cells`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), result is a list containing either screen_require_for_y or extra_screen + screen_require_for_y, stdin contains either n-3 or n-4 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99), space_x is an integer equal to the new value of x, space_y is an integer equal to 4 times the new value of y, total_space is an integer equal to 5 times the new value of x plus 4 times the new value of y, screen_require_for_y is an integer equal to y/2 if y is even, or (y // 2 + 1) if y is odd, and remaining_cells is an integer equal to 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y. If space_x is less than or equal to remaining_cells, then result is a list containing either screen_require_for_y or extra_screen + screen_require_for_y and screen_require_for_y. Otherwise, result is a list containing either screen_require_for_y or extra_screen + screen_require_for_y and extra_screen + screen_require_for_y. If space_x is a multiple of 15, then extra_screen is an integer equal to space_x // 15. Otherwise, extra_screen is an integer equal to extra_space // 15 + 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains either n-3 or n-4 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99), `space_x` is an integer equal to the new value of x, `space_y` is an integer equal to 4 times the new value of y, `total_space` is an integer equal to 5 times the new value of x plus 4 times the new value of y, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to y/2 if y is even, or (y // 2 + 1) if y is odd, `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 * `screen_require_for_y` - `space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, then `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen` + `screen_require_for_y` and `screen_require_for_y`. If `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, then `extra_space` is an integer equal to `space_x` - `remaining_cells`, and `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen` + `screen_require_for_y` and either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen` + `screen_require_for_y` depending on the values of `space_x`, `remaining_cells`, and `y`. If `space_x` is a multiple of 15, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `space_x` divided by 15. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `extra_space` divided by 15 and then rounded up to the nearest integer. The list `result` now contains an additional element which is the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
