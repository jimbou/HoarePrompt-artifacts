Output: **`n` is an integer equal to 0, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` for each iteration of the loop, `stdin` is empty, `space_x` is an integer equal to the last value of `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to 4 times the last value of `y`, `total_space` is an integer equal to 5 times the last value of `x` plus 4 times the last value of `y`, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y/2` if `y` is even, or `(y // 2 + 1)` if `y` is odd, and `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, and the elements of the `result` list are being printed, each on a new line.**
