Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `stdin` contains either `n-3` or `n-4` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99), `space_x` is an integer equal to the new value of `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to 4 times the new value of `y`, `total_space` is an integer equal to 5 times the new value of `x` plus 4 times the new value of `y`, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y // 2`, and `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 * `screen_require_for_y` - `space_y`.**

In this output state, the value of `screen_require_for_y` has been updated to be equal to `y // 2`, which means it is now an integer equal to the integer division of `y` by 2. The other variables remain unchanged, and their values are still valid as specified in the initial state.
