The only object in the loop head is variable  i and set cx, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set cx.  If the set cx has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, cx has at least 1 element, i is the first element in the set cx. So for the loop to be executed one more time the set cx must have at least 2 elements and the i is the second element in the set cx.
State: **`n` is 0, `_` is 0, `t` is at least 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is a set that must have at least 2 elements, `tmp` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the second element in the set `cx`, and stdin contains no input, and `bx` is not larger than `ax`. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (i.e., `i` is greater than or equal to -1 and less than or equal to 1000000007), then `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1000000007. Otherwise, `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1000000008 - `tmp`.**
