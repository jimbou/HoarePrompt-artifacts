Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `_` is 2, `t` is at least `n+2`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1000000008 - `tmp`, `i` is not defined, `tmp` is not defined. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `ax` and `cx` are either 1000000007, the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, or the maximum of `x` and -1, and either an empty set or a set containing one element which is `x` respectively. If `a` is 2, `bx` is -1, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, or the minimum of `x` and the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing one element which is `x`. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `bx` is -1, `ax` is either 1000000007, the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, or the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`.***
