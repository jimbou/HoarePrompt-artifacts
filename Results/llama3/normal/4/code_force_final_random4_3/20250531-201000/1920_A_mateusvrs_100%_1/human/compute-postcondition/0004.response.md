Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `_` is 0**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `r`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`, and `_` remain unchanged. The code only affects the values of `a` and `x`, which are assigned the values of the two integers from the input, respectively. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.
