Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `_` is 1, `t` is at least n+2, `a` is an integer not equal to 1 and not equal to 2, `x` is an integer, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`, `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1000000008 - tmp, `i` is not defined, `tmp` is not defined, stdin contains no input**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cx` has changed to a set containing one element which is `x`. All other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
