Output State: **`t` is at least `n+1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is assigned the first integer from the input, `x` is assigned the second integer from the input, stdin contains no test cases. If `a` is 1, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is `x`, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is `x` if `x` is greater than -1, otherwise `bx` is -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is `x`, and `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`.**

In this output state, the value of `bx` has been updated to be the maximum of `x` and its previous value. If `a` is 1, `bx` is now `x`. If `a` is 2, `bx` is now `x` if `x` is greater than -1, otherwise it remains -1. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `bx` is now `x`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
