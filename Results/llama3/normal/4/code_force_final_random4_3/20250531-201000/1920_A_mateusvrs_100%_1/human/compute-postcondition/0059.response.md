The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is at least `n+1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains no test cases. If `a` is 1, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`.**
