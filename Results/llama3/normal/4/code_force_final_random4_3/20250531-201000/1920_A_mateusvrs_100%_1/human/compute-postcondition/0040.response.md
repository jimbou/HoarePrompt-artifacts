To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `i` and the set `cx`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the set `cx`. At the end of the last iteration, `cx` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `cx` must have at least 3 elements.

Since `i` is the next element in `cx`, we need to adjust its value to be the next element in the set. We also need to adjust the value of `tmp` based on whether the next element `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive).

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is at least 1, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `_` is n-1, `ax` is the minimum of all x values where a is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all x values where a is 1, `cx` is a set containing all x values where a is not 1 or 2 and must have at least 3 elements, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`. If the next element `i` in the set `cx` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), then `tmp` is 2. Otherwise, `tmp` is 1, and `i` is the next element in `cx`.**

Note that we only adjusted the states of `i` and `cx`, as they are the only objects in the loop head.
