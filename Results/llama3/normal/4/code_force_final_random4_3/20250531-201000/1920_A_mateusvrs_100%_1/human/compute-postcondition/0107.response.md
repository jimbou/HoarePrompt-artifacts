Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `_` is 2, `t` is at least `n+2`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `bx` is -1, `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1000000008 - `tmp`, `i` is not defined, `tmp` is not defined, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, or the minimum of `x` and the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing one element which is `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ax` has been updated to be the minimum of `x` and its previous value, which was either 1000000007, the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, or the maximum of `x` and -1. All other variables remain unchanged.
