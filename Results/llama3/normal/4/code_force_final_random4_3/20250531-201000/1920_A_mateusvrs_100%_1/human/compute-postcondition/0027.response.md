Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `a` times `x`. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `cx` contains the integer `x`.***
