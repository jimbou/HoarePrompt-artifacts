Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `x` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `_` is 0. If `a` is 1, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`.***
