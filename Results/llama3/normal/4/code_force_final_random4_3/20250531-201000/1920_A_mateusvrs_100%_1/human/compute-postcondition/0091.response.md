To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop variable, and `t`, which is the upper limit of the range.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is equal to `n`, and `t` is at least `n+1`. To execute the loop again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes `n+1`.

The state of `t` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables in the state (`a`, `x`, `ax`, `bx`, `cx`, `r`, `i`, and `tmp`) are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is at least `n+2`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `_` is `n+1`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is a set containing at least one element which is `x`. If `bx` is higher than `ax`, then `r` is a list containing one element which is 0. Otherwise, `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is the same as before and the second element is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, and `cx` is a set containing at least three elements, `i` is equal to the last element in the set `cx`, and `tmp` is either equal to the number of elements in `cx` or less than the number of elements in `cx` depending on whether all elements in `cx` are within the range of `bx` and `ax`.**
