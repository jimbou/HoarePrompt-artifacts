Output State: **`t` is at least `n+1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `a` is an integer assigned the first integer from the input, `x` is an integer assigned the second integer from the input, stdin contains no test cases. If `a` is 1, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is `x` if the condition in the if statement is true, otherwise `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is an empty set if the condition in the if statement is true, otherwise `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is `x` if `x` is greater than -1 and the condition in the if statement is true, otherwise `bx` is -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `ax` is 1000000007 if the condition in the if statement is true, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is `x` if the condition in the if statement is true, otherwise `bx` is -1, and `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x` if the condition in the if statement is false, otherwise `cx` is an empty set.**

The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` assigns the first integer from the input to `a` and the second integer to `x`. Since the initial state already specifies the values of `a` and `x` based on the input, the code does not change the values of `a` and `x`. The other variables `t`, `r`, `n`, `_`, `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` are not affected by the code. The stdin contains no test cases, so it remains empty.
