Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, r is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n lines, each containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cx = set()
    ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
    bx = -1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, x = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1:
            bx = max(x, bx)
        elif a == 2:
            ax = min(x, ax)
        else:
            cx.add(x)
    if bx > ax:
        r.append(0)
    else:
        tmp = 0
        for i in cx:
            if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                tmp += 1
        r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is at least 1, r is a list containing one element, n is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains no test cases, _ is n-1. ax is the minimum of all x values where a is 2, bx is the maximum of all x values where a is 1, cx is a set containing all x values where a is not 1 or 2. If bx > ax, then r contains 0. Otherwise, r contains ax - bx + 1 - tmp, where tmp is the number of elements in cx that are within the range of bx and ax (inclusive), and cx is an empty set.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is at least n+1, n is an integer between 2 and 100, _ is n, a is an integer, x is an integer, ax is the minimum of x and 1000000007, bx is the maximum of x and -1, and cx is a set containing at least one element which is x. If bx is higher than ax, then r is a list containing one element which is 0. Otherwise, r is a list containing two elements, the first element is the same as before and the second element is ax - bx + 1 - tmp, and cx is a set containing at least three elements, i is equal to the last element in the set cx, and tmp is either equal to the number of elements in cx or less than the number of elements in cx depending on whether all elements in cx are within the range of bx and ax.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is 0, `_` is 0, `t` is at least 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is 1000000007. If `bx` is greater than 1000000007, `bx` is greater than 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set, `r` is a list containing three elements, the first element is 0, the second element is 1000000008 - `tmp`, and the third element is 0, `i` is not defined, `tmp` is not defined, and stdin contains no input. Otherwise, `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set, `tmp` is 0, `i` is not defined, `r` is a list containing three elements, the first element is 0, the second element is 1000000007, and the third element is 1000000008, and stdin contains no input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
