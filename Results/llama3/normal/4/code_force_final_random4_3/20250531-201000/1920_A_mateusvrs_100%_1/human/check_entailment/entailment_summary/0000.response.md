Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program initializes variables `ax` and `bx` to keep track of the minimum and maximum values of `x` for constraints of type 1 and 2, respectively. It also initializes a set `cx` to store the values of `x` for constraints of type 3.

2. The program then iterates over each constraint. If the constraint is of type 1, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `bx` and `x`. If the constraint is of type 2, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `ax` and `x`. If the constraint is of type 3, it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

3. After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If this is the case, it means that there are no possible values of `k` that satisfy all constraints, so it appends 0 to the result list.

4. If `bx` is not greater than `ax`, the program calculates the number of possible values of `k` that satisfy all constraints. It does this by subtracting `bx` from `ax`, adding 1 (to include both `bx` and `ax` in the count), and then subtracting the number of values in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.

5. Finally, the program prints the result list, with each element on a new line.

Correctness: **True**
