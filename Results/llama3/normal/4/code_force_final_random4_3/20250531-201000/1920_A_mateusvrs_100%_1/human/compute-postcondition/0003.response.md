According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is at least 1, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case. However, only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, which are `_` and `n`. 

For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. Since `n` is already an integer between 2 and 100, it already satisfies this condition. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop execution.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `_` is 0**
