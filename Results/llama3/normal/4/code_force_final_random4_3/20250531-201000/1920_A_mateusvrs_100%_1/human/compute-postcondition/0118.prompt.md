Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, t is at least n+2, _ is n+1, a is an integer, x is an integer, ax is 1000000007, bx is -1, cx is an empty set, r is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1000000008 - tmp, i is not defined, tmp is not defined, stdin contains no input
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    a, x = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 1:
        bx = max(x, bx)
    elif a == 2:
        ax = min(x, ax)
    else:
        cx.add(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is at least 1, `_` is 1, `t` is at least `n+2`, `x` is an integer, `bx` is -1, `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1000000008 - `tmp`, `i` is not defined, `tmp` is not defined, stdin contains no input. If `a` is 1, then `ax` is 1000000007 and `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 1 or 2, then `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is at least 2, `_` is 2, `t` is at least `n+2`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1000000008 - `tmp`, `i` is not defined, `tmp` is not defined. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `ax` and `cx` are either 1000000007, the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, or the maximum of `x` and -1, and either an empty set or a set containing one element which is `x` respectively. If `a` is 2, `bx` is -1, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, or the minimum of `x` and the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing one element which is `x`. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `bx` is -1, `ax` is either 1000000007, the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, or the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is at least 3, `_` is 3, `t` is at least `n+2`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1000000008 - `tmp`, `i` is not defined, `tmp` is not defined. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the previous value of `ax`. If `a` is not 1 or 2, then `cx` contains `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
