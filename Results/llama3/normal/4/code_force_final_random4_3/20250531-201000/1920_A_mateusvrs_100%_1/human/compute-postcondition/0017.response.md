Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `_` is 1. If `a` is 1, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ax` has been updated to be the minimum of `x` and its previous value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `a` being 1, 2, or not 1 or 2 still apply, but the value of `ax` has been updated accordingly.
