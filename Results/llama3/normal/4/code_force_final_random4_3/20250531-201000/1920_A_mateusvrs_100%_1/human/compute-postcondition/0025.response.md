Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `_` is 2, `cx` contains the integer `x`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases**

In this output state, the value of `cx` has been updated to include the integer `x`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus four test cases.
