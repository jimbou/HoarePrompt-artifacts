Output State: **t is at least 1, r is a list containing one element 0, n is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains no test cases, _ is n-1. ax is the minimum of all x values where a is 2, bx is the maximum of all x values where a is 1, cx is a set containing all x values where a is not 1 or 2. The current value of bx is greater than the current value of ax.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t remains the same, which is at least 1. The list r now contains one element, which is 0. The value of n remains the same, which is an integer between 2 and 100. There are still no test cases in stdin. The value of _ remains the same, which is n-1. The values of ax, bx, and cx remain the same, which are the minimum of all x values where a is 2, the maximum of all x values where a is 1, and a set containing all x values where a is not 1 or 2, respectively. The current value of bx is still greater than the current value of ax.
