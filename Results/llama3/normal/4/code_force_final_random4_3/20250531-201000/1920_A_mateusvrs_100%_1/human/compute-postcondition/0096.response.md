Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `_` is 1, `t` is at least `n+2`, `a` is 1, `x` is an integer, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is an empty set, `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1000000008 - `tmp`, `i` is not defined, `tmp` is not defined, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `bx` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value (-1) and the value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged, and there is still no input in stdin.
