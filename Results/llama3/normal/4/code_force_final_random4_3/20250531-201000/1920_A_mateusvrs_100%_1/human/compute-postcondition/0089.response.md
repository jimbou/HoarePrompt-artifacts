Output State: **`t` is at least `n+1`, `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is the same as before and the second element is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `_` is `n`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is a set containing at least three elements, `i` is equal to the last element in the set cx, and `tmp` is either equal to the number of elements in `cx` or less than the number of elements in `cx` depending on whether all elements in `cx` are within the range of `bx` and `ax`.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to include a new element, which is the result of the expression `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The length of `r` has increased by 1, and it now contains two elements. The value of `tmp` is still dependent on whether all elements in `cx` are within the range of `bx` and `ax`.
