Output State: **t is at least 1, r is an empty list, n is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains no test cases, _ is n-1, ax is the minimum of all x values where a is 2, bx is the maximum of all x values where a is 1, cx is a set containing all x values where a is not 1 or 2, bx is less than or equal to ax, tmp is 0**

In this output state, all the initial state variables remain unchanged, and a new variable `tmp` is introduced with a value of 0. The rest of the variables retain their initial values and properties.
