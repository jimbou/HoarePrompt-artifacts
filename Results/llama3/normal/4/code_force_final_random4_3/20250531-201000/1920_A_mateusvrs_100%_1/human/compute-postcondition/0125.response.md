Output State: **`n` is 0, `_` is 0, `t` is at least 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is a set that must have at least 1 element, `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1000000007, `tmp` is 1, `i` is the first element in the set `cx`, and stdin contains no input, and `bx` is not larger than `ax`. The current value of `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax`, meaning `i` is greater than or equal to -1 and less than or equal to 1000000007.**

In natural language, the output state is: All variables keep their initial values except for `tmp` which is now 1 and `r` which is now a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1000000007. The set `cx` still has at least 1 element, and the value of `i` is still within the range of `bx` and `ax`.
