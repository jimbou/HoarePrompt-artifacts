To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `cx`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `cx`. If the set `cx` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cx` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the set `cx`.

For the loop to execute again, `cx` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` must be the third element in the set `cx`.

State: **`n` is 0, `_` is 0, `t` is at least 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is a set that must have at least 3 elements, `tmp` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the third element in the set `cx`, and stdin contains no input, and `bx` is not larger than `ax`. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (i.e., `i` is greater than or equal to -1 and less than or equal to 1000000007), then `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1000000007. Otherwise, `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1000000008 - `tmp`.**
