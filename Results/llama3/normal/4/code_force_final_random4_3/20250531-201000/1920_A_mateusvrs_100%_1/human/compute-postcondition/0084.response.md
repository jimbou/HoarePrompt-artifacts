Postcondition: ***`t` is at least `n+1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `_` is `n`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is a set containing at least two elements, `i` is equal to `y`. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax`, then `tmp` is 1, otherwise `tmp` remains 0.***
