Output State: **t is at least n+1, r is a list containing one element, n is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains no test cases, _ is n, ax is 1000000007, bx is -1, cx is an empty set.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to an integer between 2 and 100, as it was assigned the value from the input. The value of `ax` has been updated to 1000000007, and the value of `bx` has been updated to -1. The set `cx` is now empty. The other variables, `t`, `r`, and `_`, remain unchanged.
