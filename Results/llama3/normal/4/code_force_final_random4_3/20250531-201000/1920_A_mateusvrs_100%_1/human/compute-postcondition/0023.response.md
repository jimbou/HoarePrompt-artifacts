Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `_` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `bx` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus four test cases.
