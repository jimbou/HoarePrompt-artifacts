To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` in the loop head. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `r` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n lines, each containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9)**
