Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is at least `n+1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `_` is `n`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `tmp` is 0, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`, and `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`.
Code of the loop:
for i in cx:
    if i >= bx and i <= ax:
        tmp += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is at least `n+1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `_` is `n`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), then `tmp` is 1 and `i` is equal to `x`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is at least `n+1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `_` is `n`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is a set containing at least two elements, `i` is equal to `y`. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax`, then `tmp` is 1, otherwise `tmp` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is at least `n+1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `_` is `n`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is a set containing at least three elements, `i` is equal to the next element in the set cx. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax`, then `tmp` is 2. Otherwise, `tmp` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
