Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `_` is n-1, `ax` is the minimum of all x values where a is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all x values where a is 1, `cx` is a set containing all x values where a is not 1 or 2 and must have at least 2 elements, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is 2 if the next element `i` in the set `cx` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `i` is the next element in `cx`.**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been incremented by 1. If the next element `i` in the set `cx` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), then `tmp` is now 2; otherwise, `tmp` remains 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
