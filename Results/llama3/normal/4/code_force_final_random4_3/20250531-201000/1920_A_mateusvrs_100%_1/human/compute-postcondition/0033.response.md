According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cx`. If `cx` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `cx` is a set containing all x values where a is not 1 or 2. So for the loop to be executed, `cx` must have at least 1 element and `i` is the first element in the set `cx`.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains no test cases, `_` is n-1, `ax` is the minimum of all x values where a is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all x values where a is 1, `cx` is a set containing all x values where a is not 1 or 2 and must have at least 1 element, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is 0, `i` is the first element in the set `cx`**
