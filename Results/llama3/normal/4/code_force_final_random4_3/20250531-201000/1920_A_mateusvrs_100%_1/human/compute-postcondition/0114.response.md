Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `_` is 3, `t` is at least `n+2`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1000000008 - `tmp`, `i` is not defined, `tmp` is not defined, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the previous value of `ax`.**

In this output state, the value of `ax` has been updated to be the minimum of `x` and its previous value. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. Note that the value of `ax` is now a specific value, which is the minimum of `x` and its previous value, rather than just being an integer.
