Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 1, r is an empty list, n is an integer between 2 and 100, cx is an empty set, ax is 1000000007, bx is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    a, x = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 1:
        bx = max(x, bx)
    elif a == 2:
        ax = min(x, ax)
    else:
        cx.add(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is at least 1, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `x` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `_` is 0. If `a` is 1, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is at least 1, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `_` is 1. If `a` is 1, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is `x` if the if condition is true, otherwise `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is an empty set if the if condition is true, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is `x` if `x` is greater than -1 and the if condition is true, otherwise `bx` is -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `ax` is 1000000007 if the if condition is true, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is `x` if the if condition is true, otherwise `bx` is -1, and `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is at least 1, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `a` times `x`. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `cx` contains the integer `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
