Output State: **t is at least n+1, r is a list containing one element, n is an integer between 2 and 100, _ is n, a is an integer, x is an integer, stdin contains no test cases. ax is the minimum of x and 1000000007, bx is the maximum of x and -1, and cx is a set containing one element which is x.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` is still at least `n+1`, the list `r` still contains one element, and the integer `n` is still between 2 and 100. The variable `_` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times. The variables `a` and `x` are still integers, and the standard input `stdin` contains no test cases. The variable `ax` is now the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`.
