Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `_` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `a` times `x`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases**

In this output state, the value of `ax` has been updated to be the minimum of `x` and `a` times `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ax` is now a specific expression that depends on the values of `x` and `a`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus four test cases.
