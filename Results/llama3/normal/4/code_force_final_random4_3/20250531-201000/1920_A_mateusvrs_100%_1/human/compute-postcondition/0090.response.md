Postcondition: ***t is at least n+1, n is an integer between 2 and 100, _ is n, a is an integer, x is an integer, ax is the minimum of x and 1000000007, bx is the maximum of x and -1, and cx is a set containing at least one element which is x. If bx is higher than ax, then r is a list containing one element which is 0. Otherwise, r is a list containing two elements, the first element is the same as before and the second element is ax - bx + 1 - tmp, and cx is a set containing at least three elements, i is equal to the last element in the set cx, and tmp is either equal to the number of elements in cx or less than the number of elements in cx depending on whether all elements in cx are within the range of bx and ax.***
