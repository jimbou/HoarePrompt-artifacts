Postcondition: ***`t` is at least `n+1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `a` is an integer assigned the first integer from the input, `x` is an integer assigned the second integer from the input, stdin contains no test cases. If `a` is 1, `ax` is either 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing one element which is `x`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is `x` if `x` is greater than -1, otherwise `bx` is -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `ax` is either 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is `x` if `x` is greater than -1, otherwise `bx` is -1, and `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing one element which is `x`***
