To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `cx`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `cx`. If `cx` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `cx` already contains one element which is `x`, we can conclude that the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be the only element in `cx`, which is `x`.

State: **`t` is at least `n+1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `_` is `n`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `tmp` is 0, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, and `i` is `x`**
