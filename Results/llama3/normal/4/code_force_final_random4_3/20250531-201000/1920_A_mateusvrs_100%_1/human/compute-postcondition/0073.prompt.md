Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least n+1, r is a list containing one element, n is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains no test cases, _ is n, ax is 1000000007, bx is -1, cx is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    a, x = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 1:
        bx = max(x, bx)
    elif a == 2:
        ax = min(x, ax)
    else:
        cx.add(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is at least `n+1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `_` is 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains no test cases. If `a` is 1, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is at least `n+1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a` is an integer assigned the first integer from the input, `x` is an integer assigned the second integer from the input, stdin contains no test cases. If `a` is 1, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is `x` if the condition in the if statement is true, otherwise `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is an empty set if the condition in the if statement is true, otherwise `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is `x` if `x` is greater than -1 and the condition in the if statement is true, otherwise `bx` is -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `ax` is 1000000007 if the condition in the if statement is true, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is `x` if the condition in the if statement is true, otherwise `bx` is -1, and `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x` if the condition in the if statement is false, otherwise `cx` is an empty set.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is at least `n+1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `a` is an integer assigned the first integer from the input, `x` is an integer assigned the second integer from the input, stdin contains no test cases. If `a` is 1, `ax` is either 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing one element which is `x`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is `x` if `x` is greater than -1, otherwise `bx` is -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `ax` is either 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is `x` if `x` is greater than -1, otherwise `bx` is -1, and `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing one element which is `x`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
