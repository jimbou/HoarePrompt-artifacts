Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `x` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `_` is 0, `a` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `bx` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value (-1) and the value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.
