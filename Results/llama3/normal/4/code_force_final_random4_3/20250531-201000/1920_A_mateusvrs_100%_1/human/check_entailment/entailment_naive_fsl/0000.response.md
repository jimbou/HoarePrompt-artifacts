Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It initializes the minimum and maximum possible values of k (bx and ax) and a set to store the values that k cannot be equal to (cx). Then, it iterates over the constraints, updating bx and ax accordingly, and adding the values that k cannot be equal to to cx. Finally, it calculates the number of possible values of k by subtracting the number of values in cx that are within the range [bx, ax] from the total number of values in the range [bx, ax].

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the cases where there are no possible values of k (when bx > ax), and the cases where there are possible values of k but some of them are excluded by the constraints. The program also handles the case where there are multiple constraints of the same type (e.g., multiple constraints of type 1 or type 2).

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
