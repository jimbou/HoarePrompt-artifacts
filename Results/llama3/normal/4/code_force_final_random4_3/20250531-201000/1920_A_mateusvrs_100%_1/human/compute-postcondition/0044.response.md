Output State: **t is at least 1, r is a list containing one element which is ax - bx + 1 - tmp, n is an integer between 2 and 100, _ is n-1, ax is the minimum of all x values where a is 2, bx is the maximum of all x values where a is 1, cx is an empty set, bx is less than or equal to ax, tmp is the number of elements in cx that are within the range of bx and ax (inclusive), stdin contains no test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t remains at least 1. The list r now contains one element which is the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus tmp. The values of n, _, ax, bx, cx, and tmp remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains no test cases.
