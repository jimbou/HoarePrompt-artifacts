Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `_` is 1. If `a` is 1, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is `x`, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is `x` if `x` is greater than -1, otherwise `bx` is -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is `x`, and `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The value of `t` is still at least 1, `r` is still an empty list, `n` is still an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is still an integer, `x` is still an integer, and stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. The value of `_` is still 1. The value of `bx` has been updated to be the maximum of `x` and its previous value. If `a` is 1, `ax` is still 1000000007, `bx` is now `x`, and `cx` is still an empty set. If `a` is 2, `ax` is still the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is now `x` if `x` is greater than -1, otherwise `bx` is still -1, and `cx` is still an empty set. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `ax` is still 1000000007, `bx` is now `x`, and `cx` is still a set containing the integer `x`.
