Postcondition: ***`t` is at least `n+1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `_` is 0, `a` is an integer not equal to 1, `x` is an integer, stdin contains no test cases. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 2, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`.***
