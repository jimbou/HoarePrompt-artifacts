The only variables in the loop head are variables  `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is at least 2, `_` is 2, `t` is at least `n+2`, `x` is an integer, `bx` is -1, `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1000000008 - `tmp`, `i` is not defined, `tmp` is not defined, stdin contains no input. If `a` is 1, then `ax` is 1000000007 and `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 1 or 2, then `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`.**
