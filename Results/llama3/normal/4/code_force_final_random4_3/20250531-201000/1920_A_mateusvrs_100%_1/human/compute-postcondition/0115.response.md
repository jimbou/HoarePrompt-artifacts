Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `_` is 3, `t` is at least `n+2`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1000000008 - `tmp`, `i` is not defined, `tmp` is not defined, `cx` contains `x`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `_`, `t`, `a`, `x`, `r`, `i`, and `tmp` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that `cx` now contains the value of `x`, which was added to it by the `add` method.
