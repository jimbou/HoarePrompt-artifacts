Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `_` is 1, `t` is at least n+2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set, `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1000000008 - tmp, `i` is not defined, `tmp` is not defined, stdin contains no input**

The values of `a` and `x` are updated to be the two integers from the input, but since stdin contains no input, the program will wait for user input to assign values to `a` and `x`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
