Output State: **`t` is at least `n+1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `a` is an integer assigned the first integer from the input, `x` is an integer assigned the second integer from the input, `ax` is either 1000000007, the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, or 1000000007 if the condition in the if statement is true, otherwise the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `bx`, and `cx` is either an empty set, a set containing one element which is `x`, or a set containing one element which is `x` if the condition in the if statement is false, otherwise an empty set, stdin contains no test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The value of `t` is still at least `n+1`, and `r` is still a list containing one element. The value of `n` is still an integer greater than 2, and `_` is still 2. The values of `a` and `x` are still the first and second integers from the input, respectively. The value of `ax` depends on the value of `a` and the condition in the if statement. The value of `bx` is the maximum of `x` and its previous value. The value of `cx` depends on the value of `a` and the condition in the if statement. There are no test cases in the standard input.
