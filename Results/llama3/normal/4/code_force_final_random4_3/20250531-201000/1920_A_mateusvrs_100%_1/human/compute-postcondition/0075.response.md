Output State: **t is at least n+1, n is an integer between 2 and 100, _ is n, a is an integer, x is an integer, r is a list containing one element which is 0, ax is the minimum of x and 1000000007, bx is the maximum of x and -1, and cx is a set containing one element which is x. The current value of bx is higher than the current value of ax.**

In this output state, the list `r` now contains one element, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged, and their values are still valid as per the initial state. The relationship between `ax` and `bx` also remains the same, with `bx` being higher than `ax`.
