To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in cx:`, where `cx` is a set containing one element, which is `x`. For the loop to execute again, `cx` must have at least two elements.

At the end of the previous iteration, `cx` has only one element, which is `x`. To allow the loop to execute again, `cx` must have at least two elements. Let's assume the new element is `y`.

The state of `i` is also affected, as it is the loop variable. Since `i` is now equal to `x`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be equal to `y`.

The other variables in the state (`t`, `r`, `n`, `_`, `a`, `x`, `ax`, `bx`, and `tmp`) are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is at least `n+1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `_` is `n`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is a set containing at least two elements, `i` is equal to `y`, `tmp` is 0**

Note that I've introduced a new variable `y` to represent the new element in the set `cx`. The state of `y` is not explicitly defined, but it is implied to be an integer.
