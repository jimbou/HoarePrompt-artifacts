The code prints the elements of the list `r` separated by newline characters.
Since `r` contains `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` elements where `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that are within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), and `cx` is an empty set, `tmp` is 0.
Also, since `bx > ax` is False, `r` contains `ax - bx + 1` elements.
Output: **t is 0, r is a list containing ax - bx + 1 elements, n is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains no test cases, _ is n-1. ax is the minimum of all x values where a is 2, bx is the maximum of all x values where a is 1, cx is a set containing all x values where a is not 1 or 2. If bx > ax, then r contains 0. Otherwise, r contains ax - bx + 1 - tmp, where tmp is the number of elements in cx that are within the range of bx and ax (inclusive), and cx is an empty set, and the elements of r which are ax - bx + 1 are printed separated by newline characters**
