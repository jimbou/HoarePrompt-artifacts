Output State: **t is at least 1, r is an empty list, n is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains no test cases, _ is n-1. ax is the minimum of all x values where a is 2, bx is the maximum of all x values where a is 1, cx is a set containing all x values where a is not 1 or 2.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the following characteristics:

- The value of `t` remains at least 1.
- The list `r` remains empty.
- The value of `n` remains an integer between 2 and 100.
- The standard input `stdin` will contain no more test cases.
- The loop counter `_` will be equal to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times.
- The value of `ax` will be the minimum of all `x` values encountered when `a` is 2.
- The value of `bx` will be the maximum of all `x` values encountered when `a` is 1.
- The set `cx` will contain all `x` values encountered when `a` is not 1 or 2.
