Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `_` is 2, `t` is at least `n+2`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1000000008 - `tmp`, `i` is not defined, `tmp` is not defined, `ax` is either 1000000007, the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, or the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing one element which is `x`.**

In this output state, the value of `bx` has been updated to be the maximum of `x` and -1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `bx` is now dependent on the value of `x`, and it will be either `x` if `x` is greater than -1, or -1 if `x` is less than or equal to -1.
