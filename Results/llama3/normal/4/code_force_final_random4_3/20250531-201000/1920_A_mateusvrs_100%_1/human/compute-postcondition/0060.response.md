Output State: **`t` is at least `n+1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is assigned the first integer from the input, `x` is assigned the second integer from the input, stdin contains no test cases. If `a` is 1, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `r`, `n`, and `_` remain the same. The values of `a` and `x` are updated to the first and second integers from the input, respectively. The conditions for `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` are still dependent on the value of `a`.
