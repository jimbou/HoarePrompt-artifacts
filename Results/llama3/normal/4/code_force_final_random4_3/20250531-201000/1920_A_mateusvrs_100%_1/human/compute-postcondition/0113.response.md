Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `_` is 3, `t` is at least `n+2`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1000000008 - `tmp`, `i` is not defined, `tmp` is not defined, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `_`, `t`, `a`, `x`, `r`, `i`, and `tmp` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is in the value of `bx`, which is now the maximum of `x` and its previous value.
