Output State: **`t` is at least `n+1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `_` is 0, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains no test cases**

The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` assigns the values of two integers from the input to the variables `a` and `x`. Since the stdin contains no test cases, the input is expected to be a space-separated list of two integers. The values of the other variables are not affected. The output state includes the updated values of `a` and `x`, which are now integers, and the unchanged values of the other variables.
