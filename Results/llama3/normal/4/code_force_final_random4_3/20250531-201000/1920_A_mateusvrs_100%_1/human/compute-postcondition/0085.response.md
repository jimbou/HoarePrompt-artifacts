The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and cx, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cx.  If the set cx has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, cx has at least 2 elements, i is equal to y. So for the loop to be executed one more time the set cx must have at least 3 elements and the i is equal to the next element in the set cx.
State: **`t` is at least `n+1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `_` is `n`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is a set containing at least three elements, `i` is equal to the next element in the set cx. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax`, then `tmp` is 1, otherwise `tmp` remains 0.**
