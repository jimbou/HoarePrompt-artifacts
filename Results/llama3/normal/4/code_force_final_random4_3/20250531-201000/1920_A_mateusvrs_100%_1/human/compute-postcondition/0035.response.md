Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `_` is n-1, `ax` is the minimum of all x values where a is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all x values where a is 1, `cx` is a set containing all x values where a is not 1 or 2 and must have at least 1 element, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is 1, the current value of `i` is the first element in the set `cx` and `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), stdin contains no test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and their properties and relationships are still valid. The stdin still contains no test cases.
