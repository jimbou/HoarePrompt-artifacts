To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is already an integer between 2 and 100, it meets this condition. However, to make the loop execute at least once, we need to adjust `_` to be 0, which is the initial value of the loop variable.

State: **t is at least n+1, r is a list containing one element, n is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains no test cases, _ is 0, ax is 1000000007, bx is -1, cx is an empty set**
