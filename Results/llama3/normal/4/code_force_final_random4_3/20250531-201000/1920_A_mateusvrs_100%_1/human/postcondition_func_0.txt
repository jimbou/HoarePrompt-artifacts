This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer n followed by n lines of two integers a and x. It then processes each test case by finding the maximum x value where a is 1, the minimum x value where a is 2, and the set of x values where a is neither 1 nor 2. If the maximum x value where a is 1 is greater than the minimum x value where a is 2, it appends 0 to the result list. Otherwise, it appends the difference between the minimum x value where a is 2 and the maximum x value where a is 1, plus 1, minus the number of x values in the set that are within the range of the maximum x value where a is 1 and the minimum x value where a is 2 (inclusive). Finally, it prints the result list, with each element on a new line.
