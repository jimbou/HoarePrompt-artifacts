Postcondition: ***`n` is 0, `_` is 0, `t` is at least 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is a set that must have at least 1 element, `tmp` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the first element in the set `cx`, and stdin contains no input, and `bx` is not larger than `ax`. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (i.e., `i` is greater than or equal to -1 and less than or equal to 1000000007), then `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1000000007. Otherwise, `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1000000008 - `tmp`.***
