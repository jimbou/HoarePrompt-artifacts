To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(n):`.

The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `n`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, we don't need to worry about its state. The state of `n` is already given as an integer between 2 and 100.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `_` needs to be incremented by 1. Since `_` is not used anywhere in the loop body, we can simply increment its value without affecting the rest of the program state.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables `t`, `r`, `a`, `x`, `ax`, `bx`, `cx`, and `stdin` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is at least 1, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `_` is 2**
