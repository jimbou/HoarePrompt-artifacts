According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cx`. If `cx` has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 0, `_` is 0, `t` is at least 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set, `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1000000008 - `tmp`, `tmp` is 0, `i` is not defined, and stdin contains no input, and `bx` is not larger than `ax`. So for the loop to be executed  the set `cx` must have at least 1 element and the variable `i` is the first element in the set `cx`.
State: **`n` is 0, `_` is 0, `t` is at least 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is a set that must have at least 1 element, `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1000000008 - `tmp`, `tmp` is 0, `i` is the first element in the set `cx`, and stdin contains no input, and `bx` is not larger than `ax`**
