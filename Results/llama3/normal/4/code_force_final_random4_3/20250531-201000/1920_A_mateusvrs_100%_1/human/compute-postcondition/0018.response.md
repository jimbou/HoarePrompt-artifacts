Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `_` is 1. If `a` is 1, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`.**

In this output state, the value of `cx` has been updated to include the integer `x`, regardless of the value of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
