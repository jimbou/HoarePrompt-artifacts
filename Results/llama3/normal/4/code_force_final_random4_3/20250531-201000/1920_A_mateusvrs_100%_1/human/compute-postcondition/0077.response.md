Output State: **`t` is at least `n+1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `_` is `n`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `tmp` is 0, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`, and `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`.**

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `tmp` and assigned it the value 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and relationships between the variables, such as `t` being at least `n+1`, `n` being between 2 and 100, and `bx` being less than or equal to `ax`, are still valid.
