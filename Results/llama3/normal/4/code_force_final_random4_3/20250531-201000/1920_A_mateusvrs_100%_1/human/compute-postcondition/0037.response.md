To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and how it changes from the previous iteration. The loop head is `for i in cx:`, where `cx` is a set containing all x values where a is not 1 or 2 and must have at least 1 element.

Given that `cx` must have at least 1 element and the loop has already executed once, we can infer that `cx` has more than one element for the loop to execute again. Since `i` is an element of `cx`, and assuming the loop iterates over the elements of `cx` in some order (though the specific order is not defined for sets), for the loop to execute again, `cx` must have at least one more element after `i`.

The state of other variables (`t`, `r`, `n`, `_`, `ax`, `bx`, and `tmp`) does not directly influence the loop's ability to execute again, as the loop's continuation is solely based on the elements in `cx`. However, the relationship between `bx` and `ax` and the potential range of `i` (or the next element in `cx`) is noted but does not affect the loop's execution directly in terms of the loop head variables.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the state of `cx`, indicating it must have at least one more element than previously, and the state of `i`, which would be the next element in `cx` if the loop were to continue.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `_` is n-1, `ax` is the minimum of all x values where a is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all x values where a is 1, `cx` is a set containing all x values where a is not 1 or 2 and must have at least 2 elements, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, stdin contains no test cases. If the next element `i` in the set `cx` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), then `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and `i` is the next element in `cx`.**
