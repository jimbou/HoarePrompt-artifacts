Output State: **`t` is at least `n+1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a` is an integer assigned the first integer from the input, `x` is an integer assigned the second integer from the input, stdin contains no test cases. If `a` is 1, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`.**

In this output state, the value of `ax` has been updated to be the minimum of `x` and its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ax` now depends on the value of `a` and `x`. If `a` is 1 or 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `ax` is also the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. The values of `bx` and `cx` remain the same as in the initial state.
