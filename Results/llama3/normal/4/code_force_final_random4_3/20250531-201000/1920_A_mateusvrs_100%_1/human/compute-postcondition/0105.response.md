Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `_` is 2, `t` is at least `n+2`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `bx` is -1, `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1000000008 - `tmp`, `i` is not defined, `tmp` is not defined, `ax` is either 1000000007, the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, or the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing one element which is `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The values of `n`, `_`, `t`, `bx`, `r`, `i`, and `tmp` remain unchanged. The variables `a` and `x` are assigned integer values from the input. The value of `ax` depends on the value of `a`: if `a` is 1, then `ax` is the maximum of `x` and -1; if `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007; otherwise, `ax` is 1000000007. The value of `cx` is also dependent on `a`: if `a` is 1 or 2, then `cx` is an empty set; otherwise, `cx` is a set containing one element, which is `x`.
