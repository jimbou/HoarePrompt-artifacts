The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is `n-1`, `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 and `t` must be greater than `_`. So `_` is `n` and `t` is at least `n+1`.
State: **`t` is at least n+1, `r` is a list containing one element, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `stdin` contains no test cases, `_` is n, `ax` is the minimum of all x values where a is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all x values where a is 1, `cx` is a set containing all x values where a is not 1 or 2. If `bx` > `ax`, then `r` contains 0. Otherwise, `r` contains `ax` - `bx` + 1 - `tmp`, where `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that are within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), and `cx` is an empty set.**
