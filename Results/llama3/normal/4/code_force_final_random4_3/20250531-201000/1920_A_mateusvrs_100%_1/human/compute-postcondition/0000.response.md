The code reads the number of test cases from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. It then initializes an empty list `r`. The output state includes the number of test cases `t` and the empty list `r`, as well as the remaining test cases in the standard input.

Output State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases, r is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n lines, each containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9).**
