Output State: **`n` is 0, `_` is 0, `t` is at least 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is a set that must have at least 2 elements, `tmp` is 1, `i` is the second element in the set `cx`, and if `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (i.e., `i` is greater than or equal to -1 and less than or equal to 1000000007), then `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1000000007. Otherwise, `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1000000008 - 1, stdin contains no input, and `bx` is not larger than `ax`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `tmp` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The set `cx` still has at least 2 elements, and `i` is still the second element in this set. The list `r` still depends on the value of `i` and the range defined by `bx` and `ax`.
