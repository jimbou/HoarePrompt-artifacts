Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `_` is 1, `t` is at least `n+2`, `x` is an integer, `bx` is -1, `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1000000008 - `tmp`, `i` is not defined, `tmp` is not defined, stdin contains no input. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 2, then `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`.***
