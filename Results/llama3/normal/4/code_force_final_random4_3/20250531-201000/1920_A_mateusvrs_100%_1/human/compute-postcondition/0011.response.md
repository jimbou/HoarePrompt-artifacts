Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an integer not equal to 1 and not equal to 2, `x` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `_` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `cx` has been updated to include the integer `x`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The set `cx` now contains at least one element, which is the integer `x`. The rest of the variables maintain their initial values and properties.
