Output State: **`t` is at least `n+1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `_` is `n`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is a set containing at least three elements, `i` is equal to the last element in the set cx. If all elements in `cx` are within the range of `bx` and `ax`, then `tmp` is equal to the number of elements in `cx`. Otherwise, `tmp` is less than the number of elements in `cx`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables not affected by the loop head and body remain unchanged. The set `cx` contains at least three elements, and the variable `i` is equal to the last element in the set `cx`. The value of `tmp` depends on whether all elements in `cx` are within the range of `bx` and `ax`. If all elements are within this range, then `tmp` is equal to the number of elements in `cx`. Otherwise, `tmp` is less than the number of elements in `cx`, indicating that some elements in `cx` are outside the range of `bx` and `ax`.
