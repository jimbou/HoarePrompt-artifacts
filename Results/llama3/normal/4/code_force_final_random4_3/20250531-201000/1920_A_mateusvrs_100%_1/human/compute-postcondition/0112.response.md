Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `_` is 3, `t` is at least `n+2`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1000000008 - `tmp`, `i` is not defined, `tmp` is not defined. `a` and `x` are assigned the values from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin contains a space-separated list of integers. The values of the other variables are not affected. since stdin is now empty we wont include it in the output state.**

In natural language, the output state is: `n` is at least 3, `_` is 3, `t` is at least `n+2`, `a` and `x` are assigned the integer values from the input, `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1000000008 - `tmp`, `i` is not defined, `tmp` is not defined.
