Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, r is a list containing one element, n is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains no test cases, _ is n-1. ax is the minimum of all x values where a is 2, bx is the maximum of all x values where a is 1, cx is a set containing all x values where a is not 1 or 2. If bx > ax, then r contains 0. Otherwise, r contains ax - bx + 1 - tmp, where tmp is the number of elements in cx that are within the range of bx and ax (inclusive), and cx is an empty set.***
