Postcondition: ***`n` is 0, `_` is 0, `t` is at least 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is 1000000007. If `bx` is greater than 1000000007, `bx` is greater than 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set, `r` is a list containing three elements, the first element is 0, the second element is 1000000008 - `tmp`, and the third element is 0, `i` is not defined, `tmp` is not defined, and stdin contains no input. Otherwise, `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set, `tmp` is 0, `i` is not defined, `r` is a list containing three elements, the first element is 0, the second element is 1000000007, and the third element is 1000000008, and stdin contains no input.***
