Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `_` is n-1, `ax` is the minimum of all x values where a is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all x values where a is 1, `cx` is a set containing all x values where a is not 1 or 2 and must have at least 3 elements, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`. If the next element `i` in the set `cx` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), then `tmp` is 3. Otherwise, `tmp` is 2, and `i` is the next element in `cx`.***
