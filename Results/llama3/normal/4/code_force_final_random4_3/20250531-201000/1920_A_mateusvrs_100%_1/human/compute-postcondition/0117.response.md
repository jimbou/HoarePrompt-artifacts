Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `_` is 3, `t` is at least `n+2`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1000000008 - `tmp`, `i` is not defined, `tmp` is not defined. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the previous value of `ax`. If `a` is not 1 or 2, then `cx` contains `x`.***
