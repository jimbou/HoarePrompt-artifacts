Output State: **t is 0, r is a list containing t elements, n is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains no test cases, _ is n-1. ax is the minimum of all x values where a is 2, bx is the maximum of all x values where a is 1, cx is a set containing all x values where a is not 1 or 2. If bx > ax, then r contains 0. Otherwise, r contains ax - bx + 1 - tmp, where tmp is the number of elements in cx that are within the range of bx and ax (inclusive), and cx is an empty set.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the number of test cases (t) is 0, the result list (r) contains t elements, the number of lines in each test case (n) is an integer between 2 and 100, there are no more test cases in the standard input (stdin), and the loop counter (_) is n-1. The minimum and maximum values of x where a is 2 and 1 respectively (ax and bx) are updated, and the set of x values where a is not 1 or 2 (cx) is empty. If bx is greater than ax, the result list contains 0, otherwise it contains the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of elements in cx that are within the range of bx and ax (inclusive).
