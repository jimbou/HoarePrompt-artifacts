Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 1, r is an empty list, n is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains no test cases, _ is n-1, ax is the minimum of all x values where a is 2, bx is the maximum of all x values where a is 1, cx is a set containing all x values where a is not 1 or 2, bx is less than or equal to ax, tmp is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in cx:
    if i >= bx and i <= ax:
        tmp += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is at least 1, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `_` is n-1, `ax` is the minimum of all x values where a is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all x values where a is 1, `cx` is a set containing all x values where a is not 1 or 2 and must have at least 1 element, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, stdin contains no test cases. If the first element `i` in the set `cx` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), then `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is at least 1, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `_` is n-1, `ax` is the minimum of all x values where a is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all x values where a is 1, `cx` is a set containing all x values where a is not 1 or 2 and must have at least 2 elements, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`. If the next element `i` in the set `cx` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), then `tmp` is 2. Otherwise, `tmp` is 1, and `i` is the next element in `cx`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is at least 1, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `_` is n-1, `ax` is the minimum of all x values where a is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all x values where a is 1, `cx` is a set containing all x values where a is not 1 or 2 and must have at least 3 elements, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`. If the next element `i` in the set `cx` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), then `tmp` is 3. Otherwise, `tmp` is 2, and `i` is the next element in `cx`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
