Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of s.

The program uses the fact that repeating the first k characters of the alphabet 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' n times will result in a string that contains all possible subsequences of length n. This is because each character in the string is repeated n times, ensuring that every possible combination of characters appears as a subsequence.

The program defines a function func_1() that takes two integers n and k as input, and returns the string s. The string s is constructed by taking the first k characters of the alphabet and repeating them n times.

The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected, accepting two positive integers n and k as input and returning a string consisting of the first k characters of the alphabet repeated n times.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
