Output State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 26, k is a positive integer between 1 and 26, s is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin is empty**

The code first reads two positive integers n and k from stdin, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and assigns them to the variables n and k, respectively. This operation empties stdin. Then, it assigns the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' to the variable s. No other variables are affected.
