Reasoning:

The problem requires finding a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. The program provided attempts to solve this problem by repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k` and calls the function `func_1`.
3. The function `func_1` generates a string `s` by repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times using the expression `s[:k] * n`.
4. The function returns the generated string `s`.

The program's approach is correct because repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times ensures that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using these alphabets occur as a subsequence of the generated string `s`.

For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the generated string `s` would be `"abab"`, which contains all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets (`"aa"`, `"ab"`, `"ba"`, and `"bb"`).

Therefore, the program is correct, and the output will be as expected.

Correctness: **True**
