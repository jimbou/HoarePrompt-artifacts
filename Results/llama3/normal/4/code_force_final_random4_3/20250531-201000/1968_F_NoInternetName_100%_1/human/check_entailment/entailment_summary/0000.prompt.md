Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

# Functions with Execution Summary:
from collections import defaultdict

if __name__ == '__main__':
    (t,) = func_1(int)
    for _ in range(t):
        func_5()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(cast):
    return map(cast, input().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  This function takes a string of space-separated values as input, applies a specified casting function to each value, and returns a map object containing the casted values.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(arr, predicate):
    (l, r) = (0, len(arr))
    while l + 1 < r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if predicate(arr[mid]):
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    if predicate(arr[l]):
        return l
    return None
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  This function performs a binary search on a list `arr` using a given predicate function. It returns the index of the first element in the list for which the predicate is true, or None if no such element exists. The function assumes that the predicate function is monotonic, meaning that if it returns true for an element, it will also return true for all subsequent elements. The function modifies the input list `arr` in place, but only in terms of the indices `l` and `r` used for the binary search. The final state of the program is that the function returns either the index of the first element satisfying the predicate, or None if no such element exists.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(arr, predicate):
    return func_2(arr, predicate)
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  Filters a list of elements based on a predicate function and returns the filtered list. The function takes a list 'arr' and a predicate function as input, applies the predicate function to each element in the list, and returns a new list containing only the elements for which the predicate function returns True.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(arr, predicate):
    result = func_2(arr, predicate)
    if result is not None:
        return result + 1
    return None
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  This function takes a list of elements and a predicate function as input, calls another function (`func_2`) with these inputs, and returns the result of that call plus one if it's not None, otherwise returns None.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    (n, q) = func_1(int)
    a = list(func_1(int))
    x = [0]
    inds = defaultdict(list)
    inds[0].append(0)
    for i in a:
        x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
        inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)
    for i in range(q):
        (l, r) = func_1(int)
        if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
            print('Yes')
            continue
        lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]
        upper = inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]
        if upper > lower:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  This function takes no arguments and returns no values. It performs the following actions: 

1. It generates a positive integer `n` and a positive integer `q` by calling the function `func_1` with an integer argument. 
2. It generates a list `a` of non-negative integers less than 2^30 by calling the function `func_1` with an integer argument. 
3. It creates a list `x` containing `len(a) + 1` elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the last element of `x` and each element of `a`. 
4. It creates a dictionary `inds` where the keys are the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and each element of `a`, and the values are lists containing the indices of the corresponding elements in `x`. 
5. It iterates `q` times, and in each iteration, it generates two integers `l` and `r` by calling the function `func_1` with an integer argument. 
6. If `x[l - 1]` is equal to `x[r]`, it prints 'Yes' and continues to the next iteration. 
7. Otherwise, it finds the lower and upper bounds of the range `[l, r]` in the list `inds[x[r]]` and `inds[x[l - 1]]` respectively, using the functions `func_4` and `func_3`. 
8. If the upper bound is greater than the lower bound, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'. 

The function does not modify any input variables and does not return any values. Its purpose is to perform a series of bitwise XOR operations and range queries, and print the results.
