Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is at least 1, `a` is an empty list, `func_1` is a function that returns a list of integers, `func_4` is a function that returns an index, `func_3` is a function that returns an index, `x` is a list containing 1 element: 0, `inds` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 0, `l` and `r` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(int)`, which is a list of integers. The current value of `x[l - 1]` is equal to the current value of `x[r]`, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration due to the `continue` statement. The `continue` statement does not affect the values of any variables, but it changes the control flow of the program by skipping the rest of the current iteration and moving on to the next one.
