Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It first calculates the prefix XOR of the array and stores the indices of each XOR value in a dictionary. Then, for each query, it checks if the subarray is interesting by checking if the XOR of the subarray is equal to the XOR of any previous subarray. If it is, then the subarray is interesting and the program prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

The program correctly handles all edge cases, including when the subarray is empty, when the subarray has only one element, and when the subarray has multiple elements. It also correctly handles the case when the XOR of the subarray is equal to the XOR of a previous subarray.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program is correct and should work for all possible inputs.
