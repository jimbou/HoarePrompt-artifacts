Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a given subarray is interesting, i.e., whether it can be divided into k>1 parts such that the bitwise XOR of values from each part are equal.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases, the number of elements in the array, and the number of queries.
2. It then reads the array elements and calculates the cumulative XOR of the array, storing it in the `x` list.
3. The program uses a dictionary `inds` to store the indices of the cumulative XOR values. This allows for efficient lookup of the indices where a particular XOR value occurs.
4. For each query, the program checks if the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r` is equal to the XOR of the entire array. If it is, the subarray is interesting, and the program prints "Yes".
5. If the XOR of the subarray is not equal to the XOR of the entire array, the program checks if there exists a partition point within the subarray such that the XOR of the subarray from `l` to the partition point is equal to the XOR of the subarray from the partition point to `r`. This is done by finding the lower and upper bounds of the indices where the XOR value `x[r]` occurs in the `inds` dictionary.
6. If the upper bound is greater than the lower bound, it means that there exists a partition point within the subarray, and the program prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

The program uses binary search to find the lower and upper bounds of the indices where the XOR value `x[r]` occurs in the `inds` dictionary. This is done using the `func_2` and `func_3` functions, which implement binary search.

Overall, the program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
