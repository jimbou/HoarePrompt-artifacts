This function performs a binary search on a list `arr` using a given predicate function. It returns the index of the first element in the list for which the predicate is true, or None if no such element exists. The function assumes that the predicate function is monotonic, meaning that if it returns true for an element, it will also return true for all subsequent elements. The function modifies the input list `arr` in place, but only in terms of the indices `l` and `r` used for the binary search. The final state of the program is that the function returns either the index of the first element satisfying the predicate, or None if no such element exists.
