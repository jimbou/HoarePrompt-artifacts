Output: **n is a positive integer, q is at least 2, a is a list, func_1 is a function that returns a list of integers, func_4 is a function that returns an index, func_3 is a function that returns an index, x is a list containing 1 element: 0, inds is a dictionary with updated values, i is 2, l and r are assigned the values returned by func_1(int), lower is the value of inds[x[r]] at the index returned by func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0, upper is the value of inds[x[l - 1]] at the index returned by func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r), and 'Yes' is printed**
