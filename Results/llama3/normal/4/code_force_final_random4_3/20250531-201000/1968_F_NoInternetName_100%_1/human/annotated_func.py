#State of the program right berfore the function call: cast is a function that takes a string and returns a value of a specific type, and input() is a function that returns a string of space-separated values.
    return map(cast, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that applies the cast function to each string in the input, where the input is a string of space-separated values and the cast function returns a value of a specific type.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a string of space-separated values as input, applies a specified casting function to each value, and returns a map object containing the casted values.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements of any type and predicate is a function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value.
    l, r = 0, len(arr)

    return None
    #The program returns None

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a binary search on a list `arr` using a given predicate function. It returns the index of the first element in the list for which the predicate is true, or None if no such element exists. The function assumes that the predicate function is monotonic, meaning that if it returns true for an element, it will also return true for all subsequent elements. The function modifies the input list `arr` in place, but only in terms of the indices `l` and `r` used for the binary search. The final state of the program is that the function returns either the index of the first element satisfying the predicate, or None if no such element exists.

    return func_2(arr, predicate)
    #The program returns the result of applying the func_2 function to the list 'arr' and the predicate function, where the predicate function is applied to each element in 'arr' to filter the elements based on the boolean value returned by the predicate function.

#Overall this is what the function does:Filters a list of elements based on a predicate function and returns the filtered list. The function takes a list 'arr' and a predicate function as input, applies the predicate function to each element in the list, and returns a new list containing only the elements for which the predicate function returns True.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements of any type and predicate is a function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value.
    result = func_2(arr, predicate)

    #State: *`arr` is a list of elements of any type, `predicate` is a function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value, `result` is the value returned by `func_2(arr, predicate)`, and `result` is `None`
    return None
    #The program returns None

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of elements and a predicate function as input, calls another function (`func_2`) with these inputs, and returns the result of that call plus one if it's not None, otherwise returns None.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, and func_1 and func_4 are functions that return a list of integers and an index respectively, and func_3 is a function that returns an index.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes no arguments and returns no values. It performs the following actions: 

1. It generates a positive integer `n` and a positive integer `q` by calling the function `func_1` with an integer argument. 
2. It generates a list `a` of non-negative integers less than 2^30 by calling the function `func_1` with an integer argument. 
3. It creates a list `x` containing `len(a) + 1` elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the last element of `x` and each element of `a`. 
4. It creates a dictionary `inds` where the keys are the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and each element of `a`, and the values are lists containing the indices of the corresponding elements in `x`. 
5. It iterates `q` times, and in each iteration, it generates two integers `l` and `r` by calling the function `func_1` with an integer argument. 
6. If `x[l - 1]` is equal to `x[r]`, it prints 'Yes' and continues to the next iteration. 
7. Otherwise, it finds the lower and upper bounds of the range `[l, r]` in the list `inds[x[r]]` and `inds[x[l - 1]]` respectively, using the functions `func_4` and `func_3`. 
8. If the upper bound is greater than the lower bound, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'. 

The function does not modify any input variables and does not return any values. Its purpose is to perform a series of bitwise XOR operations and range queries, and print the results.
