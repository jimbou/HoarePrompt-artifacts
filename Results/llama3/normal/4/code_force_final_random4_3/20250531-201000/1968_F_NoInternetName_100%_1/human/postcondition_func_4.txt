This function takes no arguments and returns no values. It performs the following actions: 

1. It generates a positive integer `n` and a positive integer `q` by calling the function `func_1` with an integer argument. 
2. It generates a list `a` of non-negative integers less than 2^30 by calling the function `func_1` with an integer argument. 
3. It creates a list `x` containing `len(a) + 1` elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the last element of `x` and each element of `a`. 
4. It creates a dictionary `inds` where the keys are the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and each element of `a`, and the values are lists containing the indices of the corresponding elements in `x`. 
5. It iterates `q` times, and in each iteration, it generates two integers `l` and `r` by calling the function `func_1` with an integer argument. 
6. If `x[l - 1]` is equal to `x[r]`, it prints 'Yes' and continues to the next iteration. 
7. Otherwise, it finds the lower and upper bounds of the range `[l, r]` in the list `inds[x[r]]` and `inds[x[l - 1]]` respectively, using the functions `func_4` and `func_3`. 
8. If the upper bound is greater than the lower bound, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'. 

The function does not modify any input variables and does not return any values. Its purpose is to perform a series of bitwise XOR operations and range queries, and print the results.
