Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n and q are positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, func_1 and func_4 are functions that return a list of integers and an index respectively, and func_3 is a function that returns an index, x is a list containing a single element 0, inds is a dictionary with a single key 0 and a list containing a single element 0
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
    inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30 that must have at least 1 element, func_1 is a function that returns a list of integers, func_4 is a function that returns an index, func_3 is a function that returns an index, x is a list containing two elements: 0 and the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and the first element of a, inds is a dictionary with a single key equal to the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and the first element of a, and a list containing two elements: 0 and the index of the second element in x.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30 that must have at least 2 elements, func_1 is a function that returns a list of integers, func_4 is a function that returns an index, func_3 is a function that returns an index, x is a list containing three elements: 0, the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and the second element of a, and the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the second element of x and the second element of a, inds is a dictionary with a single key equal to the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and the second element of a, and a list containing three elements: 0, the index of the second element in x, and the index of the third element in x, i is the second element of a.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30 that must have at least 3 elements, func_1 is a function that returns a list of integers, func_4 is a function that returns an index, func_3 is a function that returns an index, x is a list containing four elements: 0, the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and the second element of a, the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the second element of x and the second element of a, and the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the third element of x and the third element of a, inds is a dictionary with a single key equal to the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and the second element of a, and a list containing four elements: 0, the index of the second element in x, the index of the third element in x, and the index of the fourth element in x, i is the third element of a




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
