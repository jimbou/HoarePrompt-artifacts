Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is at least 1, `a` is an empty list, `func_1` is a function that returns a list of integers, `func_4` is a function that returns an index, `func_3` is a function that returns an index, `x` is a list containing 1 element: 0, `inds` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 0, `l` and `r` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(int)`, which is a list of integers. The current value of `x[l - 1]` is equal to the current value of `x[r]`.**
