Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is at least 2, `a` is a list, `func_1` is a function that returns a list of integers, `func_4` is a function that returns an index, `func_3` is a function that returns an index, `x` is a list containing 1 element: 0, `inds` is a dictionary with updated values, `i` is 1, `l` and `r` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the value of `inds[x[r]]` at the index returned by `func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l)` or 0, `upper` is the value of `inds[x[l - 1]]` at the index returned by `func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)`**.

In this output state, the values of `l` and `r` have been updated to the values returned by the function `func_1` when called with the argument `int`. The other variables remain unchanged.
