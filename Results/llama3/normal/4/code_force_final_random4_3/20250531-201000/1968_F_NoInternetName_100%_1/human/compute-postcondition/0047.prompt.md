Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is an empty list, func_1 is a function that returns a list of integers, func_4 is a function that returns an index, func_3 is a function that returns an index, x is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the last element of x and each element of a, inds is a dictionary with len(a) keys equal to the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and each element of a, and a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the index of each element in x, i is the last element of a.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(q):
    l, r = func_1(int)
    if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
        print('Yes')
        continue
    lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]
    upper = inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]
    if upper > lower:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer, q is at least 1, a is an empty list, func_1 is a function that returns a list of integers, func_4 is a function that returns an index, func_3 is a function that returns an index, x is a list containing 1 element: 0, inds is a dictionary with updated values, i is 0, l and r are assigned the values returned by func_1(int), lower is the value of inds[x[r]] at the index returned by func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0, upper is the value of inds[x[l - 1]] at the index returned by func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r). If the current value of upper is higher than the current value of lower, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is a positive integer, q is at least 2, a is a list, func_1 is a function that returns a list of integers, func_4 is a function that returns an index, func_3 is a function that returns an index, x is a list containing 1 element: 0, inds is a dictionary with updated values, i is 1, l and r are assigned the values returned by func_1(int), lower is the value of inds[x[r]] at the index returned by func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0, upper is the value of inds[x[l - 1]] at the index returned by func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r). If upper is greater than lower, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is a positive integer, q is at least 2, a is a list, func_1 is a function that returns a list of integers, func_4 is a function that returns an index, func_3 is a function that returns an index, x is a list containing 1 element: 0, inds is a dictionary with updated values, i is 2, l and r are assigned the values returned by func_1(int), lower is the value of inds[x[r]] at the index returned by func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0, upper is the value of inds[x[l - 1]] at the index returned by func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r). If upper is greater than lower, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
