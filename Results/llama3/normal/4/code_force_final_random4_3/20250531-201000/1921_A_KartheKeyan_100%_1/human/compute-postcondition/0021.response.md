Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 2, coord is a list containing three tuples (x, y), (x, y), and (x, y), res is 0, p1 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first tuples, p2 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third tuples, i is 2, x is an integer, y is an integer, stdin contains t-8 testcases, range is at least 1**

The code block reads two integers from the input and appends them as a tuple to the `coord` list. The values of `n`, `res`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, and `range` remain unchanged. The values of `x` and `y` are updated to the newly read integers. The number of test cases in `stdin` decreases by 1.
