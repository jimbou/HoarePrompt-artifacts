Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 1, coord is a list containing a tuple of two integers and the newly added tuple (x, y), res is 0, stdin contains t-4 testcases, i is less than 4, x is an integer, y is an integer**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to x and y. Since stdin contains t-3 testcases, after reading two integers, it will contain t-4 testcases. The second line appends the tuple (x, y) to the list coord. The initial state of coord is a list containing a tuple of two integers, so after appending (x, y), it will contain two tuples of two integers.

The values of n, res, and i are not affected by the code block, so they remain the same. The value of x and y are updated to the newly read integers.
