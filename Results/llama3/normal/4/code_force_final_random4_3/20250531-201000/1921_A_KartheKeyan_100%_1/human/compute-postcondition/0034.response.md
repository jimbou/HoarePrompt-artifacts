Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 3, coord is a list containing three tuples of two integers, res is 0, p1 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first tuples, p2 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third tuples, i is 2, x is an integer, y is an integer, stdin contains t-13 testcases, range is at least 1, and the rounded value of res is being printed**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to x and y. The second line appends a tuple containing x and y to the coord list. 

The initial state of coord is a list containing two tuples of two integers. After the code executes, coord will contain three tuples of two integers. The values of x and y are updated to the integers read from stdin. The number of testcases in stdin is reduced by 1. No other variables are affected.
