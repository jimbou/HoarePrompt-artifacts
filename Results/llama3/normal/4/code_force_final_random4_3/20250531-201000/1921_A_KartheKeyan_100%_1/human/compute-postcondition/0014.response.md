According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer greater than -1 and equal to its original value minus 2. Since `n` is greater than -1, it can be 0, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 2, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, `res` is the square root of the product of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first tuples and the fourth and third tuples, `p1` is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first tuples, `p2` is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third tuples, `i` is equal to 4, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, stdin contains t-5 testcases, and the rounded value of `res` is being printed.**
