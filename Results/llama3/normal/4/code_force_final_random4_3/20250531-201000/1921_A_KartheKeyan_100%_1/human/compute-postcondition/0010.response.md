Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 1, coord is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, res is the square root of the product of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first tuples and the fourth and third tuples, p1 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first tuples, p2 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third tuples, i is equal to 4, x is an integer, y is an integer, stdin contains t-4 testcases.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The `coord` list is sorted in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple, and then by the second element if the first elements are equal. The `res` variable is calculated as the square root of the product of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first tuples (`p1`) and the fourth and third tuples (`p2`). The values of `p1` and `p2` are calculated as the squared differences between the coordinates of the respective tuples. The values of `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains `t-4` as no input is read or written during the execution of the code.
