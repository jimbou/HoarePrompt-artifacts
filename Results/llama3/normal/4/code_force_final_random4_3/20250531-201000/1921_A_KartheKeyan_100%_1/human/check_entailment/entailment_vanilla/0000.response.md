Reasoning:

1. The problem statement requires finding the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. The square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, and the area is strictly greater than 0.

2. The provided Python program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.

3. For each test case, the program reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square, sorts them, and calculates the distances between the points.

4. The program calculates the area of the square by multiplying the square roots of the distances between the points.

5. The program prints the calculated area for each test case.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

* The program does not handle invalid inputs. If the input is not in the correct format or if the coordinates do not form a square, the program may produce incorrect results or crash.

* The program uses the `math.sqrt()` function to calculate the square root of the distances. This is unnecessary, as the area of the square can be calculated directly from the distances.

* The program uses the `round()` function to round the calculated area to the nearest integer. This is not necessary, as the area of the square is always an integer.

* The program does not follow the problem statement's requirement to print the area of the square as a single integer. Instead, it prints the area as a floating-point number.

Correctness: **False**
