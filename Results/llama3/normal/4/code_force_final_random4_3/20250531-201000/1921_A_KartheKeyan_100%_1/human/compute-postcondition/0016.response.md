To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the range `4`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range `4`. If the range is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `i` is already equal to 4, we need to adjust the range to be at least 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 2, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `p1` is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first tuples, `p2` is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third tuples, `i` is 0, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `stdin` contains t-5 testcases, range is at least 1**
