Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 3, coord is a list containing one tuple of two integers, res is 0, p1 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first tuples, p2 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third tuples, i is 0, x is an integer, y is an integer, stdin contains t-11 testcases, range is at least 1, and the rounded value of res is being printed**

In this output state, the code has executed the given block of code, and the variables have been updated accordingly. The variable `coord` now contains a tuple of two integers, which were read from the input. The variables `x` and `y` have been assigned the values of the two integers read from the input. The variable `n` remains unchanged, as it was not modified by the code. The variables `res`, `p1`, `p2`, and `i` also remain unchanged, as they were not modified by the code. The variable `stdin` now contains `t-11` testcases, as one testcase has been read and processed. The variable `range` remains unchanged, as it was not modified by the code. The rounded value of `res` is still being printed, as the code did not modify this behavior.
