To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the state of the variable `n` in the loop head. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is not zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, and stdin contains t-1 testcases. 

For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 0. Since `n` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, the original value of `n` must be greater than 1. 

State: **n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 1, stdin contains t-1 testcases.**
