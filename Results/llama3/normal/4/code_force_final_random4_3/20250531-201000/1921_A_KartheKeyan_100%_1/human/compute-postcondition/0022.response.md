Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 2, coord is a list containing four tuples (x, y), (x, y), (x, y), and (x, y), res is 0, p1 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first tuples, p2 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third tuples, i is 3, x is an integer, y is an integer, stdin contains t-9 testcases, range is at least 1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `coord` now contains four tuples, each representing a pair of coordinates `(x, y)`. The variable `i` has reached its final value of 3, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The other variables remain unchanged, with `n` still being an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 2, `res` remaining 0, `p1` and `p2` still representing the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first tuples and the fourth and third tuples, respectively, and `stdin` containing `t-9` testcases.
