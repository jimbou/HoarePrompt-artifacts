Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, stdin contains t-1 testcases. Each testcase consists of four lines, each line containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), which are the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area.
Code of the loop:
while n:
    coord = []
    res = 0
    for i in range(4):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        coord.append((x, y))
    coord = sorted(coord)
    p1 = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2
    p2 = (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2
    res = math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)
    print(round(res))
    n -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than -1 and equal to its original value minus 2, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, `res` is the square root of the product of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first tuples and the fourth and third tuples, `p1` is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first tuples, `p2` is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third tuples, `i` is equal to 4, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, stdin contains t-5 testcases, and the rounded value of `res` is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer greater than -1 and equal to its original value minus 3, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples (x, y), (x, y), (x, y), and (x, y), `res` is the square root of the product of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first tuples and the fourth and third tuples, `p1` is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first tuples, `p2` is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third tuples, `i` is 3, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, stdin contains t-10 testcases, range is at least 1, and the rounded value of `res` is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer greater than -1 and equal to its original value minus 4, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, `res` is the square root of the product of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first tuples and the squared differences between the coordinates of the fourth and third tuples, `p1` is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first tuples, `p2` is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third tuples, `i` is 3, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, stdin contains t-14 testcases, range is at least 1, and the rounded value of res is being printed, which is the rounded value of the square root of the product of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first tuples and the squared differences between the coordinates of the fourth and third tuples.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
