This function reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four lines of input, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of a square's corners. The function then calculates the area of the square by finding the difference between the coordinates of the second and first points, and the fourth and third points, taking the square root of the product of these differences, and rounding the result. The function prints the rounded area for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with the input buffer empty and the number of test cases set to 0.
