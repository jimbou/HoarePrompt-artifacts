Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 1, coord is a list containing a tuple of two integers, res is 0, stdin contains t-2 testcases, i is less than 4**

The code snippet reads a line from stdin, splits it into two integers x and y, and appends a tuple of these integers to the coord list. Since stdin initially contains t-1 testcases, after reading one line, it will contain t-2 testcases. The values of n, res, and i remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
