The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 4, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 1, coord is a list containing a tuple of two integers, res is 0, stdin contains t-2 testcases, i is less than 3**
