The code prints the rounded value of `res`, which is the square root of the product of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first tuples and the fourth and third tuples in the `coord` list.
Since the exact `coord` list is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the rounded value of the calculated `res`.
Output: **rounded value of the square root of the product of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first tuples and the fourth and third tuples in the coord list**
