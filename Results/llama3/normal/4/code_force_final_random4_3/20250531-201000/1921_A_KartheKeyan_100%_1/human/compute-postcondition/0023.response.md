Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 2, coord is a sorted list containing four tuples (x, y), (x, y), (x, y), and (x, y), res is the square root of the product of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first tuples and the fourth and third tuples, p1 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first tuples, p2 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third tuples, i is 3, x is an integer, y is an integer, stdin contains t-9 testcases, range is at least 1**

The code sorts the list of coordinates in ascending order, updates the values of p1 and p2 based on the new order, and calculates the value of res as the square root of the product of p1 and p2. The values of n, i, x, y, and the number of testcases in stdin remain unchanged.
