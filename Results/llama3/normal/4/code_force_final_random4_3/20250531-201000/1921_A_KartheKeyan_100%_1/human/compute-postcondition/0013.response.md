Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than -1 and equal to its original value minus 2, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, `res` is the square root of the product of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first tuples and the fourth and third tuples, `p1` is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first tuples, `p2` is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third tuples, `i` is equal to 4, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, stdin contains t-5 testcases, and the rounded value of `res` is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been decremented by 1, so it is now an integer greater than -1 and equal to its original value minus 2. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-5 testcases. The rounded value of `res` is still being printed.
