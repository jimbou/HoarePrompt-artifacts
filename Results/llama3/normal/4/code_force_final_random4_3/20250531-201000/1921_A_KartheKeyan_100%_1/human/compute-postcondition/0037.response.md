Based on the precondition, the value of `res` is the square root of the product of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first tuples and the squared differences between the coordinates of the fourth and third tuples in the `coord` list.

Since `res` is being rounded before printing, the output will be the rounded value of `res`.

Output: **the rounded value of the square root of the product of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first tuples and the squared differences between the coordinates of the fourth and third tuples in the coord list**
