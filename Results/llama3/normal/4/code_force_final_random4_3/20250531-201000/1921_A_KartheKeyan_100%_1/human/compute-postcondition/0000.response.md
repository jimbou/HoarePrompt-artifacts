Output State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, stdin contains t-1 testcases. Each testcase consists of four lines, each line containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), which are the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The while loop runs as long as `n` is not zero. Inside the loop, the first line assigns the integer value of the input to `l`. The second line initializes `s` to 0. The third line calculates the value of `s` as `(l//4)+(l-(4*(l//4)))//2` and assigns it to `s`. The fourth line prints the value of `s`. The fifth line decrements `n` by 1. 

Since the loop runs `n` times, `n` will be decremented by 1 each time, and the final value of `n` will be its original value minus 1. The stdin will contain `t-1` testcases, each consisting of four lines with two integers `x_i` and `y_i`.
