To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(4):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 4.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

The other variables in the loop head are not relevant to the loop condition, so we don't need to adjust their states.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 3, `coord` is a list containing one tuple of two integers, `res` is 0, `p1` is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first tuples, `p2` is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third tuples, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `stdin` contains t-11 testcases, `range` is at least 1, and the rounded value of `res` is being printed**
