Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 3, coord is a list containing two tuples of two integers, res is 0, p1 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first tuples, p2 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third tuples, i is 1, x is an integer, y is an integer, stdin contains t-12 testcases, range is at least 1, and the rounded value of res is being printed**

The code snippet reads two integers from the input, assigns them to `x` and `y`, and appends a tuple of these values to the `coord` list. The `n` variable remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The `res` variable also remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The `p1` and `p2` variables are not affected by the code, as they are not used or modified. The `i` variable remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The `range` variable is not affected by the code, as it is not used or modified. The `stdin` contains t-12 testcases, as one testcase has been consumed by the input operation. The rounded value of `res` is still being printed, as the code does not modify this behavior.
