Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 2, coord is a list containing one tuple (x, y), res is 0, p1 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first tuples, p2 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third tuples, i is 0, x is an integer, y is an integer, stdin contains t-6 testcases, range is at least 1**

The code executes two lines. The first line reads two integers from stdin, assigns them to x and y, and then appends a tuple (x, y) to the coord list. The second line does not affect any variables. After the code executes, the value of n remains unchanged, coord now contains one tuple (x, y), res remains 0, p1 and p2 remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code, i remains 0, x and y are now integers with specific values, and stdin contains t-6 testcases.
