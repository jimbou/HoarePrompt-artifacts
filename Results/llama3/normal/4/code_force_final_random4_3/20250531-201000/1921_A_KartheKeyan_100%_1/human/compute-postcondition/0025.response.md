The code prints the rounded value of `res`, which is the square root of the product of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first tuples and the fourth and third tuples in the `coord` list.

Output: **n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 2, coord is a sorted list containing four tuples (x, y), (x, y), (x, y), and (x, y), res is the square root of the product of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first tuples and the fourth and third tuples, p1 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first tuples, p2 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third tuples, i is 3, x is an integer, y is an integer, stdin contains t-9 testcases, range is at least 1, and the rounded value of res is being printed**
