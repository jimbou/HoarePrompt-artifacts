The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 4, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 1, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, and `stdin` contains `t-1` testcases do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `i` is less than 4.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 1, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` testcases, `i` is less than 4**
