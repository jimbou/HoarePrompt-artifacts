The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer greater than -1 and equal to its original value minus 3, So for the loop to be executed one more time n needed to have been at least 4 and n currently must be greater than 0.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 3, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples (x, y), (x, y), (x, y), and (x, y), `res` is the square root of the product of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first tuples and the fourth and third tuples, `p1` is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first tuples, `p2` is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third tuples, `i` is 3, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, stdin contains t-10 testcases, range is at least 1, and the rounded value of `res` is being printed.**
