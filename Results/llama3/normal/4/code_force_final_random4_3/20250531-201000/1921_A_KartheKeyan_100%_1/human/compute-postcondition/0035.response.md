Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 3, coord is a list containing four tuples of two integers, res is 0, p1 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first tuples, p2 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third tuples, i is 3, x is an integer, y is an integer, stdin contains t-14 testcases, range is at least 1, and the rounded value of res is being printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the list 'coord' containing four tuples of two integers, which are the coordinates input by the user. The variable 'i' will be 3, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The other variables remain unchanged, with 'n' still being an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 3, 'res' being 0, 'p1' and 'p2' being the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first tuples and the fourth and third tuples respectively, 'x' and 'y' being integers, 'stdin' containing t-14 testcases, and the range being at least 1. The rounded value of 'res' is still being printed.
