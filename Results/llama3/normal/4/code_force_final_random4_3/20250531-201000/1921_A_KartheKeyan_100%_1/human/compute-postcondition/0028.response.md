Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 3, coord is an empty list, res is 0, p1 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first tuples, p2 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third tuples, i is 3, x is an integer, y is an integer, stdin contains t-10 testcases, range is at least 1, and the rounded value of res is being printed.**

In this output state, the initial values of `n`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `x`, `y`, and stdin remain unchanged because they are not modified by the code. The value of `coord` is reset to an empty list, and the value of `res` is set to 0. The range and the rounded value of `res` being printed also remain unchanged.
