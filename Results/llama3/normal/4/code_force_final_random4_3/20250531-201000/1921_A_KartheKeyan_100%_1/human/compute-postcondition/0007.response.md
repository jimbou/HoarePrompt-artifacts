The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 4, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 1, `coord` is a list containing a tuple of two integers and the newly added tuple (x, y), `res` is 0, `stdin` contains t-3 testcases, `i` is less than 4, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer**
