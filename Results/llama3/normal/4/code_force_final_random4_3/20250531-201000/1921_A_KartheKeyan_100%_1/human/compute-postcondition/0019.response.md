Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 2, coord is a list containing two tuples (x, y) and (x, y), res is 0, p1 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first tuples, p2 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third tuples, i is 1, x is an integer, y is an integer, stdin contains t-7 testcases, range is at least 1**

The code snippet reads two integers from the input, assigns them to the variables x and y, and appends a tuple (x, y) to the list coord. The values of n, res, p1, p2, i, and range remain unchanged. The list coord now contains two tuples, and the number of test cases in stdin has decreased by one.
