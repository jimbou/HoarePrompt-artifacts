Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 3, coord is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, res is the square root of the product of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first tuples and the squared differences between the coordinates of the fourth and third tuples, p1 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first tuples, p2 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third tuples, i is 3, x is an integer, y is an integer, stdin contains t-14 testcases, range is at least 1, and the rounded value of res is being printed.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, and `range` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The value of `coord` is updated to be a sorted list of tuples, and the values of `p1` and `p2` are updated to be the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first tuples and the squared differences between the coordinates of the fourth and third tuples, respectively. The value of `res` is updated to be the square root of the product of `p1` and `p2`. The value of `stdin` is not affected, as the code does not read from or write to `stdin`. The rounded value of `res` is still being printed.
