Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 2, coord is an empty list, res is 0, p1 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first tuples, p2 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third tuples, i is equal to 4, x is an integer, y is an integer, stdin contains t-5 testcases.**

The code resets the value of `coord` to an empty list and sets `res` to 0. The values of `n`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, containing t-5 testcases.
