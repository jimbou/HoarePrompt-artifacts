Output State: **n is an integer equal to 0, coord is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, res is the square root of the product of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first tuples and the fourth and third tuples, p1 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first tuples, p2 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third tuples, i is equal to 3, x is an integer, y is an integer, stdin contains 0 testcases, and the rounded value of res is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop counter `n` has reached 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The `coord` list contains the sorted coordinates of the last square processed, `res` holds the area of the last square, `p1` and `p2` hold the squared differences between the coordinates of the last square, `i` is at its final value of 3, `x` and `y` are the last coordinates read from stdin, and there are no more testcases left in stdin. The rounded area of the last square is being printed.
