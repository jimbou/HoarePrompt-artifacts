The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 4, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2.
State: **n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 3, coord is a list containing two tuples of two integers, res is 0, p1 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first tuples, p2 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third tuples, i is 2, x is an integer, y is an integer, stdin contains t-12 testcases, range is at least 1, and the rounded value of res is being printed**
