Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus the inputs read by the code. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is less than or equal to `k` for all `i` in the range `[0, n - 1)`, then `k` is updated to its original value minus the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for all `i` in the range `[0, n - 1)`, `r` is set to the largest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `ii` is 0. Otherwise, `k` is set to 0, `r` is set to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` for some `i` in the range `[0, n - 1)`, `rem` is `k` modulo `i + 1`, and `y` is `n - 1 - i`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The loop has iterated `n - 1` times, and `i` has reached its final value of `n - 1`.
* The list `a` remains a sorted list of integers.
* The input from `stdin` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the loop.
* If the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is less than or equal to `k` for all iterations, then `k` is updated to its original value minus the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, multiplied by their respective indices plus one. In this case, `r` is set to the largest integer in `a`, and `rem`, `y`, and `ii` are set to 0.
* If the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k` for some iteration, then `k` is set to 0, `r` is set to the value of `a[i]` plus `k` divided by `i + 1` for that iteration, `rem` is set to `k` modulo `i + 1`, and `y` is set to `n - 1 - i`.
