Postcondition: ***n is at least 2, i is 1, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains at least one test case minus the inputs read by the code. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) is larger than k, then k is 0, r is a[i] + k // (i + 1), rem is k % (i + 1), y is n - 1 - i, and ii is 0. Otherwise, k is decreased by 2 times the difference between the second smallest and smallest integers in a, r is the second smallest integer in a, rem is 0, y is 0, and ii is 0.***
