Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer equal to its original value minus (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]), i is 1, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin is empty, ii is 1, r is the second smallest integer in a, rem is 0, y is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated by subtracting the product of `(i + 1)` and the difference between the second and first elements of list `a`. The value of `r` has been updated to be the second smallest integer in list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
