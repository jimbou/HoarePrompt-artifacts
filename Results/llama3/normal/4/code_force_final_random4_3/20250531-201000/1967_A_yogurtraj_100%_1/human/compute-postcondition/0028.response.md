Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `i` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs read by the code. The current value of `i` is 0 and the current value of `k` is less than the product of `i+1` and the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a`***
