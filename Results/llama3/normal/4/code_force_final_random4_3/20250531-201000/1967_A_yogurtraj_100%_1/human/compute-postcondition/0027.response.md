The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, i is n - 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 and i is now 0. 
State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `i` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs read by the code**
