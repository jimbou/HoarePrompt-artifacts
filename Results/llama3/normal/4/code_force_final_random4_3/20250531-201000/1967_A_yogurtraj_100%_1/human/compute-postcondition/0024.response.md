Postcondition: ***n is at least 1, i is n - 1, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains at least one test case minus the inputs read by the code. If k is not equal to 0, r is a[n - 1] + k // n and the value of (a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1 + k % n is being printed. If k is 0, the value of the expression (r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y is being printed.***
