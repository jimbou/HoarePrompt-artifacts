To determine the output of the print statement, we need to understand the values of the variables involved: `r`, `n`, `rem`, and `y`.

1. **`n`**: Given that `n` is at least 1, we know `n` is a positive integer.

2. **`i`**: Since `i` is `n - 1`, `i` will be a non-negative integer because `n` is at least 1.

3. **`a`**: `a` is a sorted list of integers. The exact values in `a` are not specified, but we know it's sorted.

4. **`stdin`**: The state of `stdin` (standard input) is mentioned but not directly relevant to the calculation of the print statement. It indicates that there are remaining inputs to be read, but we don't need this information to calculate the output of the given print statement.

5. **`k`**: `k` is 0. This variable is not directly used in the print statement, so its value does not affect the output.

6. **`r`**, **`rem`**, and **`y`**: The values of `r`, `rem`, and `y` are not explicitly defined in the initial state. Without knowing how these variables are calculated or assigned values within the code snippet, we cannot determine their exact values or how they relate to the other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, `k`).

Given the information provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the formula provided, without being able to substitute specific values for `r`, `rem`, and `y`.

Output: **(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y (where r, rem, and y are values determined by the code not specified in the initial state, and n is at least 1)**
