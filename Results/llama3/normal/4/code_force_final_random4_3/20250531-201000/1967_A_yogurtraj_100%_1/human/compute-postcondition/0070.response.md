Output: **`n` is an integer, `k` is not equal to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ii` is 1, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, `rem` is an integer, and `y` is an integer, stdin is empty, and this is printed: the value of the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n` which is equal to `(a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`**
