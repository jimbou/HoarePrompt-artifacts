Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is not equal to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs read by the code.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to be the sum of the last element of list `a` and the integer division of `k` by `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least one test case minus two inputs read by the code.
