Output State: **n is at least 3 and is reduced by (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]), i is 2, a is a sorted list of integers, r is a[i + 1], stdin contains at least one test case minus the inputs read by the code.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is reduced by the product of `(i + 1)` and the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. The list `a` remains a sorted list of integers. The variable `r` is assigned the value of `a[i + 1]`, which is the element at index `i + 1` in the sorted list `a`. The state of `stdin` is updated to reflect that at least one test case has been processed, minus the inputs read by the code.
