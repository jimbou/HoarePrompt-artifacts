Postcondition: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is 0, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus the inputs read by the code. The current value of `i` is such that the product of `i + 1` and the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]` is greater than `k`.**
