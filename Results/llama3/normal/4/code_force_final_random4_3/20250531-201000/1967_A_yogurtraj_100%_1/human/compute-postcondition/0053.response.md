Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `i` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` is empty, `ii` is 1, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0. The current value of `i` is 0 and the current value of `a[i + 1] - a[i]` is greater than `k` divided by `i + 1`***
