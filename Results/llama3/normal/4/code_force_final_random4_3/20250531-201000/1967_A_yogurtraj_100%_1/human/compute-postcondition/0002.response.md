According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is 0, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus the inputs read by the code**
