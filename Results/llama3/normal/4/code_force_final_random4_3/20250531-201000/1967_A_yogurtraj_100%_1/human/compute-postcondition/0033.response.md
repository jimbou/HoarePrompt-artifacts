The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs read by the code. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then k is 0, r is the first element of a plus k divided by 1, rem is k modulo 1, and y is n - 1. Otherwise, k is its original value minus (i + 1) times the difference between the elements at indices i + 1 and i in list a, r is the integer at index i + 1 in list a, rem is 0, and y is 0.**
