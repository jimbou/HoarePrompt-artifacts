State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs read by the code. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is the first element of `a` plus `k` divided by 1, `rem` is `k` modulo 1, and `y` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `k` is its original value minus `(i + 1)` times the difference between the elements at indices `i + 1` and `i` in list `a`, `r` is the integer at index `i + 1` in list `a`, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 0.**
