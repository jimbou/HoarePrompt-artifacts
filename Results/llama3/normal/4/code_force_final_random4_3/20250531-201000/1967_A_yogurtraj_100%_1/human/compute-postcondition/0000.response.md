According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ii` and the `input()` function. The loop will execute as long as there is input to read. So for the loop to be executed, `ii` must be 0 and `input()` must have at least one test case.
State: **stdin contains at least one test case, `ii` is 0**
