Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, i is n - 1, a is a sorted list of integers, r is the smallest integer in a, rem is 0, y is 0, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs read by the code**

In this final state, the values of `n` and `k` are determined by the first line of the code, which reads two integers from stdin. The value of `i` remains `n - 1`, as it was in the initial state. The list `a` is sorted in ascending order, and its smallest element is assigned to `r`. The variables `rem` and `y` are initialized to 0. Stdin now contains at least one test case minus the two inputs read by the code.
