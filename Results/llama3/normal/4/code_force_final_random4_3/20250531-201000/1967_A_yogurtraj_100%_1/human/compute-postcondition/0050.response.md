The only variables in the loop head are variables  ii and input. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, input contains at least one test case minus two inputs read by the code. So for the loop to be executed one more time the input must contain at least one test case minus one input read by the code and ii is 1.
State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, i is n - 1, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains at least one test case minus one inputs read by the code, ii is 1**
