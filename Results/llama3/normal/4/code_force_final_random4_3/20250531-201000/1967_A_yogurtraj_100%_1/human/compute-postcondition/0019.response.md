Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `r` is calculated as `a[n - 1] + k // n`, where `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the sorted list `a`, `k` is a non-zero integer, and `n` is at least 1.
* `k % n` is the remainder of `k` divided by `n`.
* The expression `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n` can be broken down as follows:
	+ `(r - 1) * n` is the product of `r - 1` and `n`, where `r - 1` is the value of `r` minus 1.
	+ `+ 1` adds 1 to the result of the previous product.
	+ `+ k % n` adds the remainder of `k` divided by `n` to the result.

Since `n` is at least 1, `i` is `n - 1`, and `a` is a sorted list of integers, we can conclude that:

* `a[n - 1]` is the largest element in the list `a`.
* `k // n` is the integer division of `k` by `n`, which means it is the quotient of `k` divided by `n`.
* `r` is the sum of the largest element in `a` and the quotient of `k` divided by `n`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the result of the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`, which can be described as:

Output: **(the largest element in the list a plus the quotient of k divided by n minus 1) times n plus 1 plus the remainder of k divided by n**
