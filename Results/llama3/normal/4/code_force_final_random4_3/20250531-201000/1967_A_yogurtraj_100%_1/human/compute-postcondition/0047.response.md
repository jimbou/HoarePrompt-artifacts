Based on the initial state, let's break down the variables and their values:

* `n` is an integer (its exact value is not specified)
* `k` is 0
* `i` is `n - 1`
* `a` is a sorted list of integers (its exact elements are not specified)
* `r` is the last element of `a` (since `a` is sorted, `r` is the maximum element in the list)
* `rem` is 0
* `y` is 0
* `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs read by the code (this information is not directly relevant to the print statement)

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)`

We can substitute the values of the variables:

* `r` is the last element of `a`, which is the maximum element in the sorted list
* `n` is an integer (its exact value is not specified)
* `rem` is 0
* `y` is 0

So, the expression becomes:

`print((max(a) - 1) * n + 1 + 0 + 0)`

Simplifying the expression:

`print((max(a) - 1) * n + 1)`

Since `max(a)` is the maximum element in the sorted list `a`, and `n` is an integer, the expression `(max(a) - 1) * n + 1` will evaluate to an integer value.

Output: **(max(a) - 1) * n + 1 (where max(a) is the maximum element in the sorted list a and n is an integer)**
