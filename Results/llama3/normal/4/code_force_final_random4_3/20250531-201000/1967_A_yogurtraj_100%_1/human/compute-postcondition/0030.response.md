Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `i` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs read by the code, and the product of (i + 1) and the difference between the elements at indices i + 1 and i in list a is less than or equal to k***
