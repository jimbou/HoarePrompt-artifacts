Postcondition: ***n is an integer, k is an integer, i is n - 1, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin is empty, ii is 1, r is an integer, rem is an integer, and y is an integer. If k is not equal to 0, the value of the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n` which is equal to `(a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1 + k % n` is printed. If k is 0, the value of the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y` is printed.***
