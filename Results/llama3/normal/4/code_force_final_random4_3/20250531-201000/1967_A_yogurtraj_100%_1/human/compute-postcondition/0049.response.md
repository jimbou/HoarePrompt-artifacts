Postcondition: ***n is an integer, k is an integer, i is n - 1, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs read by the code. If k is not equal to 0, then the value of the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n` is printed, where r is `a[n - 1] + k // n`. If k is 0, then the value of the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y` is printed, where r is the last element of the sorted list a.***
