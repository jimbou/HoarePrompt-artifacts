Output: **`n` is an integer, `k` is not equal to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs read by the code, and this is printed: the value of the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n` which is equal to `(a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`**
