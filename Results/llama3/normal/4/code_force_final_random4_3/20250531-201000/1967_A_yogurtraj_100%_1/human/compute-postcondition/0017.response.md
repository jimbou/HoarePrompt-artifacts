Postcondition: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus the inputs read by the code. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is less than or equal to `k` for all `i` in the range `[0, n - 1)`, then `k` is updated to its original value minus the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for all `i` in the range `[0, n - 1)`, `r` is set to the largest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `ii` is 0. Otherwise, `k` is set to 0, `r` is set to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` for some `i` in the range `[0, n - 1)`, `rem` is `k` modulo `i + 1`, and `y` is `n - 1 - i`. The current value of `k` is not equal to 0.**
