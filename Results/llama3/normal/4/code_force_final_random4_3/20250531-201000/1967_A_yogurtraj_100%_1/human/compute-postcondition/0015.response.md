Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains at least one test case minus the inputs read by the code. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is less than or equal to `k`, then `n` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `r` is set to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is set to `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is set to `n - 1 - i`, and `k` is set to 0.***
