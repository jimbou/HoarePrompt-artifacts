Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is 0, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus the inputs read by the code. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is updated to its original value minus `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is set to the second smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `ii` is 0. Otherwise, `k` is set to 0, `r` is set to the smallest integer in `a` plus `k` divided by `i + 1`, `rem` is `k` modulo `i + 1`, and `y` is `n - 1 - i`.***
