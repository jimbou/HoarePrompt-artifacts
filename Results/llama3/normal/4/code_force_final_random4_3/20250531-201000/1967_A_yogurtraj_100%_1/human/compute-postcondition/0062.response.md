State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, i is 2, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin is empty, ii is 1. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then k is 0, r is a[i] + k // (i + 1), rem is k % (i + 1), and y is n - 1 - i. Otherwise, k is updated to its original value minus (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]), r is the second smallest integer in a, rem is 0, and y is 0.**
