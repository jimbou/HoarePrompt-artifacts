Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is the smallest integer in a, rem is 0, y is 0, ii is 0, stdin contains at least one test case minus the inputs read by the code
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n - 1):
    if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
        r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
        rem = k % (i + 1)
        y = n - 1 - i
        k = 0
        break
    else:
        k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
        r = a[i + 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is 0, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus the inputs read by the code. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is updated to its original value minus `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is set to the second smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `ii` is 0. Otherwise, `k` is set to 0, `r` is set to the smallest integer in `a` plus `k` divided by `i + 1`, `rem` is `k` modulo `i + 1`, and `y` is `n - 1 - i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is at least 2, i is 1, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains at least one test case minus the inputs read by the code. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) is larger than k, then k is 0, r is a[i] + k // (i + 1), rem is k % (i + 1), y is n - 1 - i, and ii is 0. Otherwise, k is decreased by 2 times the difference between the second smallest and smallest integers in a, r is the second smallest integer in a, rem is 0, y is 0, and ii is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains at least one test case minus the inputs read by the code. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is less than or equal to `k`, then `n` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `r` is set to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is set to `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is set to `n - 1 - i`, and `k` is set to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
