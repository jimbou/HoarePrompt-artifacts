Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, a is a sorted list of integers, k is its original value minus (i + 1) times the difference between the elements at indices i + 1 and i in list a, r is the integer at index i + 1 in list a, rem is 0, y is 0, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs read by the code.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated by subtracting `(i + 1)` times the difference between the elements at indices `i + 1` and `i` in list `a`. The value of `r` has been updated to be the integer at index `i + 1` in list `a`. The value of `rem` has been set to 0, and the value of `y` has been set to 0. The values of `n`, `i`, and `a` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` also remains unchanged, as the code does not read any input from `stdin`.
