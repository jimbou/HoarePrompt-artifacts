Output State: **times is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), check is 2147483647, stdin contains t-1 inputs: each input is an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j < 2^31)**

The code reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to the variable "times". This integer represents the number of test cases. The value of "times" is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), as specified in the initial state.

The second line of the code assigns the value of 2^31 - 1 to the variable "check". This value is a constant and does not depend on any other variables or inputs.

After executing the code, the value of "times" is set to the integer read from stdin, and the value of "check" is set to 2147483647 (which is 2^31 - 1). The remaining inputs in stdin are not affected by the code and still contain t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by n integers a_1, ..., a_n.
