Output State: **`times` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `check` is 2^31 - 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `data` is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `stdin` contains t-2 inputs: each input is an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j < 2^31), `i` is the first integer in the list data, `s` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `i` and `check`.**

In this output state, the value of `s` is calculated by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the first integer `i` in the list `data` and the value of `check`, which is 2^31 - 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
