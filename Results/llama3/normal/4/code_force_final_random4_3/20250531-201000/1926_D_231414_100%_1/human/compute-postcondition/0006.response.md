Output State: **`times` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `check` is 2^31 - 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `data` is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, `dic` is a dictionary that contains the first integer `i` from the list `data` and its value is decreased by 1, `ans` is 0, `stdin` contains t-2 inputs: each input is an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j < 2^31), the current value of `i` is the first integer in the list `data` and is also a key in the dictionary `dic`, and `s` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `i` and `check`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `dic[i]` has been decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
