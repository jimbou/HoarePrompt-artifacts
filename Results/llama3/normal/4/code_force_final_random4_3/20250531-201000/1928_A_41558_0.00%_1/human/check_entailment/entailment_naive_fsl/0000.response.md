Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly handles all possible cases. 

1. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to form another rectangle by cutting the original rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides.

2. If `a` is equal to `2*b` or `b` is equal to `2*a`, it prints 'NO' because the only possible cut is to divide the rectangle into two equal rectangles, which is not considered a different rectangle.

3. In all other cases, it prints 'YES' because it's always possible to cut the rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides and then form another rectangle by combining these two rectangles.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.
