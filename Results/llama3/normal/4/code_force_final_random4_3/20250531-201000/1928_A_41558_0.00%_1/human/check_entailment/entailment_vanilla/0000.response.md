Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two rectangles with integer sides and then rotating and moving these two rectangles.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `n` and then iterating over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the size of the rectangle.

3. The program then checks if both `a` and `b` are odd numbers. If they are, it prints 'NO' because it's not possible to cut the rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides.

4. If `a` and `b` are not both odd, the program checks if `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO' because the resulting rectangles would be the same.

5. If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints 'YES' because it's possible to cut the rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides and then rotate and move these two rectangles to form another rectangle.

The program's logic is correct and it covers all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
