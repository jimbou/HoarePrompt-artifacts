Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and are the values of the second line of input, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If both `a` and `b` are odd, then 'NO' is printed. If `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` have been updated to the values of the second line of input, and the stdin now contains t-3 lines of input. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The conditions for printing 'NO' or 'YES' are still dependent on the values of `a` and `b`.
