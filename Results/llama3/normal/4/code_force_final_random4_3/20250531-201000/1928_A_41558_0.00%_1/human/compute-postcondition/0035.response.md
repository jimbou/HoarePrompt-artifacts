Output State: **`n` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is `n`, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and are the values of the last line of input, stdin is empty. If both `a` and `b` are odd, then 'NO' is printed. If `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop has finished executing and the variables `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` have reached their final values. The value of `n` is still between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), but it is now equal to the number of iterations that the loop executed. The value of `i` is equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `a` and `b` are the values of the last line of input, and the stdin is empty because all the input lines have been processed. The output of the loop is still determined by the conditions in the loop body, printing 'NO' if both `a` and `b` are odd or if one is twice the other, and 'YES' otherwise.
