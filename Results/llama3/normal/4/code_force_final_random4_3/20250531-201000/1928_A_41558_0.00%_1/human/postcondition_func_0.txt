This function reads a series of input lines from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t representing the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains two integers a and b. It then checks each pair of integers and prints 'YES' if the pair meets certain conditions (i.e., not both odd, and not one being twice the other), and 'NO' otherwise. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results, leaving stdin empty after execution.
