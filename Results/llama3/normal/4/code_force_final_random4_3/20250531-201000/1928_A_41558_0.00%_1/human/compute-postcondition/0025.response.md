The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and are the values of the second line of input, stdin contains t-2 lines of input, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If both `a` and `b` are odd, then 'NO' is printed. If `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**
