Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. The conditions checked in the program are:

1. If both `a` and `b` are odd, then it's not possible to obtain another rectangle, so it prints 'NO'.
2. If `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`, then it's also not possible to obtain another rectangle, so it prints 'NO'.
3. In all other cases, it's possible to obtain another rectangle, so it prints 'YES'.

This logic is consistent with the problem description and the examples provided. The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
