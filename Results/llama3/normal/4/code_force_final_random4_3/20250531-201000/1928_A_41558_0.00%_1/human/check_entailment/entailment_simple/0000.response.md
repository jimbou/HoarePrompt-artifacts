Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle.

Here's why:

1. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it means that the rectangle cannot be cut into two rectangles with integer sides. In this case, the program correctly prints 'NO'.

2. If `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`, it means that the rectangle can only be cut into two rectangles of the same size, which are considered the same. In this case, the program correctly prints 'NO'.

3. In all other cases, the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides, and these two rectangles can be used to form another rectangle that is different from the original one. In this case, the program correctly prints 'YES'.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the expected output for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **True**
