Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If both `a` and `b` are odd numbers, 'NO' is printed. If either `a` is even or `b` is even (or both are even), 'NO' is printed if either `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**
