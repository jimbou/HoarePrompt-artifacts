Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. 

The program first checks if both a and b are odd. If they are, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to form another rectangle in this case. 

Then, it checks if one of the dimensions is twice the other. If this is the case, it prints 'NO' because the only possible rectangles that can be formed are the original one and the one with the dimensions swapped, which are considered the same. 

In all other cases, it prints 'YES' because it's possible to form another rectangle by cutting the original one into two rectangles and then combining them in a different way. 

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing all test cases and printing the correct results. 

Correctness: **True**
