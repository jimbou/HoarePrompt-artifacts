Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and are the values of the first line of input, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9)**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the integers read from the first line of input, which are between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The stdin now contains t-3 lines of input, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), since one line has been consumed by the input operation.
