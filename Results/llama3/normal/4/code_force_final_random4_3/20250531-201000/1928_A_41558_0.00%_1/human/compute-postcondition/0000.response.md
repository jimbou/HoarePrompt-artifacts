The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `n`. In the initial state, the standard input contains multiple lines of input, with the first line containing a single integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4).

After executing the code, the value of `n` is set to the integer `t` read from the standard input. The remaining lines of input in the standard input are still present, but the first line has been consumed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines of input, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).**
