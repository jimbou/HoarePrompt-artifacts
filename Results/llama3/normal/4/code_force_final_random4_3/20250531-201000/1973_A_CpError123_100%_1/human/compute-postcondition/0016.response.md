Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers from the input, `x` is the integer part of the average of `a`, `b`, and `c`, `y` is the sum of `a` and `b`. If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, we skip to the next iteration of the loop and -1 is being printed. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statements.***
