The code accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing three integers. After accepting the first integer, the stdin still contains multiple test cases, each containing three integers. The value of `t` is equal to the first integer from the input.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing three integers.**
