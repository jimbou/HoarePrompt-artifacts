Output: **t is at least 1, a, b, and c are new integers from the input, x is the integer part of the average of new a, new b, and new c, y is the sum of new a and new b, stdin contains no input. If the sum of a, b, and c is odd, -1 is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken. and the minimum of the integer part of the average of new a, new b, and new c and the sum of new a and new b is printed**
