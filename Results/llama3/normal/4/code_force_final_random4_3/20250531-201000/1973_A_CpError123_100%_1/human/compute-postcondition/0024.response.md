Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are new integers from the input, `x` is the integer part of the average of new `a`, new `b`, and new `c`, `y` is the sum of new `a` and new `b`, stdin contains no input, -1 is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains no input. The only change is that we move on to the next iteration of the loop, and -1 is still being printed.
