Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, stdin contains one input: a space-separated list of integers. If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is an odd number, -1 has been printed and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop or if statement and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, the code continues to execute without printing -1.***
