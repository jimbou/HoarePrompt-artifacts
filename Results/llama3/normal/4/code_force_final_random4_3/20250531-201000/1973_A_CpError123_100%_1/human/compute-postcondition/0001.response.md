According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, which ensures that the loop will execute. So, the state of `t` needs to be adjusted to be at least 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the execution of the loop.


State: **`t` is at least 1**
