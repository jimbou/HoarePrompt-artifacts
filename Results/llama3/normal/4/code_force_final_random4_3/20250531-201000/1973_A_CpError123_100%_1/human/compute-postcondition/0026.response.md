Output State: **t is at least 1, a, b, and c are new integers from the input, x is the integer part of the average of new a, new b, and new c, y is the sum of new a and new b, stdin contains no input. If the sum of a, b, and c is odd, -1 is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to new integers from the input. The value of `x` is updated to the integer part of the average of the new `a`, `b`, and `c`. The value of `y` is updated to the sum of the new `a` and `b`. The value of `t` remains at least 1. Stdin contains no input. If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, -1 is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.
