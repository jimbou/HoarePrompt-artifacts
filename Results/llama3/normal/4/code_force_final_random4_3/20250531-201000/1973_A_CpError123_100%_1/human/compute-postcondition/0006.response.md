Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, stdin contains one input: a space-separated list of integers. The current value of the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is an odd number, -1 has been printed and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop or if statement and move to the next iteration.**

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code in the current loop or if statement and moves to the next iteration. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected, and the stdin still contains a space-separated list of integers. The sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` remains an odd number, and -1 has been printed.
