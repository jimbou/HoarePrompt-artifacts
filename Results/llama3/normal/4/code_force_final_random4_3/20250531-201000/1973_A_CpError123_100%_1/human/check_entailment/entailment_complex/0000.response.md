Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the scores of the three players `a`, `b`, and `c` and checks if their sum is odd. If it is, the program prints -1, which is correct because the sum of the scores must be even (each game contributes 2 points to the total sum).
3.  If the sum of the scores is even, the program calculates the maximum possible number of draws `x` by dividing the sum of the scores by 2 (since each draw contributes 1 point to the total sum).
4.  The program then calculates the sum of the scores of the first two players `y` (`a + b`).
5.  Finally, the program prints the minimum value between `x` and `y`, which represents the maximum possible number of draws that could have occurred.

The reasoning behind printing the minimum value between `x` and `y` is as follows:

*   If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, it means that the maximum possible number of draws is limited by the total sum of the scores. In this case, the minimum value between `x` and `y` is `x`, which is the correct answer.
*   If `x` is greater than `y`, it means that the maximum possible number of draws is limited by the sum of the scores of the first two players. In this case, the minimum value between `x` and `y` is `y`, which is the correct answer.

Overall, the program correctly calculates the maximum possible number of draws that could have occurred in each test case and prints the correct answer.

Correctness: **True**
