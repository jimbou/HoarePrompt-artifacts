Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all possible cases. For example, when the input is 1 1 10, the program outputs 2, but the correct output should be -1. This is because it is not possible to achieve the scores 1, 1, and 10 with any combination of games and results.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the total sum of scores is even and if the sum of the first two scores is less than or equal to the total sum of scores divided by 2. However, it does not consider the case where the third score is much larger than the first two scores, which can lead to an incorrect result.

To fix this issue, the program should also check if the third score is achievable with the remaining points after considering the first two scores. If not, it should output -1.
