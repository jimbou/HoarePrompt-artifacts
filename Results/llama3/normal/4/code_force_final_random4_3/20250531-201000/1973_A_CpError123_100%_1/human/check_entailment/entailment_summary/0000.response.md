Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly handles the case where the sum of the scores is odd. In this case, it prints -1, which is correct because the sum of the scores must be even (each game contributes 2 points to the total sum).

2.  The program calculates the minimum value between the integer part of the average of the three scores (`x`) and the sum of the first two scores (`y`). This is correct because the maximum number of draws is limited by the total number of points (`x`) and the number of points that can be distributed among the first two players (`y`).

3.  The program correctly handles the case where the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games and results. In this case, it prints -1.

4.  The program correctly handles the case where no games were played at all. In this case, it prints 0, which is correct because no draws can occur if no games are played.

5.  The program correctly handles the case where exactly one game occurred between the second and the third player and it ended in a draw. In this case, it prints 1, which is correct.

6.  The program correctly handles the case where there's no set of games achieving the scores. In this case, it prints -1, which is correct.

7.  The program correctly handles the case where the maximum possible number of draws is 2. In this case, it prints 2, which is correct.

8.  The program correctly handles the case where the maximum possible number of draws is 6. In this case, it prints 6, which is correct.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
