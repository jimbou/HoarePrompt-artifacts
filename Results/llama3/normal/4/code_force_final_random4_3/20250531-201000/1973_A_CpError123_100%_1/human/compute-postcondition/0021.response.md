Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are new integers from the input, `x` is the integer part of the average of new `a`, new `b`, and new `c`, `y` is the sum of new `a` and new `b`, stdin contains no input**.

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` have been updated to new integers from the input. The value of `x` is still the integer part of the average of `a`, `b`, and `c`, but now it is calculated using the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. Similarly, the value of `y` is still the sum of `a` and `b`, but now it is calculated using the new values of `a` and `b`. The value of `t` remains at least 1, and the stdin is now empty since it has been used to read the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
