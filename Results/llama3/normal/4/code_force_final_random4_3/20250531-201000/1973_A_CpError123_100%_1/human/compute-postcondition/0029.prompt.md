Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing three integers.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
        print(-1)
        continue
    x = (a + b + c) // 2
    y = a + b
    print(min(x, y))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, a, b, and c are integers, x is the integer part of the average of a, b, and c, y is the sum of a and b, stdin contains one input: a space-separated list of integers, and the minimum value between the integer part of the average of a, b, and c and the sum of a and b is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is at least 2, a, b, and c are integers from the input, x is the integer part of the average of a, b, and c, y is the sum of a and b, and the minimum value between the integer part of the average of a, b, and c (x) and the sum of a and b (y) is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is at least 1, a, b, and c are new integers from the input, x is the integer part of the average of new a, new b, and new c, y is the sum of new a and new b, stdin contains no input. If the sum of a, b, and c is odd, -1 is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken. and the minimum of the integer part of the average of new a, new b, and new c and the sum of new a and new b is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
