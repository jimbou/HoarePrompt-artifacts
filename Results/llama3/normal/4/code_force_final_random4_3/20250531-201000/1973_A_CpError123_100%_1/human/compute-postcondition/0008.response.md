Output State: **t is at least 1, a, b, and c are integers, x is the integer part of the average of a, b, and c, y is the sum of a and b, stdin contains one input: a space-separated list of integers.**

The code first calculates the integer part of the average of `a`, `b`, and `c` and assigns it to `x`. This means `x` will be the integer part of `(a + b + c) / 2`. Then, it calculates the sum of `a` and `b` and assigns it to `y`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The state of `stdin` also remains the same as no input operation is performed. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are also unchanged as they are only used in calculations but not modified.
