Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers from the input, `x` is the integer part of the average of `a`, `b`, and `c`, `y` is the sum of `a` and `b`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop and -1 is being printed**

The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The only effect of the code is to skip to the next iteration of the loop. Also, -1 is being printed.
