Output State: **t is 0, a, b, and c are the last integers from the input, x is the integer part of the average of the last a, b, and c, y is the sum of the last a and b, stdin contains no input, and the minimum value between the integer part of the average of the last a, b, and c and the sum of the last a and b is printed for each test case.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable t will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variables a, b, and c will hold the values of the last test case. The variable x will be the integer part of the average of the last a, b, and c, and y will be the sum of the last a and b. The standard input (stdin) will be empty, as all test cases have been read. Finally, the minimum value between the integer part of the average of the last a, b, and c and the sum of the last a and b will be printed for each test case.
