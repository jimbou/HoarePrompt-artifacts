Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the scores of the three players `a`, `b`, and `c` and checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the program prints -1 and continues to the next test case. This is correct because the sum of the scores must be even, as each game can result in either a win (2 points) or a draw (1 point each).
3. If the sum of the scores is even, the program calculates the total number of points `x` by dividing the sum of the scores by 2. This is correct because each game contributes 2 points to the total score.
4. The program then calculates the sum of the scores of the first two players `y` by adding `a` and `b`. This is correct because the first two players can play against each other, and the sum of their scores represents the maximum number of points they can have.
5. Finally, the program prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. This is correct because the maximum number of draws that can occur is limited by the total number of points `x` and the sum of the scores of the first two players `y`. The minimum of these two values represents the maximum number of draws that can occur.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where the sum of the scores is odd, and prints the correct result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
