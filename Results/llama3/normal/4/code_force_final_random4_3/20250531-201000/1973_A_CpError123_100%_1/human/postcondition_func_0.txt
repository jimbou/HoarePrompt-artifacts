This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers representing the scores of three players. It calculates the minimum value between the integer part of the average of the three scores and the sum of the first two scores for each test case, and prints this value. If the sum of the three scores is odd, it prints -1 for that test case. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input stream empty.
