Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers from the input, `x` is the integer part of the average of `a`, `b`, and `c`, `y` is the sum of `a` and `b`, and stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the integers from the input, and the values of `x` and `y` are updated based on the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and stdin is empty since the input has been consumed.
