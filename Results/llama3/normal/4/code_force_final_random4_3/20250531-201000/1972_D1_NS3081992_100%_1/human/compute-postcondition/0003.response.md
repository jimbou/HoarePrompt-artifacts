Output State: **`func_10()` returns a value greater than 1, `_` is 1, `func_15()` returns a value that can be converted to a string, the standard output contains the string representation of the value returned by `func_15()` twice, each followed by a newline character.**

In this output state, the values of `func_10()` and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `func_15()` is still a value that can be converted to a string. The standard output now contains the string representation of the value returned by `func_15()` twice, each followed by a newline character, because the code writes the string representation of the value returned by `func_15()` to the standard output, and the initial state already had the string representation of the value returned by `func_15()` followed by a newline character in the standard output.
