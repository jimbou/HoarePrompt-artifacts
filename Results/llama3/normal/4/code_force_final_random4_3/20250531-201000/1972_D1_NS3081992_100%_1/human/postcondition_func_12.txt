This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers a and b, and returns the GCD along with the coefficients x and y such that ax + by = GCD(a, b). If b is 0, the function returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively calls another function func_13 with swapped and reduced arguments, and returns the calculated coefficients and GCD.
