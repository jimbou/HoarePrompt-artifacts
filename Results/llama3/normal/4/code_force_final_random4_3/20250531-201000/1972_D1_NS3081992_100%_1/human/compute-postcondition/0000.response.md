The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and the function `func_10()`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the return value of `func_10()`. If `func_10()` returns at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the return value of `func_10()` is a non-negative integer, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **`func_10()` returns a value greater than 0, `_` is 0, `func_15()` returns a value that can be converted to a string**
