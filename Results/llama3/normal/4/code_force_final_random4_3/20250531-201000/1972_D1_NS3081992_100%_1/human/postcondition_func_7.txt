The function generates a list of 'rows' number of elements, where each element is the return value of the function 'func_7()'. The function takes one parameter, 'rows', which is a positive integer, and returns a list of that length, with each element being the result of calling 'func_7()'. The function does not modify the input parameter 'rows' or any external state, and its sole purpose is to create and return this list of elements.
