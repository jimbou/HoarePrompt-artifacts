You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a list of lists of integers, processing is a list of integers, da is a positive integer such that 1 <= da <= len(d), and rank is a list of integers.
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if (len(d[da]) == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1.
    #State: *`d` is a list of lists of integers, `processing` is a list of integers, `da` is a positive integer such that 1 <= da <= len(d), `rank` is a list of integers, `tmp` is 1000000000, and the length of the sublist `d[da]` is more than 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
        
    #State: d is a list of lists of integers, processing is a list of integers, da is a positive integer such that 1 <= da <= len(d), rank is a list of integers, tmp is an integer less than or equal to 1000000000, the length of the sublist d[da] is more than 1, d[da] must have at least as many integers as the number of iterations of the loop, di is the last integer in the list d[da]. If the di-1th element of processing is 0, then tmp is an integer less than or equal to the minimum of its original value and the result of func_12(d, processing, di, rank).
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns an integer that is one more than tmp, where tmp is an integer less than or equal to 1000000000 and is also less than or equal to the minimum of its original value and the result of func_12(d, processing, di, rank), if the (di-1)th element of processing is 0.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the integer 1.

Case_2: The program returns an integer that is one more than tmp, where tmp is an integer less than or equal to 1000000000 and is also less than or equal to the minimum of its original value and the result of func_12(d, processing, di, rank), if the (di-1)th element of processing is 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
