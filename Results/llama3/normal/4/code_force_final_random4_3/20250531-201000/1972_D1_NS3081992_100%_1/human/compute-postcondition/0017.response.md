Functionality: **This function calculates and returns a rank value based on the input parameters `d`, `processing`, `da`, and `rank`. It takes a list of lists of integers `d`, a list of integers `processing`, a positive integer `da` within the bounds of `d`, and a list of integers `rank`. The function iterates through the sublist `d[da]`, updating the `processing` list and calculating a temporary value `tmp` based on the results of a recursive call to `func_12`. If the length of the sublist `d[da]` is 1, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it updates the `rank` list with the calculated `tmp` value plus 1 and returns this value. The function effectively assigns a rank to the sublist `d[da]` based on the processing results and recursive calculations.**
