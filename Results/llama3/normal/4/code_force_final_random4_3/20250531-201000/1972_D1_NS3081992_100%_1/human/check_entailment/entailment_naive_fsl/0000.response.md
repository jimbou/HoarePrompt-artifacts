Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct because it accurately implements the mathematical formula for calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The formula is based on the concept of greatest common divisor (GCD) and the properties of multiples.

The program uses a while loop to iterate over all possible values of i, which represents the GCD of a and b. For each value of i, it calculates the number of pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions using the formula (n + i) // (i * i). The result is accumulated in the variable ans.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when n or m is 1, and it also handles the case when i * i exceeds n + i.

The program's logic is sound, and it accurately implements the mathematical formula for calculating the number of ordered pairs. Therefore, it is correct for all potential cases.

Note: The program's correctness can be further verified by testing it with a large number of test cases, including edge cases and random inputs. However, based on the provided code and the problem description, it appears that the program is correct.
