Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
2. a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

The provided program uses a simple and efficient approach to solve this problem. It iterates over all possible values of i from 1 to m, and for each i, it calculates the number of valid pairs (a, b) where a + b is a multiple of i * i.

The key insight here is that if a + b is a multiple of i * i, then a must be a multiple of i, and b must be a multiple of i * i. Therefore, the number of valid pairs for a given i is equal to the number of multiples of i in the range [1, n] divided by i, plus the number of multiples of i * i in the range [1, m] divided by i * i.

The program correctly calculates this value for each i and sums them up to get the total number of valid pairs.

However, there is a small mistake in the program. The function func_15() returns ans - 1, which is incorrect. The correct return value should be ans.

Correctness: **False**
