Output State: **`func_10()` returns a value greater than 2, `_` is 2, `func_15()` returns a value that can be converted to a string, the standard output contains the string representation of the value returned by `func_15()` four times, each followed by a newline character.**

The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` writes the string representation of the value returned by `func_15()` to the standard output, followed by a newline character. Since the standard output already contains the string representation of the value returned by `func_15()` three times, each followed by a newline character, the total number of times the string representation of the value returned by `func_15()` is written to the standard output is now four. The values of `func_10()` and `_` are not affected by the code.
