    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
    #The program returns a list containing the result of function func_3() repeated rows_number times, where rows_number is a positive integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a list by repeating the result of function func_3() a specified number of times, as determined by the input parameter rows_number, and returns this list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a byte string representing a line from standard input, excluding the newline character at the end.
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
    #The program returns a byte string representing a line from standard input, excluding the newline character at the end.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a line from standard input and returns it as a byte string, excluding the newline character at the end.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a string representing a line from standard input, which is expected to be read and decoded.
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
    #The program returns a string representing a line from standard input, which has been read, decoded, and stripped of any trailing characters.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a line from standard input, decodes it, removes any trailing characters, and returns the resulting string.

    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of two integers that were space-separated in the input string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: rows is a positive integer
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
    #The program returns a list of 'rows' number of elements, where each element is the return value of the function 'func_7()'

#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates a list of 'rows' number of elements, where each element is the return value of the function 'func_7()'. The function takes one parameter, 'rows', which is a positive integer, and returns a list of that length, with each element being the result of calling 'func_7()'. The function does not modify the input parameter 'rows' or any external state, and its sole purpose is to create and return this list of elements.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: a string
    return input()
    #The program returns the string that was provided as input from stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a string from standard input and returns it unchanged, effectively echoing the input string.

    if (len(d[da]) == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1.
    #State: *`d` is a list of lists of integers, `processing` is a list of integers, `da` is a positive integer such that 1 <= da <= len(d), `rank` is a list of integers, `tmp` is 1000000000, and the length of the sublist `d[da]` is more than 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
        
    #State: d is a list of lists of integers, processing is a list of integers, da is a positive integer such that 1 <= da <= len(d), rank is a list of integers, tmp is an integer less than or equal to 1000000000, the length of the sublist d[da] is more than 1, d[da] must have at least as many integers as the number of iterations of the loop, di is the last integer in the list d[da]. If the di-1th element of processing is 0, then tmp is an integer less than or equal to the minimum of its original value and the result of func_12(d, processing, di, rank).
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns an integer that is one more than tmp, where tmp is an integer less than or equal to 1000000000 and is also less than or equal to the minimum of its original value and the result of func_12(d, processing, di, rank), if the (di-1)th element of processing is 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns a rank value based on the input parameters `d`, `processing`, `da`, and `rank`. It takes a list of lists of integers `d`, a list of integers `processing`, a positive integer `da` within the bounds of `d`, and a list of integers `rank`. The function iterates through the sublist `d[da]`, updating the `processing` list and calculating a temporary value `tmp` based on the results of a recursive call to `func_12`. If the length of the sublist `d[da]` is 1, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it updates the `rank` list with the calculated `tmp` value plus 1 and returns this value. The function effectively assigns a rank to the sublist `d[da]` based on the processing results and recursive calculations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.

        #The program returns a tuple containing the values of x, y, and a. x is 1, y is 0, and a is a positive integer.
    #State: *a and b are positive integers, and b is not equal to 0
    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns three values: y, x - a // b * y, and g. y is a return value of func_13(b, a % b), x is a return value of func_13(b, a % b), and g is a return value of func_13(b, a % b). The value of x - a // b * y is calculated by subtracting the product of a // b and y from x. The value of a // b is the integer division of a by b, which is the quotient of a divided by b. The value of a % b is the remainder of a divided by b.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers a and b, and returns the GCD along with the coefficients x and y such that ax + by = GCD(a, b). If b is 0, the function returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively calls another function func_13 with swapped and reduced arguments, and returns the calculated coefficients and GCD.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers of length n, n and m are positive integers, k is an integer.
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
        
    #State: `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, `n` and `m` are positive integers, `i` is `n-1`. If the current value of `a[i]` is less than `m`, then `k` is updated to `k - (m - a[n-1])`.

        return 1
        #The program returns integer 1
    #State: *`a` is a list of integers of length `n`, `n` and `m` are positive integers, `i` is `n-1`. `k` is less than 0
    return -1
    #The program returns -1

#Overall this is what the function does:This function evaluates a list of integers `a` of length `n` against a threshold value `m` and an initial value `k`. It iterates through the list, updating `k` by subtracting the difference between `m` and each element in `a` that is less than `m`. If `k` remains non-negative after this process, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function effectively assesses whether the cumulative adjustments to `k` based on the elements of `a` relative to `m` result in a non-negative or negative value.

    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)

    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the original value of ans plus the sum of (n + k) // (k * k) for all k from 1 to i - 1, minus 1, where n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6, i is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the square root of n + 1, and k ranges from 1 to i - 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates the sum of the floor division of (n + k) by (k * k) for all k from 1 to the smallest integer greater than or equal to the square root of n + 1, minus 1, where n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6.

    #State: The loop executes `func_10()` times, `_` is `func_10() - 1`, `func_15()` returns a value that can be converted to a string, the standard output contains the string representation of the value returned by `func_15()` `func_10()` times, each followed by a newline character.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function writes the string representation of the value returned by `func_15()` to the standard output a number of times equal to the non-negative integer returned by `func_10()`, with each output followed by a newline character.
