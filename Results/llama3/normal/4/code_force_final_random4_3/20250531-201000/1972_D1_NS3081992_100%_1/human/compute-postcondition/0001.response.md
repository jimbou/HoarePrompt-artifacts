Output State: **`func_10()` returns a value greater than 0, `_` is 0, `func_15()` returns a value that can be converted to a string, the standard output contains the string representation of the value returned by `func_15()` followed by a newline character.**

In this output state, the values of `func_10()` and `_` remain unchanged. The value returned by `func_15()` is converted to a string using the `str()` function and written to the standard output using `sys.stdout.write()`, followed by a newline character. The standard output now contains this string representation of the value returned by `func_15()`.
