The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and `func_10()`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value returned by `func_10()`. If the value returned by `func_10()` is greater than the current value of `_`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 and `func_10()` returns a value greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1 and `func_10()` must return a value greater than 2.
State: **`func_10()` returns a value greater than 2, `_` is 2, `func_15()` returns a value that can be converted to a string, the standard output contains the string representation of the value returned by `func_15()` three times, each followed by a newline character.**
