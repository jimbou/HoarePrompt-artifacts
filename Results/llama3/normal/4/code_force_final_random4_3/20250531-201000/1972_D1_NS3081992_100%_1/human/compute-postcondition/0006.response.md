Output State: **The loop executes `func_10()` times, `_` is `func_10() - 1`, `func_15()` returns a value that can be converted to a string, the standard output contains the string representation of the value returned by `func_15()` `func_10()` times, each followed by a newline character.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop will execute as many times as the value returned by `func_10()`. In each iteration, the variable `_` will take on the value of the current iteration number, starting from 0 and ending at `func_10() - 1`. The function `func_15()` will be called in each iteration, and its return value will be converted to a string and written to the standard output, followed by a newline character. This process will repeat `func_10()` times, resulting in the standard output containing the string representation of the value returned by `func_15()` `func_10()` times, each followed by a newline character.
