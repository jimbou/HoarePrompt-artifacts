Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 0, `b` is greater than 1, `c` is an integer, `d` is a string, `e` is a string, `j` is 1, `k` is equal to `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to be equal to the index of `d[j]` in the substring `e[k:]` plus 1 plus the original value of `k`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases.
