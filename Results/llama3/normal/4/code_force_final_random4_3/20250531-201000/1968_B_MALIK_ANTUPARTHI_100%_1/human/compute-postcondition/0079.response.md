Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is equal to `a`, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `d` is a string, `e` is a string, `j` is equal to `b`, and `k` is equal to `b`, and the value of `k` which is equal to `b` is being printed, stdin contains 0 test cases.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the loop counter `i` will be equal to the initial value of `a`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4. The variables `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` will retain their last values from the last iteration of the loop. The variable `j` will be equal to `b`, and `k` will be equal to `b`. The value of `k` (which is equal to `b`) will be printed. Additionally, since all test cases have been processed, there will be 0 test cases left in the standard input (stdin).
