Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 2, `b` is greater than 3, `c` is an integer, `d` is a string, `e` is a string. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, `k` is equal to `j + 1`. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then no changes are made to `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, `d`, or `e`.***
