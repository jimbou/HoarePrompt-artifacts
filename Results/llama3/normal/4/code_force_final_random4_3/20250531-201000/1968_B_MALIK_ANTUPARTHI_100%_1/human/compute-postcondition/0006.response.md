Postcondition: **`a` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 0, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` is a string, `e` is a string, `j` is 0, `k` is the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` plus 1 plus the previous value of `k`, stdin contains t-2 test cases. The current value of `k` is equal to `c` or the current value of `j` is equal to `b - 1`.**
