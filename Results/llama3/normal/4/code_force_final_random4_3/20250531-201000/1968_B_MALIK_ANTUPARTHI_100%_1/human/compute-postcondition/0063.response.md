Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 2, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` is a string, `e` is a string. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b` minus 1, `j` is 0 and `k` is `j` plus 1. Otherwise, the values of `j` and `k` are unchanged. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `j` is 0 and `k` is 0.***
