Postcondition: **`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 1, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` is a string, `e` is a string, `j` is 0, and `k` is the index of the character at index `j` in string `d` in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` plus 1 plus `k`. The current value of `k` is either equal to `c` or the current value of `j` is equal to `b` minus 1.**
