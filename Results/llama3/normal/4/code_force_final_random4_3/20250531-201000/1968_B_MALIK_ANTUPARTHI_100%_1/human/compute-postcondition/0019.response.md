Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 0, `b` is greater than 2, `c` is an integer, `d` is a string, `e` is a string, `j` is 2, `k` is `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `i`, and `j` remains the same as in the initial state. The value of `k` is updated to be the index of the substring `d[j]` in the string `e` starting from the `k`-th character, plus 1, plus the original value of `k`. The number of test cases in the standard input remains the same, which is t-2.
