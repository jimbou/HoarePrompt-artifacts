To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `b`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `b`. If `b` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 1, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` is a string, `e` is a string, `j` is 0, `k` is 0**
