The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 and stdin contains t-1 test cases, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `a` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`a` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**
