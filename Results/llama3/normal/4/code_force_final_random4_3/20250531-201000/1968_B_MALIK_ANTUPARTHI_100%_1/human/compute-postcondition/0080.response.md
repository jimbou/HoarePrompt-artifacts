Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers and two binary strings. It then iterates through the first binary string, checking for the presence of each character in the second binary string. If a character is found, it updates a counter to the index of the found character in the second string plus one. If a character is not found or the end of the first string is reached, it prints the current counter value and moves on to the next test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, leaving the input stream empty.**
