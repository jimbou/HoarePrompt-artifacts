Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 1, `b` is greater than 1, `c` is an integer, `d` is a string, `e` is a string, `k` is the index of the character at index `j` in string `d` in the substring of `e` starting from index `j` plus 1 plus `j` if `d[j]` is in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`, otherwise `k` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `k` is updated based on the condition that if the character at index `j` in string `d` is found in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`, then `k` is set to the index of that character in the substring of `e` starting from index `j` plus 1 plus `j`. If the character is not found, `k` is set to 0. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
