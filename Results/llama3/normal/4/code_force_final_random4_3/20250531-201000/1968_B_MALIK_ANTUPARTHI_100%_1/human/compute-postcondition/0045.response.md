Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 1, `b` is greater than 2, `c` is an integer, `d` is a string, `e` is a string, `k` is the index of the character at index `j` in string `d` in the substring of `e` starting from index `j` plus 1 plus `j`, plus 1 plus `k`.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to be the index of the character at index `j` in string `d` in the substring of `e` starting from index `j` plus 1 plus `j`, plus 1 plus `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
