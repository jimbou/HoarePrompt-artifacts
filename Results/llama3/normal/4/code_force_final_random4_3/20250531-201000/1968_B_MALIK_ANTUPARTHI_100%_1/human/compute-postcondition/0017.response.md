Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 0, `b` is greater than 1, `c` is an integer, `d` is a string, `e` is a string. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, `j` is 1 and `k` is 2. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `a` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 0, `b` is greater than 1, `c` is an integer, `d` is a string, `e` is a string, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases.***
