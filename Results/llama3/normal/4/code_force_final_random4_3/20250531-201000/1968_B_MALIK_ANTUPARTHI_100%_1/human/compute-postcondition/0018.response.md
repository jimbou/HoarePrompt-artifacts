The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `b`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `b`. If `j` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `b` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `b` must be greater than 2.
State: **`a` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 0, `b` is greater than 2, `c` is an integer, `d` is a string, `e` is a string, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**
