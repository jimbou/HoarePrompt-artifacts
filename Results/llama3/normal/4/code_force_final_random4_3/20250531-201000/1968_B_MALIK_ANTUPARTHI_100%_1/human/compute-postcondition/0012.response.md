The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `b`. If `j` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `b` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `b` must be greater than 1.
State: **`a` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 0, `b` is greater than 1, `c` is an integer, `d` is a string, `e` is a string, `j` is 1, if `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, `k` is set to `j + 1`, otherwise, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made. stdin contains t-2 test cases.**
