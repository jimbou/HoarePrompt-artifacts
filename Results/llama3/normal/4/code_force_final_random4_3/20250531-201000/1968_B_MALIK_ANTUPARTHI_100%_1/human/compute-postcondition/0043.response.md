Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 1, `b` is greater than 1, `c` is an integer, `d` is a string, `e` is a string. If `d[j]` is in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`, then if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b` minus 1, `j` is updated to `j` plus 1. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `d[j]` is not in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`, then `j` is 0 and `k` is the index of the character at index `j` in string `d` in the substring of `e` starting from index `j` plus 1 plus `j`.***
