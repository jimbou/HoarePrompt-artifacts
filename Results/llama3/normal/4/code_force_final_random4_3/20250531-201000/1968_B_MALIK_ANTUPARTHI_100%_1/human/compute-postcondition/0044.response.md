The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `b`. If `j` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `b` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `b` must be greater than 2.
State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 1, `b` is greater than 2, `c` is an integer, `d` is a string, `e` is a string. If `d[j]` is in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`, then if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b` minus 1, `j` is updated to `j` plus 1. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `d[j]` is not in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`, then `j` is 0 and `k` is the index of the character at index `j` in string `d` in the substring of `e` starting from index `j` plus 1 plus `j`.**
