Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 0, `b` is greater than or equal to 0, `c` is an integer, `d` is a string, `e` is a string, `j` is equal to `b`, `k` is either `b` or `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the loop counter `j` is equal to the number of iterations `b`. The value of `k` depends on whether `d[j]` is in `e[k:]` or not. If it is, then `k` is either equal to `b` or it is the index of `d[j]` in `e[k:]` plus 1 plus its previous value. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is equal to `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
