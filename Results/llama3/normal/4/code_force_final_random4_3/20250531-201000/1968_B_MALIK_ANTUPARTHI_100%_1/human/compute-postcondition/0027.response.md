The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than 1.
State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 1, `b` is greater than or equal to 0, `c` is an integer, `d` is a string, `e` is a string, `j` is equal to `b`, and `k` is either `b` or `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k**, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and the value of `k` is being printed
