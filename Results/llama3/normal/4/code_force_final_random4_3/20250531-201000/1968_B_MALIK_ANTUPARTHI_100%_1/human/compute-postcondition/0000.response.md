Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings a and b of lengths n and m, respectively.**

In this output state, the variable `a` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4. The stdin now contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of two integers n and m, and two binary strings a and b of lengths n and m, respectively.
