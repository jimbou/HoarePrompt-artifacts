To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for j in range(b):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `b`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2 and `b` is greater than 2. To execute the loop again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 3.

Since `b` is the only other variable in the loop head, we need to ensure that `b` is still greater than `j` (which is now 3) for the loop to execute again. Therefore, `b` must be greater than 3.

The other variables `a`, `c`, `d`, and `e` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 2, `b` is greater than 3, `c` is an integer, `d` is a string, `e` is a string**
