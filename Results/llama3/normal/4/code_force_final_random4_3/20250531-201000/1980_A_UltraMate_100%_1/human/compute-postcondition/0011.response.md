Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `i` is the third character in the string `p`, `ans` is increased by `m`**

The code increments the value of `ans` by `m`, which is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The output state still includes all the initial conditions, with the addition of the updated value of `ans`.
