Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that is not empty and has at least 2 keys, `i` is 'A', `ans` is `m`, `_` is 2, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, and the current value of `i` is not a key in the dictionary `hmp`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to `m`, which is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive. All other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-3` test cases. The current value of `i` is still 'A' and is not a key in the dictionary `hmp`.
