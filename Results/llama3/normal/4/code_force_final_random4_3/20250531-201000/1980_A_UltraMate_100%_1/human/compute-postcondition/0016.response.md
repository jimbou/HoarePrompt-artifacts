Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that is not empty, `i` is one of the keys in `hmp`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`, and the current value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is increased by the difference between `m` and the frequency of character `i` in string `s`. All other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still between 1 and 1000, `n` between 1 and 50, `m` between 1 and 5, `s` a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` still 'ABCDEFG', and `hmp` still a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s`. The value of `hmp[i]` is still less than `m`, and `i` is still one of the keys in `hmp`.
