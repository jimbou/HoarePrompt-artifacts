Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) followed by a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    ans = 0
    p = 'ABCDEFG'
    hmp = Counter(s)
    for i in p:
        if i not in hmp:
            ans += m
    for i in hmp:
        if hmp[i] < m:
            ans += m - hmp[i]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that is not empty and has at least 2 keys, `i` is one of the keys in `hmp`, and the value of `ans` which is an integer that has been updated based on the frequency of characters in the string `s` and the value of `m` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, s is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', p is 'ABCDEFG', hmp is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in s that is not empty and has at least 2 keys, i is the last key in hmp, ans is the sum of m for each character in p that is not in hmp plus m minus the frequency of the character i in hmp if the frequency of the character i in hmp is less than m. Otherwise, ans is the sum of m for each character in p that is not in hmp plus m minus the frequency of the character i in hmp plus m minus the frequency of the character i in hmp, _ is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and ans is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that is not empty and has at least 2 keys, `i` is the last key in `hmp`, `ans` is either `m`, `m+m`, `m+m+m`, `m+m+m+m`, `m+m+m+m+m`, `m+m+m+m+m+m`, or `m+m+m+m+m+m+m` increased by `m - hmp[i]` for each key `i` in `hmp` where the frequency of character `i` in `s` is less than `m`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 2, and the value of `ans` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
