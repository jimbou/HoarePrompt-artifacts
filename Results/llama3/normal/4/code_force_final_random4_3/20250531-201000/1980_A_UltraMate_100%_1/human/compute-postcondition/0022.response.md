Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that is not empty and has at least 2 keys, `i` is another key in `hmp`, `ans` is increased by an integer between -4 and 4 inclusive.**

The value of `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`, where `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, and `hmp[i]` is the frequency of character `i` in string `s`, which is less than `m`. Therefore, the value of `ans` is increased by an integer between -4 and 4 inclusive. The values of the other variables are not affected.
