The value of `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`. The value of `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, and the value of `hmp[i]` is the frequency of character `i` in string `s`. Since `i` is one of the keys in `hmp`, `hmp[i]` is a positive integer. Therefore, the value of `m - hmp[i]` is an integer between -4 and 4 inclusive. The value of `ans` is increased by this amount.

The values of the other variables are not affected. The value of `t` is still an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `stdin` still contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is still an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is still an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is still a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is still 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is still a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that is not empty and has at least 2 keys, and `i` is still one of the keys in `hmp`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that is not empty and has at least 2 keys, `i` is one of the keys in `hmp`, and `ans` is increased by an integer between -4 and 4 inclusive.**
