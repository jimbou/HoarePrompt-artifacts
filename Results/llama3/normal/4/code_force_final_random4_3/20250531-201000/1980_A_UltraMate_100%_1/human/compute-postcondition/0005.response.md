Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `ans` is `m`, `p` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s`, and the current value of `i` is 'A' which is not present in `hmp`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to `m`, which is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now equal to `m`, which means it has been incremented by the value of `m`. The rest of the variables maintain their initial values and properties.
