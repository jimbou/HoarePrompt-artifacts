Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that is not empty and has at least 2 keys, `i` is the second key in `hmp`, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in `p` that is not in `hmp` plus `m` minus the frequency of the character `i` in `hmp` if the frequency of the character `i` in `hmp` is less than `m`. Otherwise, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in `p` that is not in `hmp` plus `m` minus the frequency of the character `i` in `hmp`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `m` minus the frequency of the character `i` in `hmp`. This means that `ans` now includes the additional value of `m` minus the frequency of the character `i` in `hmp`, which is either less than `m` or equal to `m` depending on the frequency of the character `i` in `hmp`. All other variables remain unchanged.
