Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that is not empty and has at least 2 keys, `i` is 'C', `ans` is either `2*m` or `m+0+m`, `_` is 2, stdin contains `t-3` test cases. If the character 'B' is not a key in the dictionary `hmp`, then `ans` is set to `m+m`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is increased by `m`. If 'B' is not a key in the dictionary `hmp`, then `ans` becomes `m+m`, otherwise it becomes `2*m` or `m+0+m`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
