Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `i` is the second character in the string `p`, and `ans` is increased by `m`**

In natural language, the output state is that all the initial variables retain their values and properties, but the value of `ans` has been increased by the value of `m`, which is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive.
