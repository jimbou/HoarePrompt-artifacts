Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that is not empty and has at least 2 keys, `i` is another key in `hmp`, `ans` is either `m`, `m+m`, `m+m+m`, `m+m+m+m`, `m+m+m+m+m`, `m+m+m+m+m+m`, or `m+m+m+m+m+m+m` increased by `m - hmp[i]` if the frequency of character `i` in `s` is less than `m`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 2.***
