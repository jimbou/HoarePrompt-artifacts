Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that is not empty and has at least 2 keys, `i` is 'B', `ans` is either `m` or `m+0`, `_` is 2, stdin contains `t-3` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` is either `m` or `m+0` because the initial state specifies that if the character 'A' is not a key in the dictionary `hmp`, then `ans` is set to `m`. The code `ans += m` increments the value of `ans` by `m`. Since the initial value of `ans` is 0, the new value of `ans` is either `m` (if 'A' is not a key in `hmp`) or `m+0` (if 'A' is a key in `hmp`). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
