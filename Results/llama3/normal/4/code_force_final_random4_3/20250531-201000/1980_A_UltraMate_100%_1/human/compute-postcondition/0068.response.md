Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that is not empty and has at least 1 key, `i` is one of the keys in `hmp`, `ans` is either `m+m`, `m+m+m`, `m+m+m+m`, `m+m+m+m+m`, `m+m+m+m+m+m`, or `m+m+m+m+m+m+m`, `_` is 2, stdin contains `t-3` test cases. The current value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m` and `ans` has been increased by `m - hmp[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `m - hmp[i]` to its previous value. The value of `hmp[i]` is still less than `m`, but the exact value of `ans` is now one of the possible values listed, depending on the initial value of `ans` and the value of `m - hmp[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
