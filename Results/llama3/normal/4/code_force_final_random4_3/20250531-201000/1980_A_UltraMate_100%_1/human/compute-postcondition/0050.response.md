Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, s is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', p is 'ABCDEFG', hmp is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in s that is not empty and has at least 2 keys, i is the last key in hmp, ans is the sum of m for each character in p that is not in hmp plus m minus the frequency of the character i in hmp if the frequency of the character i in hmp is less than m. Otherwise, ans is the sum of m for each character in p that is not in hmp plus m minus the frequency of the character i in hmp plus m minus the frequency of the character i in hmp, _ is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations, and the variable `i` has taken on the value of the last key in the dictionary `hmp`. The variable `ans` has been updated to include the sum of `m` for each character in `p` that is not in `hmp`, plus the difference between `m` and the frequency of the character `i` in `hmp` if the frequency is less than `m`. If the frequency is not less than `m`, `ans` includes the sum of `m` for each character in `p` that is not in `hmp`, plus the difference between `m` and the frequency of the character `i` in `hmp` for each iteration of the loop. The other variables remain unchanged.
