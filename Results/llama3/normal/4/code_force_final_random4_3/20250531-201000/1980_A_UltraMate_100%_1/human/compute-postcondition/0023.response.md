Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that is not empty and has at least 2 keys, `i` is another key in `hmp`. If the frequency of `i` in `s` is less than `m`, `ans` is increased by an integer between -4 and 4 inclusive. Otherwise, no change is made to `ans`.***
