Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, s is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', p is 'ABCDEFG', hmp is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in s that is not empty and has at least 2 keys, i is 'G', ans is the sum of m for each character in p that is not in hmp, _ is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all characters in the string 'ABCDEFG'. The variable 'i' has taken on the value of each character in 'ABCDEFG' during each iteration. The variable 'ans' has been updated to include the sum of 'm' for each character in 'ABCDEFG' that is not present in the dictionary 'hmp'. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
