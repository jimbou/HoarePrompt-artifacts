Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that is not empty and has at least 2 keys, `i` is 'G', `ans` is either `m`, `m+m`, `m+m+m`, `m+m+m+m`, `m+m+m+m+m`, `m+m+m+m+m+m`, or `m+m+m+m+m+m+m`, `_` is 2, stdin contains `t-3` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `i` has moved to the last character 'G' in the string `p`, and the variable `ans` has been updated to be the sum of `m` for each character in `p` that is not a key in the dictionary `hmp`. The other variables remain unchanged.
