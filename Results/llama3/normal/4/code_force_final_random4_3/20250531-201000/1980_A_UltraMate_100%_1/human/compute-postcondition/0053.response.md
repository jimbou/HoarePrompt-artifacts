To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `_` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1 and `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that is not empty and has at least 2 keys, `i` is the last key in `hmp`, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in `p` that is not in `hmp` plus `m` minus the frequency of the character `i` in `hmp` if the frequency of the character `i` in `hmp` is less than `m`. Otherwise, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in `p` that is not in `hmp` plus `m` minus the frequency of the character `i` in `hmp` plus `m` minus the frequency of the character `i` in `hmp`, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, and `ans` is printed**
