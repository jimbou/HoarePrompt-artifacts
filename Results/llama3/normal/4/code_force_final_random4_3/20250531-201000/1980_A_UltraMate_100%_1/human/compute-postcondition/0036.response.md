The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `p`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `p`. If `i` is less than the length of `p`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 'B', `p` is 'ABCDEFG'. For the loop to execute again `i` must be 'C'.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that is not empty and has at least 2 keys, `i` is 'C', `ans` is either `m` if 'B' is not in `hmp` or remains unchanged if 'B' is in `hmp`, `_` is 1, stdin contains `t-2` test cases.**
