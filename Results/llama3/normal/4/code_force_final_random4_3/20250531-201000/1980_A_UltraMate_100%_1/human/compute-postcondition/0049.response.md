Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that is not empty and has at least 3 keys, `i` is the third key in `hmp`, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in `p` that is not in `hmp` plus `m` minus the frequency of the character `i` in `hmp` if the frequency of the character `i` in `hmp` is less than `m`. Otherwise, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in `p` that is not in `hmp` plus `m` minus the frequency of the character `i` in `hmp` plus `m` minus the frequency of the character `i` in `hmp`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases.***
