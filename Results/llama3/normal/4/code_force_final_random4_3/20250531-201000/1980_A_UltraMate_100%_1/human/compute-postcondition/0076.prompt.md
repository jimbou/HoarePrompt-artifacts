Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that is not empty and has at least 2 keys, `i` is 'G', `ans` is either `m`, `m+m`, `m+m+m`, `m+m+m+m`, `m+m+m+m+m`, `m+m+m+m+m+m`, or `m+m+m+m+m+m+m`, `_` is 2, stdin contains `t-3` test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in hmp:
    if hmp[i] < m:
        ans += m - hmp[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that is not empty and has at least 1 key, `i` is one of the keys in `hmp`, `ans` is either `m`, `m+m`, `m+m+m`, `m+m+m+m`, `m+m+m+m+m`, `m+m+m+m+m+m`, or `m+m+m+m+m+m+m`, `_` is 2, stdin contains `t-3` test cases. If the frequency of character `i` in `s` is less than `m`, then `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that is not empty and has at least 2 keys, `i` is another key in `hmp`, `ans` is either `m`, `m+m`, `m+m+m`, `m+m+m+m`, `m+m+m+m+m`, `m+m+m+m+m+m`, or `m+m+m+m+m+m+m` increased by `m - hmp[i]` if the frequency of character `i` in `s` is less than `m`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that is not empty and has at least 2 keys, `i` is another key in `hmp`, `ans` is either `m`, `m+m`, `m+m+m`, `m+m+m+m`, `m+m+m+m+m`, `m+m+m+m+m+m`, or `m+m+m+m+m+m+m` increased by `m - hmp[i]` if the frequency of character `i` in `s` is less than `m`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
