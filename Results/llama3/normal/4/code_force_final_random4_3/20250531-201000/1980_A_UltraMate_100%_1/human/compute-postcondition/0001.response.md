According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, which ensures that the loop will execute. So, the state of `t` does not need to be adjusted. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop execution.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) followed by a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G'.**
