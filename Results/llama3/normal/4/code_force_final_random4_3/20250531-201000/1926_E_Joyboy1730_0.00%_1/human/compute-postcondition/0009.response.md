Output State: **n is 0, m is an integer equal to the original value of n.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `n` becomes 0, and the variable `m` becomes equal to the original value of `n`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `k`, `_`, `stdin`, and `L`) remain unchanged.
