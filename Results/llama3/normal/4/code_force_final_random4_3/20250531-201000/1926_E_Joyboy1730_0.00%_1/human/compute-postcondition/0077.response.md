Postcondition: ***`n` is 0, `m` is 1, `k` is an integer, `L` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `pow` is 1, `tot` is 0, `a` is the first element in the list L, `_` is 2, `t` is greater than 2. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to the sum of `tot` and `a`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
