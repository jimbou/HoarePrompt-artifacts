Output State: **n is 0, m is 1, k is an integer, L is an empty list, pow is 2 to the power of the number of iterations, tot is the sum of all elements in L, a is undefined, _ is 2, t is greater than 2**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that n becomes 0, m becomes 1, and the other variables remain unchanged.
