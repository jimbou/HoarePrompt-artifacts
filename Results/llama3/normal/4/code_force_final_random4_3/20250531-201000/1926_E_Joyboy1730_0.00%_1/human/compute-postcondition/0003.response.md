To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition, which is `while n:`. This implies that the loop will execute as long as `n` is not zero.

Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 (inclusive)
- `n` and `k` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive)
- `_` is 0
- `stdin` contains `t - 1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)
- `L` is an empty list

The only variable in the loop head is `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must not be zero. Since `n` is already defined as an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), it inherently satisfies the condition for the loop to execute at least once because it cannot be zero.

Therefore, no adjustments to the state are necessary for the loop to execute the first time, as the condition for `n` already ensures it will not be zero.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 (inclusive), `n` and `k` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t - 1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), `L` is an empty list**
