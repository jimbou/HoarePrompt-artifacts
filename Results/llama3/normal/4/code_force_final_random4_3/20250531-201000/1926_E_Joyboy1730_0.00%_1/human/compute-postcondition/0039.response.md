Output State: **n is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus (n+1)//2 and n must be greater than 1, m is (n+1)//2, k is an integer, L is an empty list, pow is 2^len(L), tot is 0, a is undefined, _ is 1, t is greater than 1**

The first line assigns the value of `(n + 1) // 2` to `m`. Since `n` is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus `(n+1)//2` and `n` must be greater than 1, the value of `m` is equal to `(n+1)//2`. The second line subtracts the value of `m` from `n`, making `n` equal to its original value minus `(n+1)//2`. No other variables are affected.
