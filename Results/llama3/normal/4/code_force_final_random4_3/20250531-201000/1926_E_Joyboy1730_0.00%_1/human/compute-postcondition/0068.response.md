The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is a non-zero integer reduced by half and rounded down and n must be greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time n must be greater than 1.
State: **n is a non-zero integer reduced by half and rounded down and n must be greater than 1, m is n, k is an integer, L is an empty list, pow is 2 to the power of the number of iterations, tot is the sum of all elements in L, a is undefined, _ is 2, t is greater than 2**
