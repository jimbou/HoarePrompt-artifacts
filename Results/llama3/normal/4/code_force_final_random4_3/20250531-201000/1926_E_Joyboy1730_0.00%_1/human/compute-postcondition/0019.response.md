To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is 0.
   - `m` is 0.
   - `pow` is 2.
   - `tot` is equal to its original value plus `a`. Since `tot`'s original value isn't specified, we'll denote its original value as `tot_original`. Thus, `tot = tot_original + a`.
   - `k` is equal to its original value minus the new value of `tot`. If we denote `k`'s original value as `k_original`, then `k = k_original - (tot_original + a)`.
   - `L` is a list with at least 2 elements.
   - `a` is the second element in the list `L`.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The expression to be printed is `pow * (2 * k - 1)`.
   - Given `pow` is 2, the expression simplifies to `2 * (2 * k - 1)`.

3. **Substituting `k`**:
   - Since `k = k_original - (tot_original + a)`, substituting this into the expression gives us `2 * (2 * (k_original - (tot_original + a)) - 1)`.

4. **Simplifying**:
   - This simplifies further to `2 * (2 * k_original - 2 * tot_original - 2 * a - 1)`.

5. **Final Expression**:
   - Without explicit values for `k_original`, `tot_original`, and the elements of list `L` (specifically `a`), we cannot compute an exact numerical value. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

**Output**: **2 * (2 * k_original - 2 * tot_original - 2 * a - 1) (where k_original is the original value of k, tot_original is the original value of tot, and a is the second element of list L)**
