Output State: **`n` is 0, `m` is 0, `pow` is 1, `tot` is 0, `L` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list, the current value of `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to the sum of `tot` and `a`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `m`, `pow`, `tot`, `L`, and `a` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means that the execution of the program will continue from the next line of code outside the loop or if statement. The conditions that `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to the sum of `tot` and `a` are still valid.
