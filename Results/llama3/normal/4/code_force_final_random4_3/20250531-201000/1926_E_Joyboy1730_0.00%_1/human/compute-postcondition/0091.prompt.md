Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is 0, m is 1, k is an integer, L is an empty list, pow is 1, tot is 0, a is undefined, _ is 2, t is greater than 2
Code of the loop:
for a in L:
    if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
        print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
        break
    tot += a
    k -= tot
    pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is 0, m is 1, k is an integer, L is a list that must have at least 1 element, pow is 2, tot is a, a is the first element in the list L, _ is 2, t is greater than 2. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to the sum of tot and a, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is 0, m is 1, k is an integer equal to its original value minus tot minus a, L is a list that must have at least 2 elements, pow is 4, tot is a plus a, a is the second element in the list L, _ is 2, t is greater than 2

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is 0, m is 1, k is an integer equal to its original value minus tot minus a minus the third element in the list minus tot, L is a list that must have at least 3 elements, pow is 8, tot is a plus a plus the third element in the list plus a, a is the third element in the list, _ is 2, t is greater than 2. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot plus a, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
