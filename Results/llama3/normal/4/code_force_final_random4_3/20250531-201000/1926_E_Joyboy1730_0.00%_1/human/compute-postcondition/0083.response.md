Postcondition: **`n` is 0, `m` is 1, `k` is an integer, `L` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `pow` is 2, `tot` is a, `a` is the second element in the list `L`, `_` is 2, `t` is greater than 2. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot` plus `a`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
