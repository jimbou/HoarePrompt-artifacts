Output State: **`n` is 0, `m` is 0, `k` is an integer equal to its original value minus tot minus a, `L` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `pow` is 4, `tot` is a plus its original value, `a` is the third element in `L`, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables retain their original values since the break statement only exits the innermost loop or if statement without modifying any variables. The print statement before the break statement is not affected by the break statement and its output remains the same, which is pow * (2 * k - 1) where pow is 4 and k is an integer equal to its original value minus tot minus a.
