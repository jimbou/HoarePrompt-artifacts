According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list L. If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, n is 0, m is 0, tot is 0, pow is 1. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the variable a is the first element in the list.
State: **n is 0, m is 0, tot is 0, pow is 1, L is a list that must have at least 1 element, a is the first element in the list**
