Output State: **n is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus (n+1)//2, m is (n+1)//2, k is an integer, L is an empty list, pow is 2^len(L), tot is 0, a is undefined, _ is 1, t is greater than 1**

The code modifies the values of `n` and `m`. The first line assigns the value of `(n + 1) // 2` to `m`, which is the integer division of `n + 1` by 2. The second line subtracts the value of `m` from `n`, effectively reducing `n` by half (rounded down). The other variables remain unchanged.
