The first line assigns the integer values of the first line of input to `n` and `k`. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 (inclusive), and stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), `n` and `k` become integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The second line assigns an empty list to `L`. The third line does not affect any variables.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 (inclusive), n and k are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), L is an empty list**
