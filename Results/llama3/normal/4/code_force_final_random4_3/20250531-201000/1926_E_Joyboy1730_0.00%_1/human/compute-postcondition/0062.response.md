The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is 0, `m` is 0, `k` is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of all elements in L, `L` is a list that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `pow` is 2 to the power of the number of iterations, `tot` is the sum of all elements in L, `a` is the last element in L, `_` is 2, `t` is greater than 2**
