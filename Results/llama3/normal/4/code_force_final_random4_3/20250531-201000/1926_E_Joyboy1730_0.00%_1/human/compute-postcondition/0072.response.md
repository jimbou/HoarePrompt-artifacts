According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list L. If the list L has at least 1 element the loop executes. Before the loop starts, L is an empty list, so it needs to be adjusted to have at least 1 element. Also, a is undefined, so it needs to be adjusted to be the first element in the list L.


State: **`n` is 0, `m` is 1, `k` is an integer, `L` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `pow` is 1, `tot` is 0, `a` is the first element in the list L, `_` is 2, `t` is greater than 2**
