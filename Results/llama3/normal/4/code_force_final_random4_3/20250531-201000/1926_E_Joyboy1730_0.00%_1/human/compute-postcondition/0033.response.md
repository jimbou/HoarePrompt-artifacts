Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, L is an empty list, m is 0, pow is 2^len(L), tot is 0, a is undefined, _ is 1, t is greater than 1**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `n` and `k`, overwriting their initial values. The second line creates an empty list `L`, which has a length of 0. The third line does not affect any variables.

After the code executes, `n` and `k` are integers, but their exact values depend on the input. `L` is an empty list, so `pow` becomes 2^0, which is 1. Since `L` is empty, `tot` is 0. The value of `a` is no longer defined because it was previously the last element in the list `L`, but `L` is now empty. The values of `m`, `_`, and `t` remain unchanged.
