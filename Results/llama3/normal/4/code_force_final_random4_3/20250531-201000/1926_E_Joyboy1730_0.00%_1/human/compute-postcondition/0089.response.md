Postcondition: ***`n` is 0, `m` is 1, `k` is an integer equal to its original value minus tot minus a minus the third element in the list, `L` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `pow` is 4, `tot` is a plus a plus the third element in the list, `a` is the third element in the list, `_` is 2, `t` is greater than 2. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot` plus `a`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
