The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus (n+1)//2 and n must be greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the original value of n needed to have been greater than 1 and n currently must be greater than 0.
State: **n is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus (n+1)//2 and n must be greater than 1, m is 0, k is an integer, L is an empty list, pow is 2^len(L), tot is 0, a is undefined, _ is 1, t is greater than 1**
