To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `a` and `L`. The loop will execute if `L` has at least one element, and `a` will take the value of the first element in `L` at the start of the loop. 

State: **`n` is 0, `m` is 0, `k` is an integer, `L` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `pow` is 1, `tot` is 0, `a` is the first element in `L`, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1**
