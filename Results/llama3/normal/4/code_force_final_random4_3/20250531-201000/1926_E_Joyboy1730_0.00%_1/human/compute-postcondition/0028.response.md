Output State: **`n` is 0, `m` is 0, `pow` is 4, `L` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in the list, `tot` is equal to its original value plus the third element in the list, `k` is equal to its original value minus the new value of `tot`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `m`, `pow`, `L`, `a`, `tot`, and `k` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
