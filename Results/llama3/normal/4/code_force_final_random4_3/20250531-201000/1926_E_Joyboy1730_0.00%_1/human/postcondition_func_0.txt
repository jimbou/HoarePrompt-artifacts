The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k. It then performs a series of calculations involving these integers, including dividing n by 2 and updating k based on the results. The function prints the result of these calculations to standard output, specifically the value of 2^i * (2*k - 1), where i is the number of iterations and k is the updated value. The function repeats this process for each test case, reading input and printing output for each case.
