To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the given Python code snippet step by step.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `m` is 0.
   - `pow` is 4.
   - `L` is a list with at least 3 elements.
   - `a` is the third element in the list `L`.
   - `tot` is equal to its original value plus the third element in the list `L`. Since `tot`'s original value isn't specified, we'll consider it as `tot + a` where `tot` is its initial value.
   - `k` is equal to its original value minus the new value of `tot`. Since `k`'s original value isn't specified, we'll consider it as `k - (tot + a)`.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The expression to be printed is `pow * (2 * k - 1)`.
   - Given that `pow` is 4, the expression simplifies to `4 * (2 * k - 1)`.

3. **Determining the Value of `k`:**
   - Since `k` is equal to its original value minus the new value of `tot`, and `tot` is its original value plus `a`, we have `k = k - (tot + a)`.
   - However, without the original values of `k` and `tot`, we cannot simplify this further. Thus, `k` remains as `k - (tot + a)`.

4. **Substituting `k` into the Expression:**
   - Substituting `k - (tot + a)` for `k` in the expression `4 * (2 * k - 1)`, we get `4 * (2 * (k - (tot + a)) - 1)`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Without explicit values for `k`, `tot`, and `a`, we cannot compute a numerical value for the expression.
   - However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the expression `4 * (2 * (k - (tot + a)) - 1)`.

Output: **4 * (2 * (k - (tot + a)) - 1) (where k, tot, and a are as described in the initial state)**
