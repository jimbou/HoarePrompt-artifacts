Output State: **n is 0, m is 0, pow is 2, tot is equal to its original value plus a, k is equal to its original value minus the new value of tot, L is a list that must have at least 2 elements, a is the second element in the list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables n, m, pow, tot, k, L, and a do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The variable tot is still equal to its original value plus a, and k is still equal to its original value minus the new value of tot. The list L still has at least 2 elements, and a is still the second element in the list.
