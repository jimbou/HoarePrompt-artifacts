The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) minus half of its original value plus 1, So for the loop to be executed one more time the original value of n needed to have been greater than 1 and n currently must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) minus half of its original value plus 1 and n currently must be greater than 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), L is an empty list, m is an integer equal to half of the original value of n plus 1**
