Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) minus three quarters of its original value plus 1 and n currently must be greater than 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), L is an empty list, m is an integer equal to three quarters of the original value of n plus 1**

The code modifies the values of `m` and `n`. The first line assigns the value of `(n + 1) // 2` to `m`, which is equivalent to half of the original value of `n` plus 1, but since `n` has been reduced by half of its original value plus 1, `m` is now three quarters of the original value of `n` plus 1. The second line subtracts the value of `m` from `n`, effectively reducing `n` by three quarters of its original value plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
