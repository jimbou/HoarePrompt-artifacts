Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is 0, m is 0, tot is 0, pow is 1
Code of the loop:
for a in L:
    if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
        print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
        break
    tot += a
    k -= tot
    pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is 0, m is 0, pow is 2, tot is equal to its original value plus a, k is equal to its original value minus the new value of tot, L is a list that must have at least 1 element, a is the first element in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is 0, m is 0, pow is 4, L is a list that must have at least 2 elements, a is the second element in the list, tot is equal to its original value plus a, k is equal to its original value minus the new value of tot.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is 0, m is 0, pow is 8, L is a list that must have at least 3 elements, a is the third element in the list, tot is equal to its original value plus 2 times the third element in the list, k is equal to its original value minus 2 times the new value of tot. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot plus a, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
