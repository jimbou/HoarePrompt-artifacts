Postcondition: **n is 0, m is 0, pow is 2, L is a list that must have at least 2 elements, a is the second element in the list. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot plus a, then tot is equal to its original value plus a, k is equal to its original value minus the new value of tot, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
