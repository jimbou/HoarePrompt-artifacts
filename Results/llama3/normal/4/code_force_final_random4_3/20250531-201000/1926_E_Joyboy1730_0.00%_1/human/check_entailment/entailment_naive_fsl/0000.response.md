Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the number of cards that are twice an odd number, three times an odd number, and so on. The program uses a while loop to calculate the number of cards that are odd, but it does not correctly calculate the number of cards that are twice an odd number, three times an odd number, and so on.

For example, if the input is n = 10 and k = 5, the program will output 6, but the correct output should be 10. This is because the program does not correctly calculate the number of cards that are twice an odd number.

The correct approach would be to use a loop to calculate the number of cards that are odd, twice an odd number, three times an odd number, and so on, and then use this information to determine the k-th card.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        pow = 1
        while True:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            if k <= m:
                print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
                break
            k -= m
            n -= m
            pow *= 2
```
This program correctly calculates the k-th card by using a loop to calculate the number of cards that are odd, twice an odd number, three times an odd number, and so on, and then uses this information to determine the k-th card.
