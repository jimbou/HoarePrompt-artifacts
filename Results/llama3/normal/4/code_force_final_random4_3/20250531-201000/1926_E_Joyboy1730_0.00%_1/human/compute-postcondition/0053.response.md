Postcondition: ***n is 0, m is 0, k is an integer, L is a list that must have at least 2 elements, pow is 2, tot is a, a is the second element in L, _ is 1, t is greater than 1. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot plus a, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
