Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), L is an empty list, m is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 (inclusive)**

The code calculates the value of `m` as the integer division of `n + 1` by 2, which results in an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 (inclusive). Then, it subtracts `m` from `n`, which reduces the value of `n` by half, making it an integer between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive). The values of `t`, `k`, `_`, `stdin`, and `L` remain unchanged.
