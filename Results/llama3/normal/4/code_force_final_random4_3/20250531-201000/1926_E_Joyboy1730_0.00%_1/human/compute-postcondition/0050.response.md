The code prints the result of the expression `pow * (2 * k - 1)`. 

In this expression, `pow` is 2, and `k` is an integer. 

So, the expression can be simplified as `2 * (2 * k - 1)`. 

This expression can be further simplified as `4 * k - 2`.

Since `k` is an integer, the result of the expression `4 * k - 2` will also be an integer.

Output: **4 * k - 2 (where k is an integer)**
