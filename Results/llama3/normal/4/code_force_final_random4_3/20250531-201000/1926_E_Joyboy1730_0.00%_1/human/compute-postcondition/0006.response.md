Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) minus half of its original value plus 1, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), L is an empty list, m is an integer equal to half of the original value of n plus 1.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been reduced by half of its original value plus 1, and the value of `m` has been set to half of the original value of `n` plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
