Postcondition: ***`n` is 0, `m` is 0, `pow` is 4, `L` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in the list, `tot` is equal to its original value plus the third element in the list, `k` is equal to its original value minus the new value of `tot`. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot` plus `a`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
