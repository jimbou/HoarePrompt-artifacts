The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) followed by `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9). After accepting the integer `t`, the stdin now contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`. The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 (inclusive). The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9).**
