The code prints the result of the expression `pow * (2 * k - 1)`. 

The value of `pow` is given as 2. The value of `k` is an integer, but its exact value is not specified.

The expression `2 * k - 1` will be evaluated first. Since `k` is an integer, this expression will also be an integer.

Then, the result of `2 * k - 1` will be multiplied by `pow`, which is 2.

Output: **4 * k - 2 (where k is an integer)**
