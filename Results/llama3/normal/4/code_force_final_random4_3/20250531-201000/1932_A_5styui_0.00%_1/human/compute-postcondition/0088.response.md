Postcondition: ***t is at least 2, a is greater than 1, i is 2, d is an integer equal to the input value, b is a non-empty string, stdin contains t-5 test cases. If the first character of string b is '@', then s is 1 and j is 0. If the first character of string b is not '@', then s is 0 and j is 0. If the string b is not empty and the first character of string b is '*', or if the string b is empty and the character at index j+1 of string b is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
