Postcondition: ***t is at least 2, a is greater than 1, i is 2, d is an integer equal to the input value, b is a non-empty string, stdin contains t-5 test cases, j is 1. If the character at index j+1 in string b is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
