Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `j` is 1, `s` is 1 more than its previous value, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is at least 2, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, and `j` is 1 is still valid after the code has been executed. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases.
