Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a non-empty string, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The break statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to exit the innermost loop or if statement it is directly inside. The values of `t`, `a`, `i`, `d`, `b`, and `j` remain the same, and the stdin still contains `t-5` test cases.
