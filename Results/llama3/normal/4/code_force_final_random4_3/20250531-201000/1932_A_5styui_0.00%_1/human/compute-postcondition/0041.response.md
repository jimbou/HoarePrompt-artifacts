Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string equal to the input string that must have at least 1 character and the first character is '@', `j` is 0, `s` is 1, stdin contains `t-4` test cases.**

The value of `s` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains `t-4` test cases.
