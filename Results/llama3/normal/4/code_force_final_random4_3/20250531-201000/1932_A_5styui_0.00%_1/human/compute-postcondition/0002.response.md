Output State: **t is at least 2, a is greater than 0, i is 0, s is 0, d is an integer, b is a string, stdin contains t-2 test cases**

The code consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `d`. Since `t` is at least 2, there are at least 2 test cases in stdin. After reading one test case, there are `t-2` test cases left in stdin. The second line assigns the string value of the input to `b`. No other variables are affected.
