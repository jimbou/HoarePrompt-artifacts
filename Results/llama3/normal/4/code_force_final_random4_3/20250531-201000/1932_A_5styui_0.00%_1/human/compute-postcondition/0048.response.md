Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string equal to the input string that must have at least 1 character, `j` is 0, `s` is 0, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, the first character of `b` is not '@', the current value of `b[j]` is '*', and the current value of `b[j + 1]` is '*', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains `t-4` test cases, and the properties of the string `b` and its characters at indices `j` and `j+1` are preserved.
