Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `j` is 2, stdin contains t-2 test cases. If the character at index `j+1` in string `b` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues normally.***
