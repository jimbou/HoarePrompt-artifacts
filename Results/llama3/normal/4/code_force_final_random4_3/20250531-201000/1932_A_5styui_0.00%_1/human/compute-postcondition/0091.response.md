The code `break` breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is at least 2, `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a non-empty string, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
