Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters consisting of '.', '@', and '*' characters, a is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, s is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    d = int(input())
    b = input()
    for j in range(len(b)):
        if b[j] == '@':
            s = s + 1
        elif b[j] == '*':
            if b[:]:
                break
            elif b[j + 1] == '*':
                break
    print(s)
    s = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 2, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string, `j` is equal to the length of `b`, `s` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and the number of '@' characters in `b` which is `s` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 2, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string equal to the input string, `j` is equal to the length of `b`, `s` is 0, stdin contains t-4 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is at least 2, a is greater than 1, i is 2, d is an integer equal to the input value, b is a non-empty string, stdin contains t-5 test cases, j is equal to the length of b, and s is 0




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
