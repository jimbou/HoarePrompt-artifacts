Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `j` is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `t`, `a`, `i`, `d`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged. However, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside. The number of test cases in stdin remains the same, which is `t-2`.
