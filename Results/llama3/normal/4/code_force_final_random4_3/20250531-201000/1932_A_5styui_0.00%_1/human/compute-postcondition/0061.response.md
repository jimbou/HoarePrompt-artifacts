The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `b`. If `j` is less than `len(b)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `b` has at least 2 characters. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1 and `b` must have at least 3 characters.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string equal to the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `j` is 2, stdin contains `t-4` test cases. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 2. If the first character of `b` is '*', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `s` is not changed. If the first character of `b` is not '@' or '*', then we check the next character `b[j + 1]`. If `b[j + 1]` is '*', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `s` is not changed. Otherwise, `s` is 1 if the first character of `b` is '@' and `s` is 0 if the first character of `b` is not '@' or '*'.**
