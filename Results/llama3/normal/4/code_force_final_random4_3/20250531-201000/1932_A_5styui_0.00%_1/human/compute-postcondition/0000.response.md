Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters consisting of '.', '@', and '*' characters, a is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, s is 0.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the first test case to `a`. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `a` becomes an integer between 1 and 50. The second line assigns the value 0 to `s`. No other variables are affected.
