Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 2, a is greater than 0, i is 1, d is an integer equal to the input value, b is a string equal to the input string, j is equal to the length of b, s is 0, stdin contains t-4 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(b)):
    if b[j] == '@':
        s = s + 1
    elif b[j] == '*':
        if b[:]:
            break
        elif b[j + 1] == '*':
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is at least 2, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string equal to the input string that must have at least 1 character, `j` is 0, stdin contains `t-4` test cases. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. If the first character of `b` is '*', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first character of `b` is not '@' or '*', then we check the next character `b[j + 1]`. If `b[j + 1]` is '*', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s` is 0 and no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is at least 2, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string equal to the input string that must have at least 2 characters, `j` is 1, stdin contains `t-4` test cases. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 2. If the first character of `b` is '*', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `s` is not changed. If the first character of `b` is not '@' or '*', then we check the next character `b[j + 1]`. If `b[j + 1]` is '*', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `s` is not changed. Otherwise, `s` is 1 if the first character of `b` is '@' and `s` is 0 if the first character of `b` is not '@' or '*'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 2, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string equal to the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `j` is 2, stdin contains `t-4` test cases. If `b` is not empty and `b[j]` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 3 if `b[j]` is '@', otherwise `s` is 2. If the first character of `b` is '*', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `s` is not changed. If the first character of `b` is not '@' or '*', then we check the next character `b[j + 1]`. If `b[j + 1]` is '*', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `s` is not changed. Otherwise, `s` is 2 if the first character of `b` is '@' and `s` is 1 if the first character of `b` is not '@' or '*'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
