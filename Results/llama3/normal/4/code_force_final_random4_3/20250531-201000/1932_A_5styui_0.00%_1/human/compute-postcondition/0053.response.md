To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `b`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0 and `b` is a string with at least 1 character. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and `b` needs to have at least 2 characters.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string equal to the input string that must have at least 2 characters, `j` is 1, stdin contains `t-4` test cases. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. If the first character of `b` is '*', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first character of `b` is not '@' or '*', then we check the next character `b[j + 1]`. If `b[j + 1]` is '*', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s` is 0 and no change occurs.**
