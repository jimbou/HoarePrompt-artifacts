According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains t-1 test cases, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `a` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0. Also, since `a` is equal to the value of the first test case, it means that the first test case has already been processed, so `t` must be at least 2.

State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, `t` must be at least 2, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0**
