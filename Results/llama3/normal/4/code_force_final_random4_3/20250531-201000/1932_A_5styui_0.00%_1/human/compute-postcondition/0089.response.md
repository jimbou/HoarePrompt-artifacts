To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head `for j in range(len(b)):` and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head involves the variable `j` and the length of string `b`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than the length of `b`. Since `j` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **t is at least 2, a is greater than 1, i is 2, d is an integer equal to the input value, b is a non-empty string, stdin contains t-5 test cases, j is 1**
