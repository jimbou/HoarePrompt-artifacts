Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `j` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and the character at index `j` of string `b` is '*', and from this point on, the current value of the character at index `j` of string `b` is '*', and the string `b` is not empty and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `t`, `a`, `i`, `s`, `d`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t-2` test cases. The character at index `j` of string `b` is still '*', and the string `b` is still not empty.
