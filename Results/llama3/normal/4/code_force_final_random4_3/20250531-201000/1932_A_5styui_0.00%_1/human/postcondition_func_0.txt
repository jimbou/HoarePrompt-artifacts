This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a string of n characters. It then counts the number of '@' characters in each string and prints the count. The function repeats this process for all test cases, ignoring '*' characters and any characters that follow them in the string. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input stream with t-a-1 test cases remaining, where t is the initial number of test cases and a is the number of test cases processed.
