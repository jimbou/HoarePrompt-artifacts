Postcondition: **`t` is at least 2, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string equal to the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `j` is 2, stdin contains `t-4` test cases. If `b` is not empty and `b[j]` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 3 if `b[j]` is '@', otherwise `s` is 2. If the first character of `b` is '*', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `s` is not changed. If the first character of `b` is not '@' or '*', then we check the next character `b[j + 1]`. If `b[j + 1]` is '*', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `s` is not changed. Otherwise, `s` is 2 if the first character of `b` is '@' and `s` is 1 if the first character of `b` is not '@' or '*'.**
