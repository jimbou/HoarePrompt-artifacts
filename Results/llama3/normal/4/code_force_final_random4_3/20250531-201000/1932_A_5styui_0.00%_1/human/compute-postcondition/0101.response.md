Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is 3, `s` is unchanged. If the character at index `j+1` in string `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and stdin contains `t-5` test cases. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
