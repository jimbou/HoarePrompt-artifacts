To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(len(b)):`. The objects involved are `j` and `b`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 3.

The state of `b` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not modified by the loop iteration.

The other variables `t`, `a`, `i`, `d`, `s`, and `stdin` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is at least 2, `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a non-empty string, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `j` is 3, `s` is unchanged (as the character at index `j` in string `b` is not specified)**
