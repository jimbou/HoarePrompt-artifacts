Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to collect as many coins as possible while avoiding thorns. The issue lies in the way it handles the case when a cell with a coin is followed by a cell with thorns. In such cases, the program should not break the loop but instead, continue to the next cell. However, the current implementation breaks the loop as soon as it encounters a cell with thorns, which is incorrect.

Here's an example where the program does not work correctly:

Input:

    1
    5
    .@*@.*

Expected Output:

    2

Actual Output:

    1

In this example, the program should collect 2 coins but it only collects 1 because it breaks the loop as soon as it encounters the first cell with thorns.
