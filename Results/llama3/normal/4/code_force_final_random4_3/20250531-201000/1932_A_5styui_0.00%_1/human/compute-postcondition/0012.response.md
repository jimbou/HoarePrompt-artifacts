Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `j` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, the character at index `j` of string `b` is '*', the character at index `j+1` of string `b` is '*', the string `b` is not empty, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-2 test cases. The string `b` still has at least 2 characters, and the characters at indices `j` and `j+1` are still '*'.
