Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string, `j` is 0, `s` is 0, stdin contains t-5 test cases, the first character of string `b` is not '@', the current value of the character at index `j` of string `b` is undefined, and the character at index `j+1` of string `b` is '*', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `t`, `a`, `i`, `d`, `b`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-5` test cases, and the properties of the string `b` are also unchanged.
