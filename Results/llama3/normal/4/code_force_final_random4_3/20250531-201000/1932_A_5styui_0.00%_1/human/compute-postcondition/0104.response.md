Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is 3. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is '@', then `s` is incremented by 1. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is '*', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is not '@' and not '*', and the character at index `j+1` in string `b` is '*', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases. If none of the above conditions are met, `s` remains unchanged.***
