Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 2, a is greater than 0, i is 0, s is 0, d is an integer, b is a string, stdin contains t-2 test cases
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(b)):
    if b[j] == '@':
        s = s + 1
    elif b[j] == '*':
        if b[:]:
            break
        elif b[j + 1] == '*':
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is at least 2, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `j` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases. If the character at index `j` of string `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. If the character at index `j` of string `b` is '*', then if the string `b` is not empty, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the string `b` is empty and the character at index `j+1` of string `b` is '*', we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s` is 0 and no changes are made. If the character at index `j` of string `b` is neither '@' nor '*', then `s` is 0 and no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is at least 2, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `j` is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. If the second character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 1 more than its previous value. If the second character of `b` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is at least 2, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `j` is 2, stdin contains t-2 test cases. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is '@', then `s` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if string `b` is empty or the character at index `j+1` in string `b` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues normally.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
