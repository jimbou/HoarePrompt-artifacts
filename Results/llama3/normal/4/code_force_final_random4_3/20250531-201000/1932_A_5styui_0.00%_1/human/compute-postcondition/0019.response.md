The code `break` breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is at least 2, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `j` is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
