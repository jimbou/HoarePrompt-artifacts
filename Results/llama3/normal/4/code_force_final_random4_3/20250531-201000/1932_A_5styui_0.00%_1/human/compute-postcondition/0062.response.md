Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string equal to the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `j` is 2, stdin contains `t-4` test cases. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 3. If the first character of `b` is '*', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `s` is not changed. If the first character of `b` is not '@' or '*', then we check the next character `b[j + 1]`. If `b[j + 1]` is '*', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `s` is not changed. Otherwise, `s` is 2 if the first character of `b` is '@' and `s` is 1 if the first character of `b` is not '@' or '*'.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is now 3. If the first character of `b` is '*', then the value of `s` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first character of `b` is not '@' or '*', then we check the next character `b[j + 1]`. If `b[j + 1]` is '*', then the value of `s` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s` is now 2 if the first character of `b` is '@' and `s` is now 1 if the first character of `b` is not '@' or '*'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
