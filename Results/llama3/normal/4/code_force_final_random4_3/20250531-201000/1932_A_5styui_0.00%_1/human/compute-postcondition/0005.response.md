Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 1, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 1 character and the current character at index `j` is '@', `j` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still being at least 2, `a` still greater than 0, `i` still 0, `d` still an integer, `b` still a string with at least 1 character and the current character at index `j` still '@', and `j` still 0. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases.
