Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string equal to the input string that must have at least 1 character, `j` is 0, `s` is 0, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, and the first character of `b` is not '@'. If `b` is not empty, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b` is empty, we check the next character `b[j + 1]`. If `b[j + 1]` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
