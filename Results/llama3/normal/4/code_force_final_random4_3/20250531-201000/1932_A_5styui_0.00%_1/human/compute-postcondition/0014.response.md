Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `j` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and the character at index `j` of string `b` is '*'. If the string `b` is not empty, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the string `b` is empty and the character at index `j+1` of string `b` is '*', we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
