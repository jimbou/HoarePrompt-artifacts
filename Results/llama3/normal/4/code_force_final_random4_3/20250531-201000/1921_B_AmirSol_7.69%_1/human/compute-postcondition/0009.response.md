Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `counter` is 0, `i` is 1, and `s1[i-1]` is equal to `s2[i-1]`**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition `s1[i] is equal to s2[i]` is no longer valid because `i` has changed, but we can still say that `s1[i-1]` is equal to `s2[i-1]` because `i-1` is the previous value of `i`.
