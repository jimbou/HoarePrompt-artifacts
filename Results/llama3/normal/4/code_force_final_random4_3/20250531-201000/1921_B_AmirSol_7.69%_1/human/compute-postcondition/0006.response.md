Output State: **n is a positive integer, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters, counter is 1, i is 1, and the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s2[i]. Additionally, either i is greater than or equal to n - 1, or s1[i + 1] is equal to s2[i + 1], or s1[i] is equal to s1[i + 1].**

In this output state, the value of counter has been incremented by 1, and the value of i has been incremented by 1. The values of n, s1, and s2 remain unchanged. The condition that the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s2[i] still holds, and the additional conditions regarding i and the values of s1 and s2 at index i + 1 also remain valid.
