Postcondition: **n is a positive integer and greater than 1, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters. If s1[i] is not equal to s2[i], then counter is either 2 or 3, and i is either 4 or 3. If s1[i] is equal to s2[i], then n is a positive integer and greater than 1, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters. If s1[i-1] is not equal to s2[i-1], then counter is either 1 or 2, and i is either 4 or 3. Otherwise, counter is either 0 or 1, and i is either 3 or 4. n must be greater than the current value of i. i is increased by 1.**
