Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes into the desired state. The function `func_1` iterates through the two binary strings `s1` and `s2` and increments the counter whenever it finds a difference between the two strings. It also handles the case where two adjacent positions differ by incrementing the counter only once. This is in line with the problem description, which states that the scientists can perform one of three operations: add a cat, remove a cat, or move a cat from one box to another. The program's logic ensures that the minimum number of operations is performed to achieve the desired state.

Correctness: **True**
