To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition, which is `i < n`. 

Right before the loop, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer. Since `i` is already less than any positive integer, no adjustments are needed to the state of `i` or `n` for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged:

State: **n is a positive integer, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters, counter is 0, i is 0**
