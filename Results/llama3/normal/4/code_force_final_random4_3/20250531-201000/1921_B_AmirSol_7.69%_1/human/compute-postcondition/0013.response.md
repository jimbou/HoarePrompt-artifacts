Output State: **n is a positive integer and greater than 1, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters. If s1[i] is not equal to s2[i], then counter is 2 and either i is 3, the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s2[i], the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s1[i - 1], and the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s1[i + 1], or i is 2, the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s2[i], and either i is greater than or equal to n - 1, or s1[i + 1] is equal to s2[i + 1], or s1[i] is equal to s1[i + 1]. Otherwise, counter is 1, i is 2, and s1[i-1] is equal to s2[i-1], i is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `counter` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The conditions for `counter` and `i` have been updated accordingly. The values of `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged.
