Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters, counter is 0, i is 0
Code of the loop:
while i < n:
    if s1[i] != s2[i]:
        if i < n - 1 and s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1] and s1[i] != s1[i + 1]:
            counter += 1
            i += 2
        else:
            counter += 1
            i += 1
    else:
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is a positive integer, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters. If s1[i] is not equal to s2[i], then counter is 1 and either i is 2, the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s2[i], the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s1[i - 1], and the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s1[i + 1], or i is 1, the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s2[i], and either i is greater than or equal to n - 1, or s1[i + 1] is equal to s2[i + 1], or s1[i] is equal to s1[i + 1]. Otherwise, counter is 0, i is 1, and s1[i-1] is equal to s2[i-1].
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *n is a positive integer and greater than 1, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters. If s1[i] is not equal to s2[i], then counter is 2 and either i is 4, the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s2[i], the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s1[i - 1], and the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s1[i + 1], or i is 3, the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s2[i], and either i is greater than or equal to n - 1, or s1[i + 1] is equal to s2[i + 1], or s1[i] is equal to s1[i + 1]. Otherwise, counter is 1, i is 3, and s1[i-1] is equal to s2[i-1], i is 3. If s1[i] is not equal to s2[i], then counter is 2 and either i is 3, the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s2[i], the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s1[i - 1], and the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s1[i + 1], or i is 2, the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s2[i], and either i is greater than or equal to n - 1, or s1[i + 1] is equal to s2[i + 1], or s1[i] is equal to s1[i + 1]. Otherwise, counter is 1, i is 2, and s1[i-1] is equal to s2[i-1], i is 2. If s1[i] is equal to s2[i], then n is a positive integer and greater than 1, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters. If s1[i-1] is not equal to s2[i-1], then counter is 1 and either i-1 is 2, the current value of s1[i-1] is not equal to the current value of s2[i-1], the current value of s1[i-1] is not equal to the current value of s1[i-2], and the current value of s1[i-1] is not equal to the current value of s1[i], or i-1 is 1, the current value of s1[i-1] is not equal to the current value of s2[i-1], and either i-1 is greater than or equal to n - 1, or s1[i] is equal to s2[i], or s1[i-1] is equal to s1[i]. Otherwise, counter is 0, i is 2, and s1[i-1] is equal to s2[i-1].
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: n is a positive integer and greater than 1, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters. If s1[i] is not equal to s2[i], then counter is either 2 or 3, and i is either 4 or 3. If s1[i] is equal to s2[i], then n is a positive integer and greater than 1, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters. If s1[i-1] is not equal to s2[i-1], then counter is either 1 or 2, and i is either 4 or 3. Otherwise, counter is either 0 or 1, and i is either 3 or 4. n must be greater than the current value of i. i is increased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
