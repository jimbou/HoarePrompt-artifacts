Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters, counter is 1. If i < n - 1 and s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1] and (s1[i] != s1[i + 1]), then i is 2, the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s2[i], the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s1[i - 1], and the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s1[i + 1]. Otherwise, i is 1, the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s2[i], and either i is greater than or equal to n - 1, or s1[i + 1] is equal to s2[i + 1], or s1[i] is equal to s1[i + 1].***
