Output State: **n is a positive integer and greater than 1, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters. If s1[i] is not equal to s2[i], then counter is 3 and either i is 6, the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s2[i], the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s1[i - 1], and the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s1[i + 1], or i is 5, the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s2[i], and either i is greater than or equal to n - 1, or s1[i + 1] is equal to s2[i + 1], or s1[i] is equal to s1[i + 1]. Otherwise, counter is 2, i is 5, and s1[i-1] is equal to s2[i-1], i is 5. If s1[i] is equal to s2[i], then n is a positive integer and greater than 1, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters. If s1[i-1] is not equal to s2[i-1], then counter is 2 and either i-1 is 5, the current value of s1[i-1] is not equal to the current value of s2[i-1], the current value of s1[i-1] is not equal to the current value of s1[i-2], and the current value of s1[i-1] is not equal to the current value of s1[i], or i-1 is 4, the current value of s1[i-1] is not equal to the current value of s2[i-1], and either i-1 is greater than or equal to n - 1, or s1[i] is equal to s2[i], or s1[i-1] is equal to s1[i]. Otherwise, counter is 1, i is 5, and s1[i-1] is equal to s2[i-1]. n must be greater than the current value of i.**

In this output state, the value of `counter` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `i` has been incremented by 2. The conditions for `counter` and `i` have been updated accordingly, taking into account the new values of `i` and the relationships between `s1` and `s2`. The length of `s1` and `s2` remains the same, and `n` is still a positive integer greater than 1.
