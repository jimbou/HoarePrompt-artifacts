Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and greater than 1, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters. If `s1[i-1]` is not equal to `s2[i-1]`, then `counter` is 1 and either `i-1` is 2, the current value of `s1[i-1]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i-1]`, the current value of `s1[i-1]` is not equal to the current value of `s1[i-2]`, and the current value of `s1[i-1]` is not equal to the current value of `s1[i]`, or `i-1` is 1, the current value of `s1[i-1]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i-1]`, and either `i-1` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, or `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`, or `s1[i-1]` is equal to `s1[i]`. Otherwise, `counter` is 0, `i` is 2, and `s1[i-1]` is equal to `s2[i-1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The conditions for `counter` being 1 or 0 are still valid, but now they are applied to `i-1` instead of `i`. The values of `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain the same.
