Output State: **n is a positive integer and greater than 1, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters. If s1[i] is not equal to s2[i], then counter is 2 and either i is 4, the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s2[i], the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s1[i - 1], and the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s1[i + 1], or i is 3, the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s2[i], and either i is greater than or equal to n - 1, or s1[i + 1] is equal to s2[i + 1], or s1[i] is equal to s1[i + 1]. Otherwise, counter is 1, i is 3, and s1[i-1] is equal to s2[i-1], i is 3.**

Explanation: The first line increments the value of `counter` by 1. Since `counter` was initially 1, it becomes 2. The second line increments the value of `i` by 2. Since `i` was initially 1 or 2, it becomes 3 or 4. The rest of the state remains the same, as the code does not modify `n`, `s1`, or `s2`.
