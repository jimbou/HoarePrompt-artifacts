According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`, so `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **n is a positive integer and greater than 1, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters. If s1[i] is not equal to s2[i], then counter is 1 and either i is 2, the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s2[i], the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s1[i - 1], and the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s1[i + 1], or i is 1, the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s2[i], and either i is greater than or equal to n - 1, or s1[i + 1] is equal to s2[i + 1], or s1[i] is equal to s1[i + 1]. Otherwise, counter is 0, i is 1, and s1[i-1] is equal to s2[i-1], i is 1.**
