The only object in the loop head is variable  j and list  nodes, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nodes.  If the list has at least 3 nodes the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, nodes has at least 2 nodes, j is the second node in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 nodes and the j is the third node in the list.
State: **n is an integer greater than 1, x is a list of integers of length n, y is a list of integers of length n, r is a list of integers of length n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n, coef0 is a list of integers of length n with coef0[i] being 0, coef1 is a list of integers of length n with coef1[i] being 1, nodes is a list of nodes that must have at least 3 nodes, j is the third node in the list nodes, i is 1, ok is True, c0 is 0, c1 is 2, stdin contains no input.**
