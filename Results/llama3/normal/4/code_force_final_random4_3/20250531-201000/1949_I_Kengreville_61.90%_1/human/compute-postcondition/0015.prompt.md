Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[i] is True, nodes is a list of integers with i appended to the end, x and y are lists of integers of length n, and r is a list of positive integers of length n, coef0 and coef1 are lists of integers of length n.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    dx = x[i] - x[j]
    dy = y[i] - y[j]
    if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
        coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
        coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
        dfs(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, n is greater than 0, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[i] is True, nodes is a list of integers with i appended to the end, x and y are lists of integers of length n, r is a list of positive integers of length n, coef0 and coef1 are lists of integers of length n, dx is an integer equal to x[i] - x[0], and dy is an integer equal to y[i] - y[0]. If there exists an integer j such that 0 <= j < n, j is not visited, and the sum of the squares of r[i] and r[j] equals the sum of the squares of dx and dy, then visited[j] is set to True, nodes is appended with j, coef0[j] is set to r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i], and coef1[j] is set to -coef1[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, n is greater than 0, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[i] is True, nodes is a list of integers with i appended to the end, x and y are lists of integers of length n, r is a list of positive integers of length n, coef0 and coef1 are lists of integers of length n. If not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j])

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, n is greater than 0, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[i] is True. If not visited[j] and the sum of the squares of the radii of nodes i and j equals the sum of the squares of the differences in their x and y coordinates, then visited[j] is set to True, nodes is updated with i and j appended to the end, coef0[j] is set to r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i], and coef1[j] is set to -coef1[i]. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
