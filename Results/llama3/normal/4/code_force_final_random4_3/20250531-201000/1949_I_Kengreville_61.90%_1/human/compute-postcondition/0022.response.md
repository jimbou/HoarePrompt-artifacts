Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, x is a list of integers of length n, y is a list of integers of length n, r is a list of integers of length n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n, coef0 is a list of integers of length n with coef0[i] being 0, coef1 is a list of integers of length n with coef1[i] being 1, nodes is an empty list, i is 1, ok is True, c0 is 0, c1 is 0, j is undefined, stdin contains no input.**

In this final state, the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, and `visited` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The values of `coef0[i]` and `coef1[i]` were updated to 0 and 1, respectively, as specified in the code. The `nodes` list was reset to an empty list. The values of `i`, `ok`, `c0`, and `c1` were updated to 1, True, 0, and 0, respectively, as specified in the code. The value of `j` is undefined as it was not explicitly assigned a value in the code. Stdin remains empty as it was not used in the code.
