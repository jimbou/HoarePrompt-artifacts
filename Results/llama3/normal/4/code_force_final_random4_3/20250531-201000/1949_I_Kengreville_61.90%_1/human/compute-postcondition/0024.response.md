Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, x is a list of integers of length n, y is a list of integers of length n, r is a list of integers of length n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n, coef0 is a list of integers of length n with coef0[i] being 0, coef1 is a list of integers of length n with coef1[i] being 1, nodes is a list of nodes that must have at least 1 node, j is the first node in the list nodes, i is 1, ok is True, c0 is 0, c1 is 1, stdin contains no input.**

The code increments `c0` by the value of `coef0[j]`, which is 0, and `c1` by the value of `coef1[j]`, which is 1. As a result, `c0` remains 0 and `c1` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
