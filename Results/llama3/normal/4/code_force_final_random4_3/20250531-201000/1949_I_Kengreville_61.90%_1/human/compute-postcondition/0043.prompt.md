Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `x` is a list of integers of length `n` where `x[i]` is the first integer from the i-th input for all `i` in range(`n`), `y` is a list of integers of length `n` where `y[i]` is the second integer from the i-th input for all `i` in range(`n`), `r` is a list of integers of length `n` where `r[i]` is the third integer from the i-th input for all `i` in range(`n`), `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with all values set to False, `coef0` is a list of None values of length `n`, `coef1` is a list of None values of length `n`, `nodes` is an empty list, `i` is `n-1`, `ok` is False, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if not visited[i]:
        coef0[i] = 0
        coef1[i] = 1
        nodes = []
        dfs(i)
        c0 = 0
        c1 = 0
        for j in nodes:
            c0 += coef0[j]
            c1 += coef1[j]
        ok = ok or c1 != 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n`, `coef0` is a list of integers of length `n`, `coef1` is a list of integers of length `n`, `nodes` is a list, `i` is 0, `ok` is a boolean value, `c0` is an integer, `c1` is an integer, `j` is an integer, stdin contains no input. If the value at index `i` in `visited` is False, then `coef0[i]` is 0, `coef1[i]` is 1, `ok` is True, `c0` is 0, `c1` is the length of `nodes`, `j` is the last element in `nodes`. Otherwise, the values of `coef0`, `coef1`, `ok`, `c0`, `c1`, `j` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n`. If the value at index `i` in `visited` is False, then `coef0[i]` is 0, `coef1[i]` is 1, `ok` is True, `c0` is 0, `c1` is the length of `nodes`, `j` is the last element in `nodes`. Otherwise, the values of `coef0`, `coef1`, `ok`, `c0`, `c1`, `j` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than 1, x is a list of integers of length n, y is a list of integers of length n, r is a list of integers of length n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n. If the value at index i in visited is False, then coef0[j] is 0, coef1[j] is 1, nodes is a list that must have at least n elements, c0 is 0, c1 is n, i is increased by n, j is the last element in nodes, ok is True. Otherwise, the values of coef0, coef1, ok, c0, c1, j remain unchanged, i is increased by 1 and n must be greater than i.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
