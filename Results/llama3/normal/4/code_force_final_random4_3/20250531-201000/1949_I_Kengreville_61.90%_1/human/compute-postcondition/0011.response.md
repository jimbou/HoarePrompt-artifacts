To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(n):`. This means that the only variable in the loop head is `j`, and it will take on the next value in the range `n` on each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n
* `n` is greater than 0
* `visited` is a list of boolean values of length n where `visited[i]` is True
* `nodes` is a list of integers with `i` appended to the end
* `x` and `y` are lists of integers of length n
* `r` is a list of positive integers of length n
* `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers of length n

Since `j` is the only variable in the loop head, we can only adjust its state. To determine the next value of `j`, we need to consider the condition `range(n)`. Since `j` will take on the next value in the range `n`, we can increment `j` by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, `n` is greater than 0, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length n where `visited[i]` is True, `nodes` is a list of integers with `i` appended to the end, `x` and `y` are lists of integers of length n, `r` is a list of positive integers of length n, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers of length n, `j` is an integer such that 0 <= j < n and j > i**

Note that we cannot determine the exact value of `j`, but we can specify the range of values it can take on.
