Output State: **i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, n is greater than 0, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where all elements are True, nodes is a list of integers with all integers from 0 to n-1 appended to the end, x and y are lists of integers of length n, r is a list of positive integers of length n, coef0 and coef1 are lists of integers of length n.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where all nodes have been visited, and the nodes list contains all integers from 0 to n-1. The visited list is a list of boolean values where all elements are True, indicating that all nodes have been visited. The nodes list is a list of integers where all integers from 0 to n-1 are appended to the end, indicating that all nodes have been visited in the order they were encountered. The x, y, r, coef0, and coef1 lists remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
