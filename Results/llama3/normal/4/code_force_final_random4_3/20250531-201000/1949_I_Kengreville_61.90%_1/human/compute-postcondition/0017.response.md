Functionality: **This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a graph defined by the input parameters. It takes an integer `i` as input and marks it as visited. If `i` is not visited, it appends `i` to the `nodes` list and recursively calls the DFS function on all unvisited nodes `j` that are connected to `i` based on the condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2`, where `dx` and `dy` are the differences in `x` and `y` coordinates between `i` and `j`. The function also updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists based on the recursive calls. If all elements of the `visited` list are already True, the function does not modify the input parameters. The final state of the program is that all nodes in the graph are marked as visited, and the `nodes` list contains all integers from 0 to `n-1` if not all elements of `visited` were initially True.**
