Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, x is a list of integers of length n, y is a list of integers of length n, r is a list of integers of length n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n, coef0 is a list of integers of length n with coef0[i] being 0, coef1 is a list of integers of length n with coef1[i] being 1, nodes is a list of nodes that must have at least 2 nodes, j is the second node in the list nodes, i is 1, ok is True, c0 is 0, c1 is 2, stdin contains no input.**

The code modifies the values of `c0` and `c1`. The first line increments `c0` by the value of `coef0[j]`, which is 0, so `c0` remains 0. The second line increments `c1` by the value of `coef1[j]`, which is 1, making `c1` equal to 2. No other variables are affected.
