Output State: **i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, n is greater than 0, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[i] is True, nodes is a list of integers with i appended to the end, x and y are lists of integers of length n, r is a list of positive integers of length n, coef0 and coef1 are lists of integers of length n, dx is an integer equal to x[i] - x[j], and dy is an integer equal to y[i] - y[j].**

The code snippet modifies the values of dx and dy. The first line assigns the value of x[i] - x[j] to dx, and the second line assigns the value of y[i] - y[j] to dy. The values of dx and dy are updated based on the values of x[i], x[j], y[i], and y[j]. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
