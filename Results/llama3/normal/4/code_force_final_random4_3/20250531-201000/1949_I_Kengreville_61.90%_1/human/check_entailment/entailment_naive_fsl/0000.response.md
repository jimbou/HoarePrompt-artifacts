Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem description requires that the sum of all radii strictly decreases, but the program does not check this condition. 

In the function `func_1`, the variable `ok` is set to `True` if `c1 != 0`, but this does not guarantee that the sum of all radii strictly decreases. The program only checks if there is a cycle in the graph of tangent disks, but it does not check if the sum of the radii in the cycle is strictly decreasing.

For example, consider the case where there are three disks with radii 1, 2, and 3, and they are all tangent to each other. The program will set `ok` to `True` because `c1 != 0`, but the sum of the radii is not strictly decreasing.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
