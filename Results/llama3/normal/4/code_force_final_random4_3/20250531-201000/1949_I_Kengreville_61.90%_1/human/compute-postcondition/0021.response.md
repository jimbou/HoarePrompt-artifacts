The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n`, `coef0` is a list of integers of length `n`, `coef1` is a list of integers of length `n`, `nodes` is a list, `i` is 1, `ok` is a boolean value, `c0` is an integer, `c1` is an integer, `j` is an integer, stdin contains no input. If the value at index `i` in `visited` is False, then `coef0[i]` is 0, `coef1[i]` is 1, `ok` is True, `c0` is 0, `c1` is the length of `nodes`, `j` is the last element in `nodes`. Otherwise, the values of `coef0`, `coef1`, `ok`, `c0`, `c1`, `j` remain unchanged.**
