Postcondition: ***i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, n is greater than 0, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[i] is True, nodes is a list of integers with i appended to the end, x and y are lists of integers of length n, r is a list of positive integers of length n, coef0 and coef1 are lists of integers of length n. If not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2, then coef0[j] is r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i] and coef1[j] is -coef1[i].***
