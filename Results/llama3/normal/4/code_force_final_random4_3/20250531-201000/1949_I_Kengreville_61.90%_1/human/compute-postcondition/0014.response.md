Postcondition: ***i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, n is greater than 0, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[i] is True. If not visited[j] and the sum of the squares of the radii of nodes i and j equals the sum of the squares of the differences in their x and y coordinates, then visited[j] is set to True, nodes is updated with i and j appended to the end, coef0[j] is set to r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i], and coef1[j] is set to -coef1[i]. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
