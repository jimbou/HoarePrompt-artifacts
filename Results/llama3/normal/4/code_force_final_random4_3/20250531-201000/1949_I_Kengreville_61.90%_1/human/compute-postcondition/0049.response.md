Output: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, x is a list of integers of length n, y is a list of integers of length n, r is a list of integers of length n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where all values are set to True, coef0 is a list of integers of length n, coef1 is a list of integers of length n, nodes is a list, i is n, ok is False, c0 is an integer, c1 is an integer, j is an integer, stdin contains no input. If n is greater than 0, then coef0[i] is not necessarily 0, coef1[i] is not necessarily 1, ok is False, c0 is not necessarily 0, c1 is not necessarily the length of nodes, j is not necessarily the last element in nodes for all i in range(n). Otherwise, the values of coef0, coef1, ok, c0, c1, j remain unchanged. and 'NO' is printed**
