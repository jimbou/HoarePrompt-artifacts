To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `nodes`. Since `nodes` is currently an empty list, we need to adjust its state to have at least one element for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n`, `coef0[i]` is 0, `coef1[i]` is 1, `nodes` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `c0` is 0, `c1` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, `ok` remains unchanged, `j` is the first element in `nodes`**
