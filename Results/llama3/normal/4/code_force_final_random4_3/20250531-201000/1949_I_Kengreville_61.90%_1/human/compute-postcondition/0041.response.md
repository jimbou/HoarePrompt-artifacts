Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, x is a list of integers of length n, y is a list of integers of length n, r is a list of integers of length n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n, coef0[j] is 0, coef1[j] is 1, nodes is a list that must have at least n elements, c0 is 0, c1 is n, i is increased by n, j is the last element in nodes, ok is True**

In this output state, the value of ok is changed to True because c1 is n, which is not equal to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
