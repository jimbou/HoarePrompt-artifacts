Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n`, `coef0` is a list of integers of length `n`, `coef1` is a list of integers of length `n`, `nodes` is a list, `i` is 0, `ok` is a boolean value, `c0` is an integer, `c1` is an integer, `j` is an integer, stdin contains no input. If the value at index `i` in `visited` is False, then `coef0[i]` is 0, `coef1[i]` is 1, `ok` is True, `c0` is 0, `c1` is the length of `nodes`, `j` is the last element in `nodes`. Otherwise, the values of `coef0`, `coef1`, `ok`, `c0`, `c1`, `j` remain unchanged.***
