Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, x is a list of integers of length n, y is a list of integers of length n, r is a list of integers of length n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n, coef0[i] is 0, coef1[i] is 1, nodes is an empty list, c0 is 0, c1 is 0, i is increased by 1, ok remains unchanged, j remains unchanged.**

The code snippet modifies the values of coef0[i], coef1[i], nodes, c0, and c1. The values of coef0[i] and coef1[i] are set to 0 and 1, respectively. The list nodes is initialized as an empty list. The variables c0 and c1 are reset to 0. The variable i is incremented by 1, but its new value is not specified. The values of ok and j remain unchanged. The rest of the variables, including n, x, y, r, and visited, retain their initial values.
