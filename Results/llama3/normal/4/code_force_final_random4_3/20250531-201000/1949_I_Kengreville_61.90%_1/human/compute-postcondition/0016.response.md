Postcondition: ***i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, n is greater than 0, visited is a list of boolean values of length n, nodes is a list of integers, x and y are lists of integers of length n, and r is a list of positive integers of length n, coef0 and coef1 are lists of integers of length n. If not all elements of visited are True, then all elements of visited are set to True and nodes is appended with all integers from 0 to n-1. Otherwise, the values of visited, nodes, x, y, r, coef0, and coef1 remain unchanged.***
