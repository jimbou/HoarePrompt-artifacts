You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

If n is greater than 0, then coef0[i] is 0, coef1[i] is 1, ok is True, c0 is 0, c1 is the length of nodes, j is the last element in nodes for all i in range(n). Otherwise, the values of coef0, coef1, ok, c0, c1, j remain unchanged.

Otherwise, the values of coef0, coef1, ok, c0, c1, j remain unchanged.

Return Postconditions: Case_1: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, x is a list of integers of length n, y is a list of integers of length n, r is a list of integers of length n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where all values are set to True, coef0 is a list of integers of length n, coef1 is a list of integers of length n, nodes is a list, i is n, ok is True, c0 is an integer, c1 is an integer, j is an integer, stdin contains no input. If n is greater than 0, then the current value of coef0[i] is 0, coef1[i] is 1, c0 is 0, c1 is the length of nodes, j is the last element in nodes for all i in range(n), and 'YES' is printed

Case_2: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, x is a list of integers of length n, y is a list of integers of length n, r is a list of integers of length n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where all values are set to True, coef0 is a list of integers of length n, coef1 is a list of integers of length n, nodes is a list, i is n, ok is False, c0 is an integer, c1 is an integer, j is an integer, stdin contains no input. If n is greater than 0, then coef0[i] is not necessarily 0, coef1[i] is not necessarily 1, ok is False, c0 is not necessarily 0, c1 is not necessarily the length of nodes, j is not necessarily the last element in nodes for all i in range(n).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
