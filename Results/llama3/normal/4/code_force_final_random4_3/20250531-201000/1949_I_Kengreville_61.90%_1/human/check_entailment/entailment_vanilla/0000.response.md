Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to change the radii of a set of disks in the plane such that certain conditions are met. The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore the graph of disks and their tangency relationships.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program starts by reading the number of disks `n` and their coordinates and radii from the input. This is done correctly using the `input()` function and `map()` function to convert the input strings to integers.
2.  The program initializes several arrays to keep track of the visited status, coefficients, and nodes in the DFS traversal. This is done correctly using list comprehensions and assignments.
3.  The program defines a recursive DFS function `dfs(i)` that takes an index `i` as input. This function is used to traverse the graph of disks and their tangency relationships.
4.  Inside the `dfs(i)` function, the program checks if the current disk `i` has not been visited before. If not, it marks the disk as visited, adds it to the list of nodes, and iterates over all other disks `j` to check if they are tangent to disk `i`.
5.  If disk `j` is tangent to disk `i` and has not been visited before, the program updates the coefficients `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` based on the coefficients of disk `i` and the radii of disks `i` and `j`. This is done correctly using the formulas provided in the problem statement.
6.  The program then recursively calls the `dfs(j)` function to continue the traversal from disk `j`.
7.  After the DFS traversal is complete, the program checks if the sum of the coefficients `c1` is non-zero. If it is, the program sets the `ok` flag to `True`, indicating that it is possible to change the radii of the disks in the desired manner.
8.  Finally, the program prints "YES" if the `ok` flag is `True` and "NO" otherwise.

Based on this step-by-step analysis, the program appears to be correct. It correctly reads the input, initializes the necessary data structures, performs the DFS traversal, and checks the conditions for changing the radii of the disks.

Correctness: **True**
