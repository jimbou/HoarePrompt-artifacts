The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line sets the value of `visited[i]` to `True`, indicating that the node at index `i` has been visited. The second line appends the value of `i` to the end of the `nodes` list.

Output State: **i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[i] is True, nodes is a list of integers with i appended to the end, x and y are lists of integers of length n, and r is a list of positive integers of length n, coef0 and coef1 are lists of integers of length n.**
