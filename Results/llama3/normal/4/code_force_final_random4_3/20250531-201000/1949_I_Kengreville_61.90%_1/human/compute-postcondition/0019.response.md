Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n`, `coef0` is a list of integers of length `n` where `coef0[i]` is 0, `coef1` is a list of integers of length `n` where `coef1[i]` is 1, `nodes` is a list, `i` is 0, `ok` is True, `c0` is 0, `c1` is the length of `nodes`, `j` is the last element in `nodes`, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `ok` has been updated to True because `c1` is the length of `nodes` and is not equal to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
