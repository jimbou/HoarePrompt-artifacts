Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, x is a list of integers of length n, y is a list of integers of length n, r is a list of integers of length n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n, coef0[j] is 0, coef1[j] is 1, nodes is a list that must have at least 2 elements, c0 is 0, c1 is 2, i is increased by 1, ok remains unchanged, j is the second element in nodes**

In this output state, the values of `c0` and `c1` have been updated. `c0` remains 0 because `coef0[j]` is 0, and `c1` becomes 2 because `coef1[j]` is 1 and `c1` was initially 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
