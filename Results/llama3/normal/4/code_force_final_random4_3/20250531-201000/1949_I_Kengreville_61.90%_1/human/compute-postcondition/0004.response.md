Postcondition: **i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, n is greater than 0, j is 0, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[i] is True, nodes is a list of integers with i appended to the end, x and y are lists of integers of length n, r is a list of positive integers of length n, coef0 and coef1 are lists of integers of length n, dx is an integer equal to x[i] - x[0], and dy is an integer equal to y[i] - y[0]. The current value of visited[j] is False and the sum of the squares of r[i] and r[j] is equal to the sum of the squares of dx and dy.**
