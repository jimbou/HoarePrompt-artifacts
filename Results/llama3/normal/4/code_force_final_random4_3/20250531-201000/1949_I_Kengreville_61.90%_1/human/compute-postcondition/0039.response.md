Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, x is a list of integers of length n, y is a list of integers of length n, r is a list of integers of length n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n, coef0[j] is 0, coef1[j] is 1, nodes is a list that must have at least 3 elements, c0 is 0, c1 is 3, i is increased by 1, ok remains unchanged, j is the third element in nodes**

The code block increments `c0` by the value of `coef0[j]`, which is 0, and `c1` by the value of `coef1[j]`, which is 1. Since `c0` was initially 0 and `c1` was initially 2, `c0` remains 0 and `c1` becomes 3. No other variables are affected by the code block.
