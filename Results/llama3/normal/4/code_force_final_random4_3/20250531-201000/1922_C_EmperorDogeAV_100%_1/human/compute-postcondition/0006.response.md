Postcondition: **cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer greater than 1, prog_cities is a list of n-1 zeros. The current value of i is less than n-1. If the current value of i is greater than 0, back is equal to the value of the city at index i-1, and forward is 999999999999999999. Otherwise, the values of back and forward remain unchanged.**
