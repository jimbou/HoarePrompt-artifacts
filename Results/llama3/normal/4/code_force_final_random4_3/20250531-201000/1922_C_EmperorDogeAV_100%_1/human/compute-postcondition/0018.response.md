Output State: **cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer greater than 1, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers. If i > 0, then back is the current city in the list cities, otherwise back remains -99999999999999999999. forward is the (i+2)th city in the list cities.**
