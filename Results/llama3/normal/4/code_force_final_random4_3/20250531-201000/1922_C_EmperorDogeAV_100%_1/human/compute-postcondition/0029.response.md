Output State: **`cities` is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers where the i-th element is 1, `i` is n - 1, `back` is the second last element of `cities`, and `forward` is the last element of `cities`.**

In this output state, the value of `prog_cities[i]` has been updated to 1, and the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still `n - 1`, and `back` and `forward` are still the second last and last elements of `cities`, respectively.
