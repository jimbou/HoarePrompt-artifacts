Output State: **`cities` is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers where the value at index `i` is the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`, `i` is less than n-1, if `i` is greater than 0, `back` is equal to the value of the city at index `i-1`, and `forward` is equal to the value of the city at index `i+1`, the absolute difference between `forward` and the city at index `i` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between the city at index `i` and `back`.**

In this output state, the value of `prog_cities[i]` has been updated to be the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `i`, `back`, and `forward` are still valid, and the relationship between `forward`, `cities[i]`, and `back` is still maintained.
