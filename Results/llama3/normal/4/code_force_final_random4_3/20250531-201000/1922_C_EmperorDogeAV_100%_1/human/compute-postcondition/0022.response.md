Postcondition: **cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer greater than 1, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers. If the absolute difference between the (i+2)th city in the list cities and the ith city in the list cities is less than the absolute difference between the ith city in the list cities and the current city in the list cities, then the ith element of prog_cities is 1. Otherwise, the ith element of prog_cities is the absolute difference between the (i+2)th city in the list cities and the ith city in the list cities. If i > 0, then back is the current city in the list cities, otherwise back remains -99999999999999999999. If i < n - 1, then forward is the (i+2)th city in the list cities. Otherwise, forward remains 999999999999999999.**
