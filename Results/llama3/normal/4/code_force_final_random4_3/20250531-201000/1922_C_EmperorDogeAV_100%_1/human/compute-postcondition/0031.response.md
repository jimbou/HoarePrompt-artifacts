Postcondition: ***`cities` is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. If the absolute difference between the last element of `cities` and the i-th element of `cities` is less than the absolute difference between the i-th element of `cities` and the second last element of `cities`, then `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers where the i-th element is 1, `i` is n - 1, `back` is the second last element of `cities`, and `forward` is the last element of `cities`. Otherwise, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers where the i-th element is the absolute difference between the last element of `cities` and the i-th element of `cities`, `i` is either n - 1 or remains unchanged, `back` is the second last element of `cities` or remains unchanged, and `forward` is the last element of `cities` or remains unchanged.***
