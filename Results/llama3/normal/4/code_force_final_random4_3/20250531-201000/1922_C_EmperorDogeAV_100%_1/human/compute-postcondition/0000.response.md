Output State: **cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer, prog_cities is a list of n-1 zeros**

In this output state, the code has created a new list called prog_cities, which contains n-1 zeros. The original list cities and the variable n remain unchanged. The length of prog_cities is one less than the length of cities, as specified by the expression n-1.
