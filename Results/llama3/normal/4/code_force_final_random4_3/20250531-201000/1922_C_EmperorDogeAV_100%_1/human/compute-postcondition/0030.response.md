Output State: **`cities` is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers where the i-th element is the absolute difference between the last element of `cities` and the i-th element of `cities`, `i` is either n - 1 or remains unchanged, `back` is the second last element of `cities` or remains unchanged, and `forward` is the last element of `cities` or remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `prog_cities[i]` has been updated to be the absolute difference between the last element of `cities` and the i-th element of `cities`. The values of `i`, `back`, and `forward` are either updated or remain unchanged based on the condition `i < n - 1`. The other variables, `cities` and `n`, remain unchanged.
