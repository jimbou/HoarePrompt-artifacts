The value of `back` is updated to `cities[i - 1]`. Since `i` is the current index plus 1, `i - 1` is the current index. Therefore, `back` is assigned the value of the current city in the list `cities`.

Output State: **`cities` is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers, `i` is the current index plus 1, `back` is the current city in the list `cities`, `forward` is 999999999999999999**
