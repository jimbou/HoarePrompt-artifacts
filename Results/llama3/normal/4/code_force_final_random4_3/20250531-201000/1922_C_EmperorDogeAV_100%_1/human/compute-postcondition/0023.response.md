To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is not explicitly stated, but we can infer that it is equal to `n - 2` because the loop has executed `n - 2` times.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes `n - 1`.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.

The state of `cities`, `prog_cities`, `back`, and `forward` are not directly affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`cities` is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers, `i` is n - 1, `back` is the (n-2)th city in the list cities, `forward` is 999999999999999999**
