Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer, prog_cities is a list of n-1 zeros
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    back = -99999999999999999999
    forward = 999999999999999999
    if i > 0:
        back = cities[i - 1]
    if i < n - 1:
        forward = cities[i + 1]
    if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
        prog_cities[i] = 1
    else:
        prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer greater than 1, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers. If the current value of i is less than n-1, then if the current value of i is greater than 0, back is equal to the value of the city at index i-1, and forward is equal to the value of the city at index i+1. Otherwise, the values of back and forward remain unchanged. If the absolute difference between forward and the city at index i is less than the absolute difference between the city at index i and back, then the ith element of prog_cities is 1 and the rest are zeros. Otherwise, the ith element of prog_cities is the absolute difference between forward and cities[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer greater than 1, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers. If the absolute difference between the (i+2)th city in the list cities and the ith city in the list cities is less than the absolute difference between the ith city in the list cities and the current city in the list cities, then the ith element of prog_cities is 1. Otherwise, the ith element of prog_cities is the absolute difference between the (i+2)th city in the list cities and the ith city in the list cities. If i > 0, then back is the current city in the list cities, otherwise back remains -99999999999999999999. If i < n - 1, then forward is the (i+2)th city in the list cities. Otherwise, forward remains 999999999999999999.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cities` is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. If the absolute difference between the last element of `cities` and the i-th element of `cities` is less than the absolute difference between the i-th element of `cities` and the second last element of `cities`, then `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers where the i-th element is 1, `i` is n - 1, `back` is the second last element of `cities`, and `forward` is the last element of `cities`. Otherwise, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers where the i-th element is the absolute difference between the last element of `cities` and the i-th element of `cities`, `i` is either n - 1 or remains unchanged, `back` is the second last element of `cities` or remains unchanged, and `forward` is the last element of `cities` or remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
