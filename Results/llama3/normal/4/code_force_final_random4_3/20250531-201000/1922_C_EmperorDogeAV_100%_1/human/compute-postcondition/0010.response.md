Output State: **cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer greater than 1, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers where the ith element is 1 and the rest are zeros, i is less than n-1, if the current value of i is greater than 0, back is equal to the value of the city at index i-1, and forward is equal to the value of the city at index i+1. Otherwise, the values of back and forward remain unchanged. The absolute difference between forward and the city at index i is less than the absolute difference between the city at index i and back.**

In this output state, the only change is that the ith element of prog_cities is now 1, while the rest of the elements remain the same. The values of cities, n, i, back, and forward are unchanged.
