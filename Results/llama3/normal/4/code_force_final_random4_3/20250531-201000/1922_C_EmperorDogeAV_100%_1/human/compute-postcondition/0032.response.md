Output State: **cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer greater than 1, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers. If the absolute difference between the last element of cities and the i-th element of cities is less than the absolute difference between the i-th element of cities and the second last element of cities, then the i-th element of prog_cities is 1. Otherwise, the i-th element of prog_cities is the absolute difference between the last element of cities and the i-th element of cities.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `cities` remains unchanged, `n` remains a positive integer greater than 1, and `prog_cities` is a list of `n-1` integers. For each element `i` in `prog_cities`, if the absolute difference between the last element of `cities` and the `i-th` element of `cities` is less than the absolute difference between the `i-th` element of `cities` and the second last element of `cities`, then the `i-th` element of `prog_cities` is 1. Otherwise, the `i-th` element of `prog_cities` is the absolute difference between the last element of `cities` and the `i-th` element of `cities`.
