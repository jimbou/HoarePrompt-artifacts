Output State: **cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer greater than 1, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers, i is n - 1, back is -99999999999999999999, forward is 999999999999999999**

The code snippet consists of two lines, each assigning a new value to the variables `back` and `forward`, respectively. The initial values of `back` and `forward` are updated to the specified values. The other variables, `cities`, `n`, `prog_cities`, and `i`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
