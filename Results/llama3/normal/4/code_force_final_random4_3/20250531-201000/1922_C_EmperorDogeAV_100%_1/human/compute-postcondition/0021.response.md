Output State: **`cities` is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers where the ith element is the absolute difference between the (i+2)th city in the list `cities` and the ith city in the list `cities`, `i` is an integer, if `i` > 0, then `back` is the current city in the list `cities`, otherwise `back` remains -99999999999999999999, if `i` < `n` - 1, then `forward` is the (i+2)th city in the list `cities`, otherwise `forward` remains 999999999999999999.**

In this output state, the value of `prog_cities[i]` has been updated to be the absolute difference between the (i+2)th city in the list `cities` and the ith city in the list `cities`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
