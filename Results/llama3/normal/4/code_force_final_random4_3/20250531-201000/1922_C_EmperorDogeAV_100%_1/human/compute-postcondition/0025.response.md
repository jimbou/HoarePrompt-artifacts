Output State: **cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer greater than 1, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers, i is n - 1, back is the second last element of cities, forward is 999999999999999999**

In this output state, the value of `back` has been updated to be the second last element of the list `cities`, since `i` is `n - 1` and `cities[i - 1]` refers to the second last element of the list. The other variables remain unchanged.
