Postcondition: ***cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer greater than 1, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers. If the current value of i is less than n-1, then if the current value of i is greater than 0, back is equal to the value of the city at index i-1, and forward is equal to the value of the city at index i+1. Otherwise, the values of back and forward remain unchanged. If the absolute difference between forward and the city at index i is less than the absolute difference between the city at index i and back, then the ith element of prog_cities is 1 and the rest are zeros. Otherwise, the ith element of prog_cities is the absolute difference between forward and cities[i].***
