Output State: **cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer greater than 1, prog_cities is a list of n-1 zeros. The current value of i is less than n-1. If the current value of i is greater than 0, back is equal to the value of the city at index i-1, and forward is equal to the value of the city at index i+1. Otherwise, the values of back and forward remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of forward has been updated to be equal to the value of the city at index i+1 in the list of cities. The other variables remain unchanged. The list of cities, the value of n, and the list of prog_cities are still the same. The value of i is still less than n-1. The value of back is still equal to the value of the city at index i-1 if i is greater than 0, and remains unchanged otherwise.
