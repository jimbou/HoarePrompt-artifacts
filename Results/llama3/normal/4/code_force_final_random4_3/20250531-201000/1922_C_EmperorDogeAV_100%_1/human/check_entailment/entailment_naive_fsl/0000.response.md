Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. The `func_1` function correctly determines the closest city for each city in the list. It checks the distance to the previous city (if it exists) and the next city (if it exists) and chooses the one with the smaller distance. If the next city is closer, it sets the cost to 1; otherwise, it sets the cost to the distance to the next city.

2. The program then calculates the prefix sums of the costs in both the forward and backward directions. This allows it to efficiently calculate the total cost of traveling from one city to another by simply subtracting the prefix sums.

3. The program handles queries by checking if the destination city is to the left or right of the source city. If it's to the right, it uses the forward prefix sum; otherwise, it uses the backward prefix sum.

The program correctly handles all edge cases, including:

* When the source and destination cities are the same (in which case the cost is 0).
* When the source city is the first city and the destination city is the last city (in which case the program uses the forward prefix sum).
* When the source city is the last city and the destination city is the first city (in which case the program uses the backward prefix sum).

Overall, the program accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases correctly.
