Output State: **cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer greater than 1, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers where the ith element is 1, If i > 0, then back is the current city in the list cities, otherwise back remains -99999999999999999999. If i < n - 1, then forward is the (i+2)th city in the list cities. Otherwise, forward remains 999999999999999999.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of cities remains unchanged, the number of cities remains the same, the list of progressed cities now has the ith element set to 1, the current city, the previous city, and the next city remain the same as before the code execution.
