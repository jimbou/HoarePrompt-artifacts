Output State: **cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer greater than 1, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers. If i > 0, then i is n - 1, back is the second last element of cities, and forward is the last element of cities. Otherwise, the values of i, back, and forward remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `forward` has been updated to be the last element of `cities` when `i` is greater than 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `cities` is still in ascending order, and `n` is still a positive integer greater than 1. The list `prog_cities` also remains unchanged.
