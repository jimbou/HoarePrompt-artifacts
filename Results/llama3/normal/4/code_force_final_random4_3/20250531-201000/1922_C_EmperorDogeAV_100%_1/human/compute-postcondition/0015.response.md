Output State: **cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer greater than 1, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers, i is the current index plus 1, back is -99999999999999999999, forward is 999999999999999999**

The code snippet assigns new values to the variables `back` and `forward`. The first line sets `back` to a very large negative number, and the second line sets `forward` to a very large positive number. These assignments do not affect any other variables. The values of `cities`, `n`, `prog_cities`, and `i` remain unchanged.
