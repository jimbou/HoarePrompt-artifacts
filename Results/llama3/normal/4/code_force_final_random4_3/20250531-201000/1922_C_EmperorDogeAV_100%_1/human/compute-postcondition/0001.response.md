The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer, prog_cities is a list of n-1 zeros does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 and i is now 0. 
State: **cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer that must be greater than 1, prog_cities is a list of n-1 zeros, i is 0**
