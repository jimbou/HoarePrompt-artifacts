Postcondition: ***cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer greater than 1, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers. If i > 0, then i is n - 1, back is the second last element of cities, and forward is 999999999999999999. Otherwise, the values of i, back, and forward remain unchanged.***
