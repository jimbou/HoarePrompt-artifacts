    #State: cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer greater than 1, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers. If the absolute difference between the last element of cities and the i-th element of cities is less than the absolute difference between the i-th element of cities and the second last element of cities, then the i-th element of prog_cities is 1. Otherwise, the i-th element of prog_cities is the absolute difference between the last element of cities and the i-th element of cities.
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns a list of n-1 integers, where each integer represents the absolute difference between the last element of the list 'cities' and the corresponding element of 'cities', or 1 if the absolute difference between the last element of 'cities' and the corresponding element of 'cities' is less than the absolute difference between the corresponding element of 'cities' and the second last element of 'cities'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the absolute difference between each city in the list (except the last one) and the last city, or sets it to 1 if the difference between the current city and the last city is less than the difference between the current city and the previous city. It returns a list of these calculated values.
