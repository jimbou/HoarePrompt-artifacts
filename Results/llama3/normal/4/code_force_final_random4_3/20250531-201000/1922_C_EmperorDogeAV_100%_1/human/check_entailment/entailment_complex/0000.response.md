Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where we have a list of cities located on a number line, and we need to calculate the minimum number of coins required to travel from one city to another. The program uses a function `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost to travel from each city to the next city, and then uses prefix sums to calculate the minimum cost to travel from one city to another.

The function `func_1` takes a list of cities and the number of cities as input, and returns a list of minimum costs to travel from each city to the next city. The function works by iterating over the list of cities, and for each city, it calculates the minimum cost to travel to the next city. If the next city is closer to the current city than the previous city, the minimum cost is 1. Otherwise, the minimum cost is the absolute difference between the current city and the next city.

The main program uses the `func_1` function to calculate the minimum costs to travel from each city to the next city in both the forward and backward directions. It then uses prefix sums to calculate the minimum cost to travel from one city to another.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost to travel from one city to another. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the minimum cost to travel from each city to the next city, and the main program correctly uses prefix sums to calculate the minimum cost to travel from one city to another.

Correctness: **True**
