The only variable in the loop head is variable  x and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 3 elements, x is the first element of a. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the x is the second element of a and cnt is either `math.floor(x / 2)` or `1 + math.floor(x / 2)`, depending on whether the first three elements of `a` are odd or not.
State: **`a` is a list of integers from stdin that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element of `a`, `cnt` is either `math.floor(x / 2)` or `1 + math.floor(x / 2)`, depending on whether the first three elements of `a` are odd or not.**
