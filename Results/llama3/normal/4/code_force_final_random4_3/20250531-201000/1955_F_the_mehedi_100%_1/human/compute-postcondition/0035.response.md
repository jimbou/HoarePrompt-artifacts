To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states accordingly.


The loop head is `for x in a:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `x` and `a`.


At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is the second integer in the list `a`. For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 3 integers, and `x` should be the third integer in the list.


The value of `cnt` is not relevant to the loop head, so we don't need to adjust it.


State: **`cnt` is either 1 + `x/2` + `x/2` if `x` is even or 1 + `(x-1)/2` + `x/2` if `x` is odd, `a` is a list of integers from stdin with at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list `a`.**
