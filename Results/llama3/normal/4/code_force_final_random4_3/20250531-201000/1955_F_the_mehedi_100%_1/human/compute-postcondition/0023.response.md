Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from stdin that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element of `a`, `cnt` is either `3 * math.floor(x / 2)` or `2 + 2 * math.floor(x / 2)`, depending on whether the first three elements of `a` are odd or not.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been updated by adding `math.floor(x / 2)` to its previous value. The previous value of `cnt` was either `2 * math.floor(x / 2)` or `1 + 2 * math.floor(x / 2)`, depending on whether the first three elements of `a` are odd or not. Therefore, the new value of `cnt` is either `3 * math.floor(x / 2)` or `2 + 2 * math.floor(x / 2)`, respectively. The values of `a` and `x` remain unchanged.
