Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
        cnt += 1
    for x in a:
        cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
    print(cnt)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is the sum of the integer parts of half of all elements in the initial list `a` plus 1 if all the first three elements of `a` are odd numbers, otherwise `cnt` is the sum of the integer parts of half of all elements in the initial list `a`, `x` is the last element of the initial list `a`, and the value of `cnt` which is 0 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: cnt is the sum of math.floor(x / 2) for all x in a, and x is the last element of a, and cnt is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: cnt is the sum of the integer division of each integer in the list `a` by 2, plus 1 if the first three integers from stdin are all odd, otherwise cnt remains 0. a is a list of integers from stdin and stdin is empty. x is the last integer in the list `a`. The value of cnt which is 0 is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
