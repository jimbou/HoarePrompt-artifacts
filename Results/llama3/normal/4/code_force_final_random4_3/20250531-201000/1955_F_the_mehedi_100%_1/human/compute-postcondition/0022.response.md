To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `a` and `x`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `a` has at least one more element. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 2 elements, and `x` is the second element of `a`. For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 3 elements, and `x` must be the third element of `a`.

The value of `cnt` is not relevant to the loop head, so we don't need to adjust it.

State: **`a` is a list of integers from stdin that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element of `a`, `cnt` is either `2 * math.floor(x / 2)` or `1 + 2 * math.floor(x / 2)`, depending on whether the first three elements of `a` are odd or not.**
