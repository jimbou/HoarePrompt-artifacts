Output State: **`a` is a list of four integers that must have at least 2 elements, `cnt` is the integer part of half of the first element of `a` plus 1 plus the integer part of half of the second element of `a` plus the integer part of half of the third element of `a` if the first three elements of `a` are odd numbers, otherwise `cnt` is the integer part of half of the first element of `a` plus the integer part of half of the second element of `a` plus the integer part of half of the third element of `a`, `x` is the third element of `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been updated by adding the integer part of half of the third element of `a` to its previous value. The other variables, `a` and `x`, remain unchanged. The condition on `cnt` still depends on whether the first three elements of `a` are odd numbers or not.
