The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. If the value is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `int(input())` is greater than 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), int(input()) is greater than 0**
