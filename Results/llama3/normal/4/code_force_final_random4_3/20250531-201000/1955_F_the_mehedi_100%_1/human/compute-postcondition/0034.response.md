Output State: **`cnt` is either 1 + `x/2` + `x/2` if `x` is even or 1 + `(x-1)/2` + `x/2` if `x` is odd, `a` is a list of integers from stdin with at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` has been updated by adding the integer part of `x` divided by 2. The value of `a` and `x` remains the same.
