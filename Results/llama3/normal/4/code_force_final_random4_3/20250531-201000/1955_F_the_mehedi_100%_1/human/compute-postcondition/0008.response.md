Output State: **`a` is a list of four integers that must have at least 2 elements, `cnt` is the integer part of half of the first element of `a` plus 1 plus the integer part of half of the second element of `a` if the first three elements of `a` are odd numbers, otherwise `cnt` is the integer part of half of the first element of `a` plus the integer part of half of the second element of `a`, `x` is the second element of `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been updated by adding the integer part of half of the second element of `a` to its previous value. The previous value of `cnt` was dependent on whether the first three elements of `a` were odd numbers or not. If they were odd, `cnt` was 1 plus the integer part of half of the first element of `a`, otherwise it was just the integer part of half of the first element of `a`. Now, `cnt` is the sum of its previous value and the integer part of half of the second element of `a`. The values of `a` and `x` remain unchanged.
