Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `a` is a list of integers from stdin, stdin is empty, `x` is undefined**

The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1, so its new value is 1. The other variables remain unchanged: `a` is still a list of integers from stdin, stdin is still empty, and `x` is still undefined.
