To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

Initial State: 
- `cnt` is either `1 + x/2 + x/2` if `x` is even or `1 + (x-1)/2 + x/2` if `x` is odd.
- `a` is a list of integers from stdin with at least 3 integers.
- `x` is the third integer in the list `a`.

Given Code:
```python
cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
```

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The value of `cnt` is incremented by `math.floor(x / 2)`.
2. `math.floor(x / 2)` will truncate the decimal part of `x / 2` and return the largest possible integer.
3. If `x` is even, `x / 2` will be an integer, so `math.floor(x / 2)` will be equal to `x / 2`.
4. If `x` is odd, `x / 2` will have a decimal part, so `math.floor(x / 2)` will be equal to `(x - 1) / 2`.

Now, let's update the value of `cnt` based on the initial state:

- If `x` is even, `cnt` becomes `1 + x/2 + x/2 + x/2 = 1 + 3x/2`.
- If `x` is odd, `cnt` becomes `1 + (x-1)/2 + x/2 + (x-1)/2 = 1 + x - 1 + x/2 = x + x/2`.

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`cnt` is either `1 + 3x/2` if `x` is even or `x + x/2` if `x` is odd, `a` is a list of integers from stdin with at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list `a`.**
