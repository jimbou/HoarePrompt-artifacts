The only objects in the loop head are variables  x and list  a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least one integer, x is the first integer in the list a. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the x is the second integer in the list a.
State: **`cnt` is either 1 + `x/2` if `x` is even or 1 + `(x-1)/2` if `x` is odd, `a` is a list of integers from stdin with at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list `a`.**
