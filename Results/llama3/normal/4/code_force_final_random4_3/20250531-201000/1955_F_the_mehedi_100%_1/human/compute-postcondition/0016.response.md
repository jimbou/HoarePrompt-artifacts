Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from stdin, `cnt` is 1, `x` is undefined, and the value of `cnt` which is 1 is being printed**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The value of `cnt` is being printed, which means the current value of `cnt` (1) is being output. The other variables, `a` and `x`, remain unchanged.
