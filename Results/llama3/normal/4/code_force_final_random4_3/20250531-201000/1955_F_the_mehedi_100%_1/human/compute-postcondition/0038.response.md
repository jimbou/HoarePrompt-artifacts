To determine what will be printed when the statement `print(cnt)` executes, let's break down the initial state and the formula for calculating `cnt`.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `cnt` is a variable that depends on the sum of the integer division of each integer in the list `a` by 2, and a condition based on the first three integers from `stdin`.
   - `a` is a list of integers from `stdin`.
   - `stdin` is empty.
   - `x` is the last integer in the list `a`, but its value isn't directly relevant to calculating `cnt`.

2. **Calculating `cnt`**:
   - The sum of the integer division of each integer in `a` by 2: Since `stdin` is empty, `a` is also empty. Therefore, there are no integers to divide by 2, making this part of the sum 0.
   - Plus 1 if the first three integers from `stdin` are all odd: Since `stdin` is empty, there are no integers to check for being odd. Therefore, this condition cannot be met, and `cnt` does not increase by 1.

Given these considerations, `cnt` remains 0 because there are no integers in `a` to contribute to the sum, and the condition to increase `cnt` by 1 cannot be satisfied due to the empty `stdin`.

Output: **0**
