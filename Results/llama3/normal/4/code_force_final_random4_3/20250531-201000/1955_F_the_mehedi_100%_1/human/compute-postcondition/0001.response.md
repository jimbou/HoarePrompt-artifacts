Output State: **a is a list of four integers, cnt is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers**.

In this output state, the variable `a` now holds a list of four integers, which were read from the first line of the input. The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0 and remains unchanged. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines, each with four integers, as the first line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
