Functionality: **This function reads a series of lines from standard input, where each line contains four integers. For each line, it calculates a count (cnt) that is the sum of the integer parts of half of all elements in the line, plus 1 if all the first three elements are odd numbers. It then prints this count. The function processes multiple lines as specified by an initial integer input (t), repeating the calculation and printing process for each line.**
