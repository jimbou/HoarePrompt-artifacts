Output State: **cnt is 0, a is a list of integers from stdin, stdin is empty, x is undefined**

The code first assigns a list of integers from stdin to `a`, making `a` a list of integers. The second line assigns 0 to `cnt`, making `cnt` equal to 0. The previous value of `cnt` is no longer valid. The value of `x` is no longer defined, as it is not assigned a value in the code. Stdin is now empty, as all input values have been read.
