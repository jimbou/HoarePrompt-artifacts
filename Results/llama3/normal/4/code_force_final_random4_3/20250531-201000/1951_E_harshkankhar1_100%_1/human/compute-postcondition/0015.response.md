Output State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of s and must be greater than 2, func_1(s[0:]) returns True, i is 2, x is 2**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `x`, making `x` equal to 2. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. No other variables are affected.
