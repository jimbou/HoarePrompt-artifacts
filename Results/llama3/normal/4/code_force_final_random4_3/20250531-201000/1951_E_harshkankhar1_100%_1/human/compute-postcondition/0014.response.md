To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, we can increment `i` by 1 to get the new value.

So, the adjusted state is:

State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `func_1(s[0:])` returns True, `i` is 2**

Note that we don't need to adjust the value of `x` because it's not a variable in the loop head. Also, we don't need to adjust the value of `s` because it's not a variable that changes in the loop head.
