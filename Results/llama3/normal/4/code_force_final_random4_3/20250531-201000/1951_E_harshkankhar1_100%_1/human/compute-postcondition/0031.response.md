Based on the initial state, let's break down the variables and objects involved in the print statement:

* `s`: a string of lowercase Latin characters
* `n`: the length of `s`
* `i`: equal to `n`
* `x`: the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to the first character of `s`
* `func_1(s[0:])`: returns True
* `func_1(s[x + 1:])`: returns False

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])`

The print statement consists of two parts:

1. `s[:x + 1]`: This will print the substring of `s` from the beginning to the index `x` (inclusive). Since `x` is the index of the first character that is not equal to the first character of `s`, this substring will contain all characters that are equal to the first character of `s`.
2. `s[x + 1:]`: This will print the substring of `s` from the index `x + 1` to the end of the string. Since `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns False, this substring will contain characters that are not equal to the first character of `s`.

The output will be a string consisting of two parts: the first part contains all characters equal to the first character of `s`, and the second part contains characters that are not equal to the first character of `s`. The two parts are separated by a space.

Output: **[substring of s containing all characters equal to the first character of s] [substring of s containing characters not equal to the first character of s]**
