The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 3, `func_1(s[0:])` returns True, `i` is 3, `x` is 2**
