Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` checks if a given string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse. This function is used in `func_2` to check if a substring is a palindrome.

`func_2` is the main function that takes a string as input and attempts to partition it into non-palindromic substrings. It first checks if the entire string is not a palindrome, in which case it prints "YES" and the string itself as the partition.

If the entire string is a palindrome, it then checks if the first character is different from the rest of the string. If it is, it sets the index `x` to the position of the first different character. If `x` is still -1 after this loop, it means that all characters in the string are the same, and therefore, there is no valid partition, so it prints "NO".

If `x` is not -1, it then checks if the substring from `x+1` to the end of the string is not a palindrome. If it is not, it prints "YES" and the partition into two substrings: the substring from the start to `x+1` and the substring from `x+1` to the end.

If the substring from `x+1` to the end is a palindrome, it then checks if `x` is 1 or `n//2` (where `n` is the length of the string). If it is, it prints "NO" because there is no valid partition.

If `x` is not 1 or `n//2`, it then prints "YES" and the partition into two substrings: the substring from the start to `x+2` and the substring from `x+2` to the end.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
