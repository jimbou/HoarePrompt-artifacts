Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. 

func_1 is a helper function that checks if a given string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse. 

func_2 is the main function that takes a string as input and checks if it can be partitioned into substrings that are not palindromes. It first checks if the entire string is not a palindrome, in which case it prints 'YES', 1, and the string itself. If the entire string is a palindrome, it then checks if the string can be divided into two substrings, each containing the same character repeated, or two substrings where the first substring contains the same character repeated and the second substring contains a different character repeated. If such a division is possible, it prints 'YES', 2, and the two substrings. If no such division is possible, it prints 'NO'.

However, the program does not fully meet the problem description. The problem requires partitioning the string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome, but the program only checks for divisions into two substrings. It does not consider the case where the string needs to be divided into more than two substrings. 

For example, the string 'ababa' cannot be divided into two substrings that are not palindromes, but it can be divided into three substrings 'a', 'bab', and 'a', where 'bab' is not a palindrome. The program would incorrectly print 'NO' for this input.

Therefore, the program is not fully correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
