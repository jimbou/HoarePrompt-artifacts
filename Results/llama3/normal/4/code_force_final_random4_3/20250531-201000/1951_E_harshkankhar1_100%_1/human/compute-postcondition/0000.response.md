The first line assigns a new string value to `s` from the input. The second line assigns the length of the new string `s` to `n` and assigns -1 to `x`. Since `s` is now a new string, its length is the number of characters in the input string. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of s, x is -1**
