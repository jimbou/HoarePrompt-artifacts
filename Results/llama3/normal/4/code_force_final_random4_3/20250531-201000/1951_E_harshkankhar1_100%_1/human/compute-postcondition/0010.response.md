According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, s is a string of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of s, x is -1, and the function func_1(s[0:]) returns True does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 and i is now 1. 
State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of s and must be greater than 1, x is -1, func_1(s[0:]) returns True, i is 1**
