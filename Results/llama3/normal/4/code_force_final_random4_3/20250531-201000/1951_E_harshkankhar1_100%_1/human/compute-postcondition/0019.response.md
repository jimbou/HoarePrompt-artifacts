Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 3, `func_1(s[0:])` returns True. If the character at index `i` (which is 3) is not equal to the first character of `s`, then `x` is updated to 3. Otherwise, no changes are made to `x` and it remains 2.***
