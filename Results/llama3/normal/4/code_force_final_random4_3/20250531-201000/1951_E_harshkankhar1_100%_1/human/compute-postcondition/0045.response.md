Postcondition: ***s is a string of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of s, func_1(s[0:]) returns True, i is n, and x is the index of the first character in s that is not equal to the first character of s. If func_1(s[x + 1:]) is False, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the substring of s from the start to the index x+1 (inclusive) which is a string of the same character repeated, and the substring of s from the index x+1 to the end which is a string of lowercase Latin characters. If func_1(s[x + 1:]) is True, then if x is either 1 or half of the length of s, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the first x + 2 characters of the string s and the rest of the string s from index x + 2 to the end of the string s are printed.***
