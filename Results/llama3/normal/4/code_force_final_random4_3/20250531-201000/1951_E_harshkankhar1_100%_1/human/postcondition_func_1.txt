This function determines whether a given string of lowercase Latin characters can be divided into two substrings, each containing the same character repeated, or two substrings where the first substring contains the same character repeated and the second substring contains a different character repeated. If the string can be divided in such a way, it prints 'YES', the number 2, and the two substrings. If the string cannot be divided in such a way, it prints 'NO'. If the entire string contains the same character repeated, it prints 'YES', the number 1, and the string itself.
