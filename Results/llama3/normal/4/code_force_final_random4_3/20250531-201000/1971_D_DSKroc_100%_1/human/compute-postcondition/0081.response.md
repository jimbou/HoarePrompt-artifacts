Postcondition: **t is greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains t-4 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), i is equal to the length of s minus 1, count is equal to the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' in s. If a '0' is not followed by a '1' in s, the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' in s plus one is printed, which is equal to count + 1. If a '0' is followed by a '1' in s, the count of times a '0' is followed by a '1' in s which is equal to count is being printed.**
