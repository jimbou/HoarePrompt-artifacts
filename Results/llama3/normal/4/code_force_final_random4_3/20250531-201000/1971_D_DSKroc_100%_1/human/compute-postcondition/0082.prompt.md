Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains t strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive).
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    s = input()
    count = 0
    flag = 0
    for i in range(len(s) - 1):
        if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
            count += 1
        if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
            flag = 1
    if flag == 0:
        print(count + 1)
    else:
        print(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), i is equal to the length of s minus 1. If there is no '0' in s that is followed by a '1', the value of count + 1 is being printed. Otherwise, the number of times the characters in s change from '0' to '1' or from '1' to '0' which is count is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is equal to the length of `s` minus 1, `count` is the number of times the value of `s[i]` is not equal to the value of `s[i + 1]` for all `i` in the range from 0 to the length of `s` minus 2. If there does not exist an `i` in the range from 0 to the length of `s` minus 2 such that the value of `s[i]` is less than the value of `s[i + 1]`, then the number of times the value of `s[i]` is not equal to the value of `s[i + 1]` for all `i` in the range from 0 to the length of `s` minus 2 plus 1 is being printed. Otherwise, the number of times the value of `s[i]` is not equal to the value of `s[i + 1]` for all `i` in the range from 0 to the length of `s` minus 2 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains t-4 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), i is equal to the length of s minus 1, count is equal to the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' in s. If a '0' is not followed by a '1' in s, the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' in s plus one is printed, which is equal to count + 1. If a '0' is followed by a '1' in s, the count of times a '0' is followed by a '1' in s which is equal to count is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
