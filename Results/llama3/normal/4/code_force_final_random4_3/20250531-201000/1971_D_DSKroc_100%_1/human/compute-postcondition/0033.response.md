Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 2, `i` is at least 1, `flag` is 0. If the current value of `s[i]` is different from the current value of `s[i + 1]`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.***
