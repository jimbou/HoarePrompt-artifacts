Functionality: **The function reads a series of binary strings from standard input, where each string consists of characters '0' and '1' with a length between 1 and 500 (inclusive). For each string, it counts the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' and prints this count. If a string does not contain a '0' followed by a '1', it prints the count plus one. The function processes all input strings and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.**
