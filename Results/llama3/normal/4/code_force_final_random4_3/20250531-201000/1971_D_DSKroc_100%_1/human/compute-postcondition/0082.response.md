Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, q is equal to t, stdin is empty, s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), i is equal to the length of s minus 1, count is equal to the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' in s. If a '0' is not followed by a '1' in s, the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' in s plus one is printed, which is equal to count + 1. If a '0' is followed by a '1' in s, the count of times a '0' is followed by a '1' in s which is equal to count is being printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be greater than or equal to 0, `q` will be equal to `t`, the standard input (`stdin`) will be empty, and `s` will be the last string that was processed. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of `s` minus 1, and `count` will be equal to the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' in `s`. If a '0' is not followed by a '1' in `s`, the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' in `s` plus one will be printed, which is equal to `count + 1`. If a '0' is followed by a '1' in `s`, the count of times a '0' is followed by a '1' in `s` which is equal to `count` will be printed.
