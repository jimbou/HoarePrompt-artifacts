Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `q` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 2. If the character at index `i` of `s` is less than the character at index `i+1`, then `flag` is 1, `i` is unknown, and `count` is unknown. Otherwise, `i` is 1, `count` is 2, and `flag` is 1.***
