State: **`t` is greater than 2, `q` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is equal to the length of `s` minus 1, `count` is the number of times the value of `s[i]` is not equal to the value of `s[i + 1]` for all `i` in the range from 0 to the length of `s` minus 2. If there does not exist an `i` in the range from 0 to the length of `s` minus 2 such that the value of `s[i]` is less than the value of `s[i + 1]`, then the number of times the value of `s[i]` is not equal to the value of `s[i + 1]` for all `i` in the range from 0 to the length of `s` minus 2 plus 1 is being printed. Otherwise, the number of times the value of `s[i]` is not equal to the value of `s[i + 1]` for all `i` in the range from 0 to the length of `s` minus 2 is being printed.**
