Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 3, `i` is at least 2. If the current value of `s[i]` is less than the current value of `s[i + 1]`, then `flag` is 1 and `count` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, the values of `flag` and `count` remain unchanged.***
