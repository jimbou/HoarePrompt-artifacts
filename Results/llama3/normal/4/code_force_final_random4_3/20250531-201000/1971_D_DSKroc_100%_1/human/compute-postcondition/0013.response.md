Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 3, `i` is 1, `flag` is 1, `count` is either 0 or 1 or 2. If the current value of `s[i]` is different from the current value of `s[i + 1]`, then `count` is either 1 or 2, and either `count` is 2 and the current value of `s[i]` is different from the current value of `s[i + 1]`, or `count` is 1 and the current value of `s[i]` is the same as the current value of `s[i + 1]`. If the current value of `s[i]` is the same as the current value of `s[i + 1]`, then `count` is either 0 or 1, and either `count` is 1 and the current value of `s[i]` is different from the current value of `s[i + 1]`, or `count` is 0 and the current value of `s[i]` is the same as the current value of `s[i + 1]`. Additionally, if the current value of `s[i]` is less than the current value of `s[i + 1]`, then `flag` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `flag` is set to 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `count` is still dependent on the values of `s[i]` and `s[i+1]`.
