Postcondition: **t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), i is equal to the length of s minus 1. If there is no '0' in s that is followed by a '1', the value of count + 1 is being printed. Otherwise, the number of times the characters in s change from '0' to '1' or from '1' to '0' which is count is being printed.**
