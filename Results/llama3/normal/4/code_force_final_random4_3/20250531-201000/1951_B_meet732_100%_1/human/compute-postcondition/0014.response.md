Output State: **a is a list containing two integers n and k, followed by a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, n is greater than i, x is the kth element of list a, i is increased by 1, ind is a list containing the value of i, c is increased by 1**

The code block modifies the initial state by appending the value of `i` to the list `ind` and incrementing the value of `c` by 1. The value of `i` is increased by 1, and the list `ind` now contains the value of `i`. The value of `c` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
