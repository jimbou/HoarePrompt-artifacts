Postcondition: **`a` is a list containing two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `n` is greater than `i`, `x` is the `k`th element of list `a`, `i` is increased by 1. If `c` is equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i]` is greater than `x`, then `ind` is a list containing the value of `i` and `c` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ind` and `c`. If `c` is not equal to 2, no changes are made to `ind` and `c`.**
