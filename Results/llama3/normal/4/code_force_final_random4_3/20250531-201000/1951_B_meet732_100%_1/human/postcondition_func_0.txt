This function determines the maximum possible distance between the kth element and the elements greater than it in a list of Cowdeforces ratings. It takes a list 'a' containing two integers 'n' and 'k', followed by 'n' distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The function returns the maximum possible distance, considering different cases such as when there are no elements greater than the kth element, when there is only one element greater than the kth element, and when there are multiple elements greater than the kth element. The function returns the maximum distance as an integer value.
