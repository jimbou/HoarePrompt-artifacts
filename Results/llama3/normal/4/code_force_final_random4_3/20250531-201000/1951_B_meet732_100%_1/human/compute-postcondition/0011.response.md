Output State: **`a` is a list containing two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `n` is greater than `i`, `x` is the `k`th element of list `a`, `i` is increased by 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i]` is greater than `x`, then `ind` is a list containing the value of `i` and `c` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ind` and `c`.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `a`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and the relationship between `n` and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `i` is still increased by 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `ind` and `c` depend on the comparison between `a[i]` and `x`. If `a[i]` is greater than `x`, then `ind` contains the value of `i` and `c` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ind` and `c` remain unchanged.
