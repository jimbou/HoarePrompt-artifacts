Postcondition: ***`a` is a list containing two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is the `k`th element of list `a`. If `c` is 2, then `ind` is a list containing the integer `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
