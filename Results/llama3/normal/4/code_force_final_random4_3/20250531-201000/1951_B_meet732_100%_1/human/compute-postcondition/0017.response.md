Postcondition: ***a is a list containing two integers n and k, followed by a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, n is greater than i, x is the kth element of list a, i is increased by 1. If the ith element of list a is greater than x, then ind is a list containing the value of i and c is increased by 1. If c is equal to 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
