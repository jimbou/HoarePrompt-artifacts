Output State: **`a` is a list containing two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is the `k`th element of list `a`, `c` is 2, `ind` is a list containing the integer `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `a`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `ind` remain unchanged. The value of `c` is still 2. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
