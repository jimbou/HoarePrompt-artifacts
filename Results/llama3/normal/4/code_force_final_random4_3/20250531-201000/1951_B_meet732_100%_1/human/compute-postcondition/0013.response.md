The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1 and `n` is greater than `i`. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i`.
State: **`a` is a list containing two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `n` is greater than `i`, `x` is the `k`th element of list `a`, `i` is increased by 1**
