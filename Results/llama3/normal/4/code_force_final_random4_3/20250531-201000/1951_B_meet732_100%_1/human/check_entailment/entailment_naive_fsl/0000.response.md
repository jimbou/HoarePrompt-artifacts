Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the input list `l` contains duplicate elements. The function `func_1` uses the index `k` to access the element `x` in the list `a`, but it does not handle the case where `x` appears multiple times in the list. This can lead to incorrect results when calculating the number of wins for the cow.

For example, if the input list is `[12, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3, 12]` and `k` is 1, the function will incorrectly calculate the number of wins for the cow. The correct output should be 1, but the program will output a different value.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to handle duplicate elements in the input list. One possible solution is to use a different data structure, such as a dictionary, to store the elements and their indices, and then use this data structure to calculate the number of wins for the cow.
