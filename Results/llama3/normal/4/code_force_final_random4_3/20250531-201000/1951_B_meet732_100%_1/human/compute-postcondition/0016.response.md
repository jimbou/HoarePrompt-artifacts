Output State: **`a` is a list containing two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `n` is greater than `i`, `x` is the `k`th element of list `a`, `i` is increased by 1, if the `i`th element of list `a` is greater than `x`, then `ind` is a list containing the value of `i` and `c` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `a`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `i`, `ind`, and `c` remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The list `a` still contains two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The value of `n` is still greater than `i`, and `x` is still the `k`th element of list `a`. The value of `i` is still increased by 1, and if the `i`th element of list `a` is greater than `x`, then `ind` is still a list containing the value of `i` and `c` is still increased by 1.
