Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list containing two integers n and k, followed by a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, x is the kth element of list a, ind is an empty list, c is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] > x:
        ind.append(i)
        c += 1
    if c == 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list containing two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is the `k`th element of list `a`. If `c` is 2, then `ind` is a list containing the integer `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list containing two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `n` is greater than `i`, `x` is the `k`th element of list `a`, `i` is increased by 1. If `c` is equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i]` is greater than `x`, then `ind` is a list containing the value of `i` and `c` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ind` and `c`. If `c` is not equal to 2, no changes are made to `ind` and `c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *a is a list containing two integers n and k, followed by a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, n is greater than i, x is the kth element of list a, i is increased by 1. If the ith element of list a is greater than x, then ind is a list containing the value of i and c is increased by 1. If c is equal to 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
