Postcondition: **a is a list containing two integers n and k, followed by a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, n is greater than 0, x is the kth element of list a, if the current value of a[i] is greater than x, then ind is a list containing the integer i, c is 1, and i is 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
