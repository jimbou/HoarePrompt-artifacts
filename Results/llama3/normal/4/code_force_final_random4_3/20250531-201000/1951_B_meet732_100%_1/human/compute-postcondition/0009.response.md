Output State: **a is a list containing two integers n and k, followed by a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, n is greater than i, x is the kth element of list a, i is increased by 1, ind is a list containing the value of i, c is increased by 1**

In this output state, the list `a` remains unchanged, containing two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The value of `n` is still greater than `i`. The value of `x` is still the `k`th element of list `a`. The value of `i` has been increased by 1. The list `ind` now contains the value of `i`. The value of `c` has been increased by 1.
