Postcondition: **a is a list containing two integers n and k, followed by a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, n is greater than 0, x is the kth element of list a. The current value of c is 2. If the current value of a[i] is greater than x, then the current value of ind is a list containing the integer i, and the current value of c is 1, and the current value of i is 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
