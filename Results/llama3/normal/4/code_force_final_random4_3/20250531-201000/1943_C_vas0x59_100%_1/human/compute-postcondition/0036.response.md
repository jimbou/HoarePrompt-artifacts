Output State: `n` is -1, `_` is -2, `u2vs` is a list of n lists where each list contains all the vertices connected to the vertex at that index, `d` is a dictionary containing the distance of each vertex from the source vertex, `a` is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, `previous` is a dictionary containing the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to each vertex, `b` is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex a, `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices b and all the vertices in the shortest path from the source vertex to vertex b, `ops` is a list containing the tuples (c, 0), (c, 1), ..., (c, ci), `ci` is the integer half of the length of path_ba, `c` is the vertex at index ci in path_ba, `i` is ci.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `ops` contains tuples of the vertex `c` and all indices from 0 to `ci` (inclusive), where `ci` is the integer half of the length of the shortest path from the source vertex to vertex `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
