Output State: **n is at least 3, _ is 2, u2vs is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, and both lists also contain the new values u and v respectively, u is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, v is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, stdin contains no input**

The code first reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to u and v. Since stdin contains no input, this operation does not affect the state of stdin. The values of u and v are then decremented by 1. The lists at indices u and v in u2vs are then appended with the values of v and u respectively. The value of n and the variable _ remain unchanged.
