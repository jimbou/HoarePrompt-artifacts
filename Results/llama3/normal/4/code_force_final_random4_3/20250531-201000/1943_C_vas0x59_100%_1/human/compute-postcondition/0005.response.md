The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1, so `_` is 2, and `n` must be at least 3.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, and both lists also contain the new values u and v respectively, `stdin` contains no input**
