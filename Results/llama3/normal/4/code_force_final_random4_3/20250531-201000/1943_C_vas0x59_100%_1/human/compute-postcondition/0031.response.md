Output State: **`n` is -1, `_` is -2, `u2vs` is a list of n lists where each list contains all the vertices connected to the vertex at that index, `d` is a dictionary containing the distance of each vertex from the source vertex, `a` is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, `previous` is a dictionary containing the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to each vertex, `b` is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex a, `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices b and all the vertices in the shortest path from the source vertex to vertex b, `ops` is a list containing the tuple (c, 0), `ci` is greater than or equal to 0, `c` is the vertex at index ci in path_ba, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the code has appended a tuple containing the vertex `c` and the value `0` to the `ops` list. The other variables remain unchanged. The `ops` list now contains a single tuple, `(c, 0)`, where `c` is the vertex at index `ci` in the `path_ba` list. The values of the other variables are the same as in the initial state.
