Output State: **n is -1, _ is -2, u2vs is a list of n lists where each list contains all the vertices connected to the vertex at that index, d is a dictionary containing the distance of each vertex from the source vertex, a is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, previous is a dictionary containing the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to each vertex, b is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex a, path_ba is a list containing the vertices b and all the vertices in the shortest path from the source vertex to vertex b and must have at least ci2 + 2 elements, ops is a list containing the tuples (c1, 1), (c2, 1), (c1, 3), and (c2, 3), ci2 is half the length of path_ba, ci1 is ci2 minus 1, c1 is the vertex at index ci1 in path_ba, c2 is the vertex at index ci2 in path_ba, i is 3**

The code adds two new tuples to the `ops` list: `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`. Since `i` is 3, these tuples are `(c1, 3)` and `(c2, 3)`. The `ops` list now contains a total of four tuples: `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, and `(c2, 3)`. No other variables are affected by the code.
