#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads the number of vertices in a graph and the edges between them from standard input, constructs the graph, and then performs a series of operations to find the shortest path between the source vertex and the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex. It then constructs a list of tuples containing vertices and indices based on the length of the shortest path, and prints the length of this list and the tuples themselves. The function returns None.
