Output State: **n is an integer, u2vs is a list of n empty lists, stdin contains 1 less input: an integer**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. So now stdin only contains one less input. The second line creates a list of `n` empty lists and assigns it to `u2vs`. No other variables are affected.
