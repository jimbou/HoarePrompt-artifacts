Output State: **`n` is -1, `_` is -2, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains all the vertices connected to the vertex at that index, `d` is a dictionary containing the distance of each vertex from the source vertex, `a` is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, `previous` is a dictionary containing the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to each vertex, `b` is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex `a`, `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices `b` and all the vertices in the shortest path from the source vertex to vertex `b`, `ops` is an empty list.**

In natural language, the output state after the code executes is that a new empty list `ops` has been created. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code. The loop has not executed any iterations, and the shortest path from the source vertex to vertex `b` remains unchanged.
