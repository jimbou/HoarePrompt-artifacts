Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is -1, _ is -2, u2vs is a list of n lists where each list contains all the vertices connected to the vertex at that index, d is a dictionary containing the distance of each vertex from the source vertex, a is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, previous is a dictionary containing the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to each vertex, b is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex a, path_ba is a list containing the vertices b and all the vertices in the shortest path from the source vertex to vertex b, ops is an empty list, ci2 is half the length of path_ba, ci1 is ci2 minus 1, c1 is the vertex at index ci1 in path_ba, c2 is the vertex at index ci2 in path_ba.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - ci1, 2):
    ops.append((c1, i))
    ops.append((c2, i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is -1, _ is -2, u2vs is a list of n lists where each list contains all the vertices connected to the vertex at that index, d is a dictionary containing the distance of each vertex from the source vertex, a is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, previous is a dictionary containing the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to each vertex, b is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex a, path_ba is a list containing the vertices b and all the vertices in the shortest path from the source vertex to vertex b and must have at least ci1 + 2 elements, ops is a list containing the tuples (c1, 1) and (c2, 1), ci2 is half the length of path_ba, ci1 is ci2 minus 1, c1 is the vertex at index ci1 in path_ba, c2 is the vertex at index ci2 in path_ba, i is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is -1, _ is -2, u2vs is a list of n lists where each list contains all the vertices connected to the vertex at that index, d is a dictionary containing the distance of each vertex from the source vertex, a is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, previous is a dictionary containing the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to each vertex, b is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex a, path_ba is a list containing the vertices b and all the vertices in the shortest path from the source vertex to vertex b and must have at least ci2 + 2 elements, ops is a list containing the tuples (c1, 1), (c2, 1), (c1, 3), and (c2, 3), ci2 is half the length of path_ba, ci1 is ci2 minus 1, c1 is the vertex at index ci1 in path_ba, c2 is the vertex at index ci2 in path_ba, i is 3

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is -1, _ is -2, u2vs is a list of n lists where each list contains all the vertices connected to the vertex at that index, d is a dictionary containing the distance of each vertex from the source vertex, a is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, previous is a dictionary containing the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to each vertex, b is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex a, path_ba is a list containing the vertices b and all the vertices in the shortest path from the source vertex to vertex b and must have at least ci2 + 4 elements, ops is a list containing the tuples (c1, 1), (c2, 1), (c1, 3), (c2, 3), (c1, 5), and (c2, 5), ci2 is half the length of path_ba, ci1 is ci2 - 1, c1 is the vertex at index ci1 in path_ba, c2 is the vertex at index ci2 in path_ba, i is 5




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
