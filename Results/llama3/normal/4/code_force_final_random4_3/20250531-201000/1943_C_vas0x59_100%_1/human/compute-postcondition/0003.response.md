The only variables in the loop head are variables  _ and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables _ and n. If _ is less than n - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, n is at least 2. For the loop to execute again _ is increased by 1 so _ is 1 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 2.
State: **n is at least 3, _ is 1, u2vs is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, stdin contains no input**
