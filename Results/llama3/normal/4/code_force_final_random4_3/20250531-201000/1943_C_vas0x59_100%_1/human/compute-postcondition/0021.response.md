Output State: **`n` is the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to vertex `path_ba[-1]`, `_` is `n - 1`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains all the vertices connected to the vertex at that index, `d` is a dictionary containing the distance of each vertex from the source vertex, `a` is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, `previous` is a dictionary containing the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to each vertex, `b` is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex `a`, `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices `b` and `n` and the previous vertex `n` in the shortest path from the source vertex to vertex `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to be the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to vertex `path_ba[-1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `_` is still `n - 1`, and the rest of the variables maintain their original values and properties.
