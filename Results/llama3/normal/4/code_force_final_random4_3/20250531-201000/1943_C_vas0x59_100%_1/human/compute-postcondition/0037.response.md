Output State: **`n` is -1, `_` is -2, `u2vs` is a list of n lists where each list contains all the vertices connected to the vertex at that index, `d` is a dictionary containing the distance of each vertex from the source vertex, `a` is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, `previous` is a dictionary containing the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to each vertex, `b` is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex a, `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices b and all the vertices in the shortest path from the source vertex to vertex b, `ops` is a list containing the tuples (c, 0), (c, 1), (c, 2), ..., (c, ci), `ci` is the integer half of the length of path_ba, `c` is the vertex at index ci in path_ba, `i` is ci.**

The loop executes until `i` reaches `ci`, which is the integer half of the length of `path_ba`. After the loop finishes, `ops` will contain tuples of `(c, i)` for all values of `i` from 0 to `ci`, inclusive. The values of `n`, `_`, `u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`, and `path_ba` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
