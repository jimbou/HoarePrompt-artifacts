The code prints the length of the list `ops`. The list `ops` is constructed based on the length of the list `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains tuples of the form (c, i) where c is the vertex at index i in `path_ba` and i ranges from 0 to half the length of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains tuples of the form (c1, i) and (c2, i) where c1 is the vertex at index ci1 in `path_ba`, c2 is the vertex at index ci2 in `path_ba`, and i ranges from 1 to half the length of `path_ba` in steps of 2.

Since the exact length of `path_ba` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `len(ops)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the length of the list `ops`.

Output: **the length of ops (where ops is the list of tuples constructed based on the length of path_ba)**
