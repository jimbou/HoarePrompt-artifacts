Output State: **`n` is -1, `_` is -2, `u2vs` is a list of n lists where each list contains all the vertices connected to the vertex at that index, `d` is a dictionary containing the distance of each vertex from the source vertex, `a` is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, `previous` is a dictionary containing the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to each vertex, `b` is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex a, `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices b and all the vertices in the shortest path from the source vertex to vertex b, `ops` is a list containing the tuples (c, 0) and (c, 1), `ci` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is the vertex at index ci in path_ba, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the list `ops` has been updated to include the tuple `(c, 1)` in addition to the existing tuple `(c, 0)`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
