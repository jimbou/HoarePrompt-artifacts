Output: **`n` is -1, `_` is -2, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains all the vertices connected to the vertex at that index, `d` is a dictionary containing the distance of each vertex from the source vertex, `a` is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, `previous` is a dictionary containing the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to each vertex, `b` is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex `a`, `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices `b` and all the vertices in the shortest path from the source vertex to vertex `b`. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list containing the tuples (c, 0), (c, 1), (c, 2), ..., (c, ci), where `ci` is the integer half of the length of `path_ba`, `c` is the vertex at index `ci` in `path_ba`, and `i` is `ci`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list containing tuples of the form (c1, i) and (c2, i) where `i` ranges from 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1` in steps of 2, `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `ci1` is `ci2` minus 1, `c1` is the vertex at index `ci1` in `path_ba`, `c2` is the vertex at index `ci2` in `path_ba`, and `i` is `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`, and the following is printed:**

*   If the length of `path_ba` is odd, the following is printed: `c + 1` and `i` for each tuple (c, i) in `ops`, where `c` is the vertex at index `ci` in `path_ba`, and `i` is `ci`. 
*   If the length of `path_ba` is even, the following is printed: `c1 + 1` and `i`, and `c2 + 1` and `i` for each tuple (c1, i) and (c2, i) in `ops`, where `c1` is the vertex at index `ci1` in `path_ba`, `c2` is the vertex at index `ci2` in `path_ba`, and `i` is `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`.
