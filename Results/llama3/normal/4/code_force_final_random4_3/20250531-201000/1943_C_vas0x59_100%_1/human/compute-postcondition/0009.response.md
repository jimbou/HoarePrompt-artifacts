Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state.

State: **n is an integer, _ is n - 1, u2vs is a list of n lists where each list contains all the vertices connected to the vertex at that index, d is a dictionary containing the distance of each vertex from the source vertex, a is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, previous is a dictionary containing the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to each vertex, b is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex a, path_ba is a list containing the vertex b**
