Output State: **`n` is the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to vertex `path_ba[-1]`, `_` is `n - 1`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains all the vertices connected to the vertex at that index, `d` is a dictionary containing the distance of each vertex from the source vertex, `a` is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, `previous` is a dictionary containing the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to each vertex, `b` is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex `a`, `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices `b` and `n`. If `n` is -1, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the function continues with the current values of `n`, `_`, `u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`, and `path_ba`.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `path_ba` now contains an additional vertex `n`, which is the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to vertex `path_ba[-1]`. The values of the other variables remain the same. If `n` is -1, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise, it continues with the current values.
