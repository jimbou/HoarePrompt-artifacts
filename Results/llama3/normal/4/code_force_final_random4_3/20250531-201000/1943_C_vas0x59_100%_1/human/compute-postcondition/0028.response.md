Postcondition: **`n` is -1, `_` is -2, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains all the vertices connected to the vertex at that index, `d` is a dictionary containing the distance of each vertex from the source vertex, `a` is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, `previous` is a dictionary containing the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to each vertex, `b` is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex `a`, `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices `b` and all the vertices in the shortest path from the source vertex to vertex `b`, `ops` is an empty list. The current length of `path_ba` is an odd number.**
