Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, _ is n - 1, u2vs is a list of n lists where each list contains all the vertices connected to the vertex at that index, d is a dictionary containing the distance of each vertex from the source vertex, a is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, previous is a dictionary containing the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to each vertex, b is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex a, path_ba is a list containing the vertex b.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to vertex `path_ba[-1]`, `_` is `n - 1`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains all the vertices connected to the vertex at that index, `d` is a dictionary containing the distance of each vertex from the source vertex, `a` is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, `previous` is a dictionary containing the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to each vertex, `b` is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex `a`, `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices `b` and `n`. If `n` is -1, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the function continues with the current values of `n`, `_`, `u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`, and `path_ba`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to vertex `b`, `_` is `n - 1`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains all the vertices connected to the vertex at that index, `d` is a dictionary containing the distance of each vertex from the source vertex, `a` is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, `previous` is a dictionary containing the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to each vertex, `b` is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex `a`, `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices `b` and `n` and the previous vertex `n` in the shortest path from the source vertex to vertex `b`. If `n` is -1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to vertex `path_ba[-1]`, `_` is `n - 1`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains all the vertices connected to the vertex at that index, `d` is a dictionary containing the distance of each vertex from the source vertex, `a` is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, `previous` is a dictionary containing the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to each vertex, `b` is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex `a`, `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices `b` and `n` and the previous vertex `n` in the shortest path from the source vertex to vertex `b` and the new value of `n` appended to `path_ba`. If `n` is -1, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the function continues to execute.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
