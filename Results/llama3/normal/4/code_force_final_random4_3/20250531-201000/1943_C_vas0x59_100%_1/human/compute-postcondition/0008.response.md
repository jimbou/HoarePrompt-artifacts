Output State: **n is an integer, _ is n - 1, u2vs is a list of n lists where each list contains all the vertices connected to the vertex at that index, d is a dictionary containing the distance of each vertex from the source vertex, a is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, previous is a dictionary containing the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to each vertex, b is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex a, path_ba is a list containing the vertex b.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `_`, and `u2vs` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The `bfs` function is called twice, first with the source vertex `0` and then with the source vertex `a`. The first call to `bfs` assigns the distance of each vertex from the source vertex `0` to `d`, and the second call assigns the distance of each vertex from the source vertex `a` to `d`. The `func_1` function is called twice, first with the distance dictionary `d` and then with the updated distance dictionary `d`, assigning the vertex with the maximum distance to `a` and then to `b`. The `previous` dictionary is updated to contain the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to each vertex. The `path_ba` list is initialized with the vertex `b`.
