To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, because the range is `n - 1`. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop execution, but it will be assigned a value from the range, starting from 0.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `_` is 0, u2vs is a list of n empty lists, stdin contains 1 less input: an integer**
