Output State: **`n` is the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to vertex `path_ba[-1]`, `_` is `n - 1`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains all the vertices connected to the vertex at that index, `d` is a dictionary containing the distance of each vertex from the source vertex, `a` is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, `previous` is a dictionary containing the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to each vertex, `b` is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex `a`, `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices `b` and `n` and the previous vertex `n` in the shortest path from the source vertex to vertex `b` and the new value of `n` appended to `path_ba`. If `n` is -1, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the function continues to execute.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but with the value of `n` appended to the list `path_ba`. The function continues to execute if `n` is not -1, otherwise, it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
