Output State: **n is -1, _ is -2, u2vs is a list of n lists where each list contains all the vertices connected to the vertex at that index, d is a dictionary containing the distance of each vertex from the source vertex, a is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, previous is a dictionary containing the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to each vertex, b is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex a, path_ba is a list containing the vertices b and all the vertices in the shortest path from the source vertex to vertex b, ops is an empty list, ci2 is half the length of path_ba, ci1 is ci2 minus 1, c1 is the vertex at index ci1 in path_ba, c2 is the vertex at index ci2 in path_ba.**

In this final state, the variables `ci2`, `ci1`, `c1`, and `c2` have been added. The values of `ci2` and `ci1` are calculated based on the length of `path_ba`, which is even. The values of `c1` and `c2` are the vertices at the calculated indices in `path_ba`. The other variables remain unchanged.
