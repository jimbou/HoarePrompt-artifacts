To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `ci`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `ci + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `ci` is greater than or equal to 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `ci` remains the same, but since `i` is now 1, `ci` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is -1, `_` is -2, `u2vs` is a list of n lists where each list contains all the vertices connected to the vertex at that index, `d` is a dictionary containing the distance of each vertex from the source vertex, `a` is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, `previous` is a dictionary containing the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to each vertex, `b` is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex a, `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices b and all the vertices in the shortest path from the source vertex to vertex b, `ops` is a list containing the tuple (c, 0), `ci` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is the vertex at index ci in path_ba, `i` is 1**
