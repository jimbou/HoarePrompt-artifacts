The code prints the elements of the `ops` list, where each element is a tuple containing a vertex and an index. The vertex is incremented by 1 and the index is kept as is. The elements are printed on separate lines.

Since the exact values of the vertices and indices in the `ops` list are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the output. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a vertex (incremented by 1) and an index.

Output: **A list of tuples, where each tuple contains a vertex (incremented by 1) and an index, printed on separate lines**
