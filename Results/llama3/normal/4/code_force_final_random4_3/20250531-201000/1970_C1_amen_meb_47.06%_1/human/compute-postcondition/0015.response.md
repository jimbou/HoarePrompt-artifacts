Postcondition: ***numbers is a list containing two lists with two integers each, num1 is an integer equal to the first string in nums, num2 is an integer equal to the second string in nums, nums is a list containing two strings that are the first two strings of the input, stdin contains n-3 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u_1. If the length of nums is not equal to 2, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the function continues to execute.***
