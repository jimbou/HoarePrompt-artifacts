Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state.

State: **numbers is a list containing one list with two integers, num1 is an integer equal to the first integer in nums, num2 is an integer equal to the second integer in nums, nums is a list containing two integers, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u_1**
