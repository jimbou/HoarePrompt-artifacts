Postcondition: ***`numbers` is an empty list, `nums` is a list containing two integers n and t, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u_1. If `nums` contains exactly two integers, the program continues execution. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
