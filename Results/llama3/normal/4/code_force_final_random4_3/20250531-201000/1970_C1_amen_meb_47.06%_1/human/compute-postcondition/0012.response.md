Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state.

State: **numbers is a list containing two lists with two integers each, num1 is an integer equal to the first string in nums, num2 is an integer equal to the second string in nums, nums is a list containing two strings, stdin contains n-2 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u_1**
