Output State: **numbers is a list containing one list with two integers, num1 is an integer equal to the first integer in the first list in numbers, num2 is an integer equal to the second integer in the first list in numbers, nums is a list containing two strings, stdin contains n-2 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u_1**

In this output state, the values of `numbers`, `num1`, and `num2` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `nums` is updated to a list containing two strings, which are the input from the user. The stdin now contains n-2 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u_1, because one line of input has been consumed by the `input()` function.
