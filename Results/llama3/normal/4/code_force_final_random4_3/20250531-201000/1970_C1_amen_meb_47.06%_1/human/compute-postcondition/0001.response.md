Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once, regardless of the program state. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state.

State: **`numbers` is an empty list, stdin contains three inputs: first two integers n and t (2 <= n <= 2*10^5, t=1), then n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v (1 <= u, v <= n), and finally one integer u_1 (1 <= u_1 <= n)**
