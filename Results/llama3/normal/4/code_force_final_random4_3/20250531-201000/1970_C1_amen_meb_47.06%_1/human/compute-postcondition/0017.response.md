Output State: **numbers is a list containing n-1 lists with two integers each, num1 is an integer equal to the first integer in the last line of stdin, num2 is an integer equal to the second integer in the last line of stdin, nums is a list containing two integers that are the last two integers in stdin, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `numbers` will contain `n-1` sublists, each containing two integers. The variables `num1` and `num2` will hold the values of the first and second integers in the last line of the input, respectively. The list `nums` will contain these two integers as strings. The input stream `stdin` will be empty, as all the input lines will have been processed by the loop.
