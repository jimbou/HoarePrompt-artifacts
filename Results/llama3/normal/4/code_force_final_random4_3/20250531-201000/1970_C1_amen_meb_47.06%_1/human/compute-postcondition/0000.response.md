Output State: **`numbers` is an empty list, stdin contains three inputs: first two integers n and t (2 <= n <= 2*10^5, t=1), then n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v (1 <= u, v <= n), and finally one integer u_1 (1 <= u_1 <= n)**

In natural language, the output state is that a new empty list called `numbers` has been created, and the state of the standard input (stdin) remains unchanged, still containing three inputs: the first two integers `n` and `t` with the given constraints, followed by `n-1` lines of two integers `u` and `v` each, and finally one integer `u_1` within the specified range.
