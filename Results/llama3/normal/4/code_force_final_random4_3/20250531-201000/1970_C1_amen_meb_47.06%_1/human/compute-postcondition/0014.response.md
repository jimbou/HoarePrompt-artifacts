Output State: **numbers is a list containing two lists with two integers each, num1 is an integer equal to the first string in nums, num2 is an integer equal to the second string in nums, nums is a list containing two strings that are the first two strings of the input, stdin contains n-3 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u_1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables numbers, num1, num2, and nums remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains the same input. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
