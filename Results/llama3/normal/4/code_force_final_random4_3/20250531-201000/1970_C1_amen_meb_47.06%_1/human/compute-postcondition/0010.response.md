Postcondition: ***numbers is a list containing one list with two integers, num1 is an integer equal to the first integer in the first list in numbers, num2 is an integer equal to the second integer in the first list in numbers, nums is a list containing two strings, stdin contains n-2 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u_1. If nums contains exactly two strings, then the program continues normally. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
