Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1()` reads the input from stdin, but it does not correctly parse the input. The function is supposed to read the number of nodes `n` and the number of rounds `t`, followed by `n-1` lines of edges, and finally `t` integers representing the starting nodes. However, the function only reads the edges and the last two integers, which are not correctly parsed.

Moreover, the main part of the program does not correctly implement the game logic. The program is supposed to determine the winner of each round based on the starting node, but it does not correctly calculate the distances from the starting node to the leaves of the tree.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
