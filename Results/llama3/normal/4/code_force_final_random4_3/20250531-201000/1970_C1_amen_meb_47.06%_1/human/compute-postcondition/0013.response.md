Output State: **numbers is a list containing two lists with two integers each, num1 is an integer equal to the first string in nums, num2 is an integer equal to the second string in nums, nums is a list containing two strings that are the first two strings of the input, stdin contains n-3 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u_1**

In this output state, the value of nums has been updated to be the first two strings of the input, which are split by the space character. The values of numbers, num1, and num2 remain the same as they were not affected by the code. The stdin now contains n-3 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u_1, as one line of input has been consumed by the input() function.
