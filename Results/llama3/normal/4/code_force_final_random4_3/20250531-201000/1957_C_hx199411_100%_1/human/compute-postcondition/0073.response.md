Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive and is at least `2k + 4`, `k` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `i` is in the range of `3` to `m + 1`, `m` is equal to `n - 2k - 1` and is at least 3, `c` and `r` are integers that were read from the input, `num` is either `2k` or `2k+1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k`, each test case contains 0 lines, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for `i` in the range of `3` to `m + 1`, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that the `dp` list has been updated according to the given formula for `i` in the range of `3` to `m + 1`. The values of `dp[i]` are calculated using the previous values of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`, and the result is taken modulo `10 ** 9 + 7`.
