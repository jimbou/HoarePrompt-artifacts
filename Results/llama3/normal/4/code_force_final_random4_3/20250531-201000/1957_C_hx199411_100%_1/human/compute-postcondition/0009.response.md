Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, num is either 1 or 2, i is 1, c and r are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains k-1 lines, each containing two integers r_i and c_i. If c is equal to r, then num is 1. Otherwise, num is 2.***
