Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `num` is an integer between `k` and 2*`k` inclusive, `i` is equal to `k` if `m` is 0 or 1, otherwise `i` is equal to `m+1`, `m` is an integer between `n - 2k` and `n - k` inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains 0 lines. If `m` is 0 or 1, the number 1 is being printed. Otherwise, a list `dp` of length `m+1` is created with `dp[1] = 1`, `dp[2] = 3`, and for all `i` from 3 to `m+1`, `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, and the `m`th element of the `dp` list, which is `dp[m]`, is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` is 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The values of `n`, `k`, `num`, `i`, and `m` are still within their respective ranges, but their exact values depend on the input provided. If `m` is 0 or 1, the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, a list `dp` is created and populated with values according to the given formula, and the `m`th element of the `dp` list is printed.
