The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to `n` inclusive. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to `n` inclusive, `i` is 3, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains `k-2` lines, each containing two integers `r_i` and `c_i`. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 2. Otherwise, `num` is 3 if `c` is not equal to `r` and was 1, or `num` is 4 if `c` is not equal to `r` and was 2.**
