The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= n) followed by k lines, each containing two integers r_i and c_i**
