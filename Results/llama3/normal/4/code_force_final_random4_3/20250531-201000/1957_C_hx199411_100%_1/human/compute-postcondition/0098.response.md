Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is at least 2 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `m` is equal to `n - 2k` or `n - 2k - 1`, `num` is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, `c` is an integer read from the input, `r` is an integer read from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus k - 1, each test case contains 0 lines. If `m` is 0, the number 1 is being printed. If `m` is 1, the number 1 is printed. If `m` is not 1, `n` is at least 2k + 4, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `m` is equal to `n - 2k - 1` and is at least 3, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for `i` in the range of 3 to `m + 1`, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, and the value of `dp[m]` is being printed, which is `(dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. Additionally, if `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 1 or 2 or 3, otherwise `num` is 2 or 3 or 4 and `c` is not equal to `r`.**

In this output state, the values of `c` and `r` have been updated to the integers read from the input. The rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus k - 1, each test case contains 0 lines.
