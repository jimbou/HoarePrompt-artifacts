The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, the first integer read from stdin is assigned to `t`. The remaining test cases are still in stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= n) followed by k lines, each containing two integers r_i and c_i.**
