Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, `num` is 0, `i` is equal to `k` if `m` is 0 or 1, otherwise `i` is equal to `m+1`, `m` is an integer between `n - 2k` and `n - k` inclusive, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, each test case contains 0 lines**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `i`, and `m` remain the same as in the initial state. The code only updates the values of `c` and `r`, which are now integers assigned from the input. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two, each with 0 lines, since one test case has been read to assign values to `c` and `r`.
