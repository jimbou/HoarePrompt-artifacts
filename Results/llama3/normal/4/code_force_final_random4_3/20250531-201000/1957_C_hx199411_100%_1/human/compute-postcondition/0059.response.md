Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between `i+1` and n inclusive, `i` is equal to `k+1` if `m` is 0 or 1, otherwise `i` is equal to `m+3`, `m` is an integer between `n - 2k` and `n - k` inclusive, `c` and `r` are integers that were read from the input, `num` is 4 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 5, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, each test case contains 0 lines.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to be 4 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise it is 5. All other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus four, each test case containing 0 lines.
