Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer between 0 and n inclusive, i is equal to m+k, m is equal to n - 2k - 1, c and r are integers that were read from the input, num is either 2k or 2k+1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus k, each test case contains 0 lines, dp is a list of m+1 elements initialized with 0, dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3
Code of the loop:
for i in range(3, m + 1):
    dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive and is at least `2k + 4`, `k` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `i` is in the range of `3` to `m + 1`, `m` is equal to `n - 2k - 1` and is at least 3, `c` and `r` are integers that were read from the input, `num` is either `2k` or `2k+1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k`, each test case contains 0 lines, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for `i` in the range of `3` to `m + 1`, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive and is at least `2k + 4`, `k` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `i` is in the range of `4` to `m + 1`, `m` is equal to `n - 2k - 1` and is at least 3, `c` and `r` are integers that were read from the input, `num` is either `2k` or `2k+1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k`, each test case contains 0 lines, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for `i` in the range of `3` to `m + 1`, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, and `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive and is at least `2k + 4`, `k` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `i` is in the range of `5` to `m + 1`, `m` is equal to `n - 2k - 1` and is at least 3, `c` and `r` are integers that were read from the input, `num` is either `2k` or `2k+1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k`, each test case contains 0 lines, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for `i` in the range of `3` to `m + 1`, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, and `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
