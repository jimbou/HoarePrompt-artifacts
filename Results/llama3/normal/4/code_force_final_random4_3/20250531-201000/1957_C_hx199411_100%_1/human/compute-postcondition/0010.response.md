The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer between 1 and n inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 1.
State: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to n inclusive, num is either 1 or 2, i is 2, c and r are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains k-1 lines, each containing two integers r_i and c_i. If c is equal to r, then num is 1. Otherwise, num is 2.**
