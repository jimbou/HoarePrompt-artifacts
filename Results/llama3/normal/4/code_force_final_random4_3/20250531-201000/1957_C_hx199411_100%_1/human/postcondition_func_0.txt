This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing two integers n and k, followed by k lines of two integers each. It calculates the number of ways to arrange the integers in a specific pattern, considering the values of n and k. If the calculated value m is 0 or 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it uses dynamic programming to calculate the mth element of a list dp, which represents the number of ways to arrange the integers, and prints this value. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point it terminates.
