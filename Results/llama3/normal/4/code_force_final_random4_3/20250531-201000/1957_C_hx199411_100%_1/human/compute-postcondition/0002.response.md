Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer between 0 and n inclusive, num is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains k lines, each containing two integers r_i and c_i**

The code first decrements the value of `t` by 1, so `t` is now one less than its original value. The second line reads two integers `n` and `k` from stdin, where `n` is between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, and `k` is between 0 and `n` inclusive. The third line initializes a new variable `num` to 0. The remaining test cases in stdin are reduced by one, and each test case now contains `k` lines, each with two integers `r_i` and `c_i`.
