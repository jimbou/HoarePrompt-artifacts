Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `i` is equal to `k` if `m` is 0 or 1, otherwise `i` is equal to `m+k`, `m` is equal to `n - 2k` or `n - 2k - 1`, `c` and `r` are integers that were read from the input, `num` is either `2k` or `2k+1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `k-1`, each test case contains 0 lines, and `m` is not equal to 0. If `m` is 1, the value 1 is printed. If `m` is not 1, `n` is at least `2k + 4`, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `m` is equal to `n - 2k - 1` and is at least 3, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for `i` in the range of `3` to `m + 1`, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, and the value of `dp[m]` is being printed, which is `(dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`***
