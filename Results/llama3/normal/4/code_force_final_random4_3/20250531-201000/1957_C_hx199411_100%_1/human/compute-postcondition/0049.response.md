Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, `num` is 2, `i` is equal to `k` if `m` is 0 or 1, otherwise `i` is equal to `m+1`, `m` is an integer between `n - 2k` and `n - k` inclusive, `c` and `r` are integers, and `c` is not equal to `r`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, each test case contains 0 lines**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to 2, as it was incremented by 2 in the given code. All other variables remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two, each with 0 lines.
