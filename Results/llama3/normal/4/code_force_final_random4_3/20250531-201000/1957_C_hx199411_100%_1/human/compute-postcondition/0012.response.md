Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to `n` inclusive, `num` is either 2 or 3, `i` is 2, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains `k-2` lines, each containing two integers `r_i` and `c_i`. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 2. Otherwise, `num` is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been incremented by 1. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is now 2. Otherwise, `num` is now 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case containing `k-2` lines, each with two integers `r_i` and `c_i`.
