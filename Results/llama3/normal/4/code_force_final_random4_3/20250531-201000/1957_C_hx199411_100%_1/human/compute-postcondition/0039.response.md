The code prints the value of dp[m] which is the mth element of the dp list.
Since m is an integer between n - 2k and n - k inclusive, and dp is a list of length m+1 with dp[1] = 1, dp[2] = 3, and for all i from 3 to m+1, dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), the value of dp[m] is calculated using the recurrence relation.
Output: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer between 0 and n inclusive, num is an integer between k and 2*k inclusive, i is equal to m+1, m is an integer between n - 2k and n - k inclusive, is not equal to 0 and is not equal to 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains 0 lines, dp is a list of length m+1 with dp[1] = 1, dp[2] = 3, and for all i from 3 to m+1, dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), and the mth element of the dp list which is dp[m] is being printed**
