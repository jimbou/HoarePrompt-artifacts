The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `k` if `m` is 0 or 1, otherwise `i` is equal to `m+1`, `k` is an integer between 1 and n inclusive. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `k` must be greater than `i`. 
State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to `k` if `m` is 0 or 1, otherwise `i` is equal to `m+2`, `m` is an integer between `n - 2k` and `n - k` inclusive, `c` and `r` are integers. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2. stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, each test case contains 0 lines.**
