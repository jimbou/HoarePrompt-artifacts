Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer between 0 and n inclusive, num is 0, i is equal to k if m is 0 or 1, otherwise i is equal to m+1, m is an integer between n - 2k and n - k inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains 0 lines.**

The code snippet modifies the initial state in the following ways:

- The first line decrements `t` by 1, making it one less than its original value. Since `t` was greater than 1, it is now greater than 0.

- The second line reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. Since stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case containing 0 lines, this operation does not change the number of test cases or lines in each test case. The values of `n` and `k` are now integers between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive and between 0 and `n` inclusive, respectively.

- The third line assigns 0 to `num`, making it 0.

The values of `i` and `m` are not modified by the code snippet, so they remain the same as in the initial state.
