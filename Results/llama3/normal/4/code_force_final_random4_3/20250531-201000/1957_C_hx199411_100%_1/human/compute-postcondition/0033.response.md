The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4, and `m` must be greater than 4.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `num` is an integer between `k` and 2*`k` inclusive, `i` is 4, `m` is at least 4 and is an integer between `n` - 2*`k` and `n` - `k` inclusive, is not equal to 0 and is not equal to 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains 0 lines, dp is a list of length `m`+1 with dp[1] = 1, dp[2] = 3, dp[3] = (dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), dp[4] = (dp[3] + (4 - 1) * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)**
