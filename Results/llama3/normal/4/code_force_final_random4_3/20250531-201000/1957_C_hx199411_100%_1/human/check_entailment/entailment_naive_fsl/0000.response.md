Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves.

The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of configurations. It first calculates the number of rows and columns that are not blocked by the k moves and their mirrored moves. Then, it uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of configurations for the remaining rows and columns.

The dynamic programming approach is based on the fact that for each row, there are two possibilities: either a white rook is placed in that row, or a black rook is placed in that row. If a white rook is placed in a row, then the number of configurations for the remaining rows is the same as the number of configurations for the remaining rows without the current row. If a black rook is placed in a row, then the number of configurations for the remaining rows is twice the number of configurations for the remaining rows without the current row, because the black rook can be placed in any of the remaining columns.

The program correctly handles the base cases where there are 0, 1, or 2 remaining rows and columns. It also correctly handles the case where there are more than 2 remaining rows and columns, by using the dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of configurations.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
