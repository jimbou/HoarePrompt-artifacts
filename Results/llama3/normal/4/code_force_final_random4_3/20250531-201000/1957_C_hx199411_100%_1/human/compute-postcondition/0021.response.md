Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `num` is an integer between `k` and 2*`k` inclusive, `i` is equal to `k`, `m` is an integer between `n - 2k` and `n - k` inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains 0 lines.**

In this output state, the value of `m` is calculated by subtracting `num` from `n`. Since `num` is between `k` and 2*`k` inclusive, `m` will be between `n - 2k` and `n - k` inclusive. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case containing 0 lines.
