Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between `i+1` and n inclusive, `i` is equal to `k+1` if `m` is 0 or 1, otherwise `i` is equal to `m+3`, `m` is an integer between `n - 2k` and `n - k` inclusive, `c` and `r` are integers that were read from the input, `num` is either 3 or 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, each test case contains 0 lines.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been incremented by 1. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is now 3, otherwise `num` is now 4. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
