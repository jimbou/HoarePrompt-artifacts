The code prints the value of `dp[m]`, which is the `m`-th element of the `dp` list. The value of `dp[m]` is calculated using the formula `(dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. This formula is based on the previous values of `dp`, specifically `dp[m - 1]` and `dp[m - 2]`.

Since `m` is at least 3, the value of `dp[m]` depends on the values of `dp[m - 1]` and `dp[m - 2]`, which are calculated in the previous iterations of the loop. The loop iterates from `i=3` to `m+1`, and in each iteration, it calculates the value of `dp[i]` based on the previous values of `dp`.

The value of `dp[m]` is a result of the recursive calculation, where each value of `dp` depends on the previous values. The exact value of `dp[m]` cannot be determined without knowing the initial values of `dp[1]` and `dp[2]`, which are 1 and 3, respectively.

However, based on the formula, we can describe the value of `dp[m]` as a function of the previous values of `dp`. Specifically, it is the sum of `dp[m - 1]` and `(m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2`, modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Output: **(dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)**
