Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to arrange the integers in a specific pattern, considering the values of n and k. The program handles the base cases where m is 0 or 1 correctly, and it uses the correct recurrence relation to calculate the mth element of the list dp. The program also correctly handles the modulo operation to prevent overflow.

The execution summary accurately describes the behavior of the program, and it correctly identifies the input and output of the program. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing two integers n and k, followed by k lines of two integers each. It calculates the number of ways to arrange the integers in a specific pattern, considering the values of n and k, and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
