The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is greater than 1 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `num` is an integer between `k` and 2*`k` inclusive, `i` is equal to `k` if `m` is 0 or 1, otherwise `i` is equal to `m+1`, `m` is an integer between `n - 2k` and `n - k` inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains 0 lines.**
