Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is at least `k` less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is equal to its original value, `i` is 6, `m` is at least 6, `num` is either `k`, `k+1`, `k+2`, ..., or `2k`, `c` is an integer read from the input, `r` is an integer read from the input, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is `(dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `dp[4]` is `(dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `dp[5]` is `(dp[4] + 4 * dp[3] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `dp[6]` is `(dp[5] + 5 * dp[4] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, and the value of `dp[m]` is being printed, which is `(dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, and if `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is `k`, `k+1`, ..., or `2k-1`, otherwise `num` is `k+1`, `k+2`, ..., or `2k` and `c` is not equal to `r`. `m` is not equal to 0 and is not equal to 1**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `dp[6]` has been calculated and added to the list `dp`. The value of `dp[6]` is `(dp[5] + 5 * dp[4] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, which is a specific combination of the previous values in the list `dp`. All other variables remain unchanged.
