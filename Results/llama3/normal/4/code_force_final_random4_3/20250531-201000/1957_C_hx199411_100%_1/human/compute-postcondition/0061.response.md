Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer between 0 and n inclusive, i is equal to k if m is 0 or 1, otherwise i is equal to m+k, m is an integer between n - 2k and n - k inclusive, c and r are integers that were read from the input, num is either 2k or 2k+1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus k-1, each test case contains 0 lines.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed k times, where k is an integer between 0 and n inclusive. The value of i has been updated to be equal to k if m is 0 or 1, otherwise it is equal to m+k. The value of num has been updated to be either 2k or 2k+1, depending on whether c equals r or not. The state of the other variables in the precondition remains unchanged.
