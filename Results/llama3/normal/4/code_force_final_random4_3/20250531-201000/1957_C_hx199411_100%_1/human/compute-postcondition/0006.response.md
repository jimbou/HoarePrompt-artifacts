Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, num is 1, i is 1, c and r are integers and c is equal to r, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains k-1 lines, each containing two integers r_i and c_i.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `num` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still greater than 0 and one less than its original value. The value of `n` is still an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, and the value of `k` is still an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive. The value of `i` is still 1. The values of `c` and `r` are still integers, and `c` is still equal to `r`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case containing `k-1` lines, each containing two integers `r_i` and `c_i`.
