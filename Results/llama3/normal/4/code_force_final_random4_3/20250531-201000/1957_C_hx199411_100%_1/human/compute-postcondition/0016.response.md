Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to `n` inclusive, `i` is 3, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is either 2, 3 or 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains `k-3` lines, each containing two integers `r_i` and `c_i`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `c` and `r` are updated to the two integers read from the input. The value of `num` is determined based on the values of `c` and `r`, and can be either 2, 3, or 4. The stdin now contains one less test case, with each test case having `k-3` lines of input instead of `k-2`.
