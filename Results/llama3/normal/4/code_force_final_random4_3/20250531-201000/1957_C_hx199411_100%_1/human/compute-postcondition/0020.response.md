Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer between 0 and n inclusive, num is an integer between k and 2k inclusive, i is equal to k, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains 0 lines.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, `n` is still within its original range, and `k` is now 0 (since the loop has finished executing). The value of `num` is now between `k` and `2k` inclusive, indicating that it has been incremented by either 1 or 2 in each iteration of the loop. The value of `i` is now equal to `k`, indicating that the loop has executed `k` times. Finally, the input stream `stdin` now contains one less test case, and each test case contains 0 lines, indicating that all input has been processed.
