To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `k`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, `num` is 0, `i` is equal to `k` if `m` is 0 or 1, otherwise `i` is equal to `m+1`, `m` is an integer between `n - 2k` and `n - k` inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains 0 lines**
