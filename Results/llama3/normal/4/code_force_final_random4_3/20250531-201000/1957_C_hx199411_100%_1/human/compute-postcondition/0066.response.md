Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `i` is equal to `k` if `m` is 0 or 1, otherwise `i` is equal to `m+k`, `m` is equal to `n - 2k` or `n - 2k - 1`, `c` and `r` are integers that were read from the input, `num` is either `2k` or `2k+1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `k-1`, each test case contains 0 lines, and `m` is not equal to 0***
