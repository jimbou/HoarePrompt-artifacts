To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `m`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `m + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is in the range of `4` to `m + 1`, and `m` is at least 3.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now in the range of `5` to `m + 1`. The value of `m` remains the same.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive and is at least `2k + 4`, `k` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `i` is in the range of `5` to `m + 1`, `m` is equal to `n - 2k - 1` and is at least 3, `c` and `r` are integers that were read from the input, `num` is either `2k` or `2k+1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k`, each test case contains 0 lines, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for `i` in the range of `3` to `m + 1`, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, and `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)**
