Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to `k` if `m` is 0 or 1, otherwise `i` is equal to `m+2`, `m` is an integer between `n - 2k` and `n - k` inclusive, `c` and `r` are integers that were read from the input, `num` is 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, each test case contains 0 lines.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `m` remain the same as in the initial state. The values of `c` and `r` are updated to the integers read from the input. The value of `num` is determined based on whether `c` equals `r`. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus three, each test case containing 0 lines.
