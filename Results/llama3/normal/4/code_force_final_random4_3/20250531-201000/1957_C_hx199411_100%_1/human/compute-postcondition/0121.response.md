Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and is at least `k` less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is equal to its original value, `i` is `m+1`, `m` is at least 3, `num` is either `k`, `k+1`, `k+2`, ..., or `2k`, `c` is an integer read from the input, `r` is an integer read from the input, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for `i` in the range of 3 to `m + 1`, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, and the value of `dp[m]` is being printed, which is `(dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, and if `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is `k`, `k+1`, ..., or `2k-1`, otherwise `num` is `k+1`, `k+2`, ..., or `2k` and `c` is not equal to `r`. `m` is not equal to 0 and is not equal to 1.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the values of `i` and `dp`. The loop iterates from `i=3` to `m+1`, and in each iteration, it calculates the value of `dp[i]` based on the previous values of `dp`. After the loop finishes, `i` is equal to `m+1`, and `dp` contains the calculated values for all indices from 1 to `m+1`. The other variables, such as `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `c`, and `r`, remain unchanged.
