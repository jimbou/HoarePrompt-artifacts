Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between `i+1` and n inclusive, `i` is equal to `k+1` if `m` is 0 or 1, otherwise `i` is equal to `m+3`, `m` is an integer between `n - 2k` and `n - k` inclusive, `c` and `r` are integers that were read from the input, if `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 2, otherwise `num` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, each test case contains 0 lines.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `m`, and `num` remain the same as in the initial state. However, the values of `c` and `r` have been updated to the integers read from the input. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus four, each test case containing 0 lines, since one test case has been read.
