Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0 and is at least k less than its original value, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, k is equal to its original value, i is equal to k-1, m is equal to n - num, num is either k, k+1, k+2, ..., or 2k, c is an integer read from the input, r is an integer read from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus k, each test case contains 0 lines. If m is not 1, n is at least 2k + 4, i is equal to m + 1, m is equal to n - num - 1 and is at least 3, dp is a list of m+1 elements where dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, and for i in the range of 3 to m + 1, dp[i] is (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), and the value of dp[m] is being printed, which is (dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7). Additionally, if c is equal to r, num is k, k+1, ..., or 2k-1, otherwise num is k+1, k+2, ..., or 2k and c is not equal to r. m is not equal to 0 and is not equal to 1, dp is a list of m+1 elements where dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(3, m + 1):
    dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0 and is at least `k` less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is equal to its original value, `i` is 4, `m` is at least 3, `num` is either `k`, `k+1`, `k+2`, ..., or `2k`, `c` is an integer read from the input, `r` is an integer read from the input, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for `i` in the range of 3 to `m + 1`, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, and the value of `dp[m]` is being printed, which is `(dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `dp[4]` is `(dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, and `dp[3]` is `(dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. Additionally, if `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is `k`, `k+1`, ..., or `2k-1`, otherwise `num` is `k+1`, `k+2`, ..., or `2k` and `c` is not equal to `r`. `m` is not equal to 0 and is not equal to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0 and is at least `k` less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is equal to its original value, `i` is 5, `m` is at least 5, `num` is either `k`, `k+1`, `k+2`, ..., or `2k`, `c` is an integer read from the input, `r` is an integer read from the input, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is `(dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `dp[4]` is `(dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, and `dp[5]` is `(dp[4] + 4 * dp[3] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, and the value of `dp[m]` is being printed, which is `(dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, and if `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is `k`, `k+1`, ..., or `2k-1`, otherwise `num` is `k+1`, `k+2`, ..., or `2k` and `c` is not equal to `r`. `m` is not equal to 0 and is not equal to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0 and is at least `k` less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is equal to its original value, `i` is 6, `m` is at least 6, `num` is either `k`, `k+1`, `k+2`, ..., or `2k`, `c` is an integer read from the input, `r` is an integer read from the input, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is `(dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `dp[4]` is `(dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `dp[5]` is `(dp[4] + 4 * dp[3] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `dp[6]` is `(dp[5] + 5 * dp[4] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, and the value of `dp[m]` is being printed, which is `(dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, and if `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is `k`, `k+1`, ..., or `2k-1`, otherwise `num` is `k+1`, `k+2`, ..., or `2k` and `c` is not equal to `r`. `m` is not equal to 0 and is not equal to 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
