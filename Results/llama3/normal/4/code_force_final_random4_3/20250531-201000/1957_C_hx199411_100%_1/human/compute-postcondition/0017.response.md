Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to `n` inclusive, `i` is 3, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is either 3, 4 or 5, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains `k-3` lines, each containing two integers `r_i` and `c_i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `num` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be 3, 4, or 5. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin is still one less than the original number of test cases, and each test case still contains `k-3` lines with two integers each.
