Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when the game continues after k moves. The program first calculates the number of positions that are already occupied by rooks, and then uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations for the remaining positions. The dynamic programming approach is correct, as it considers all possible ways to place rooks in the remaining positions and ensures that no two rooks attack each other. The program also correctly handles the case where there are no valid moves remaining, in which case the number of possible configurations is 1. The program also correctly handles the case where there is only one valid move remaining, in which case the number of possible configurations is also 1.

Correctness: **True**
