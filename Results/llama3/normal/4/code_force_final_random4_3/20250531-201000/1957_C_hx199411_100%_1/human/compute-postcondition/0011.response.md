Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to `n` inclusive, `num` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 2, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains `k-2` lines, each containing two integers `r_i` and `c_i`. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `i` remain unchanged. The value of `num` is still dependent on the values of `c` and `r`. The stdin now contains one less test case, and each test case contains one less line of input. The values of `c` and `r` are updated to the new input values.
