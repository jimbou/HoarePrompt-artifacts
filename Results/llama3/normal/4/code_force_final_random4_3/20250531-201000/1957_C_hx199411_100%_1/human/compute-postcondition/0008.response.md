Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `num` is 2, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains `k-1` lines, each containing two integers `r_i` and `c_i`. `c` is not equal to `r`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still greater than 0 and is one less than its original value. `n` is still an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive. `k` is still an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive. `num` has been incremented by 2 and is now 2. `i` is still 1. `c` and `r` are still integers. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains `k-1` lines, each containing two integers `r_i` and `c_i`. `c` is still not equal to `r`.
