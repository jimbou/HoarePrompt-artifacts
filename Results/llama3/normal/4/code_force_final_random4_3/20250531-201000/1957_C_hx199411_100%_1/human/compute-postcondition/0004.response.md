Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, num is 0, i is 1, c and r are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains k-1 lines, each containing two integers r_i and c_i**

In this output state, the values of t, n, k, and num remain unchanged. The variable i has been incremented by 1. The variables c and r have been assigned the values of the two integers from the input. The stdin now contains one less test case, with each test case having one less line of input.
