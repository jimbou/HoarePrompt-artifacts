Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer between 0 and n inclusive, num is 0, i is equal to k if m is 0 or 1, otherwise i is equal to m+1, m is an integer between n - 2k and n - k inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains 0 lines.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if c == r:
        num += 1
    else:
        num += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to `k` if `m` is 0 or 1, otherwise `i` is equal to `m+1`, `m` is an integer between `n - 2k` and `n - k` inclusive, `c` and `r` are integers. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2. stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, each test case contains 0 lines.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to `k` if `m` is 0 or 1, otherwise `i` is equal to `m+2`, `m` is an integer between `n - 2k` and `n - k` inclusive, `c` and `r` are integers that were read from the input, if `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 2, otherwise `num` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, each test case contains 0 lines.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between `i+1` and n inclusive, `i` is equal to `k+1` if `m` is 0 or 1, otherwise `i` is equal to `m+3`, `m` is an integer between `n - 2k` and `n - k` inclusive, `c` and `r` are integers that were read from the input, if `c` equals `r`, then `num` is either 3 or 4, otherwise `num` is either 3 or 5, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, each test case contains 0 lines.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
