Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `num` is an integer between `k` and 2*`k` inclusive, `i` is 3, `m` is at least 3 and is an integer between `n` - 2*`k` and `n` - `k` inclusive, is not equal to 0 and is not equal to 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains 0 lines, dp is a list of length `m`+1 with dp[1] = 1, dp[2] = 3, dp[3] = (dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7) = (3 + 2 * 2 * 1) % (10 ** 9 + 7) = 7 and all other elements are 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains the same, `n`, `k`, `num`, `i`, and `m` also remain the same. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains 0 lines. The list `dp` has been updated with a new value at index 3, which is calculated using the values at indices 1 and 2. The new value at index 3 is 7. All other elements in the list `dp` remain 0.
