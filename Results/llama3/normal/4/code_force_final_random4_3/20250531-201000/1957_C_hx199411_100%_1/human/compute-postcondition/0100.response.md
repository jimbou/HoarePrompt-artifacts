Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is at least 2 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `m` is equal to `n - 2k` or `n - 2k - 1`, `num` is either 3, 4, 5 or 6, `c` is an integer read from the input, `r` is an integer read from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus k - 1, each test case contains 0 lines. If `m` is 0, the number 1 is being printed. If `m` is 1, the number 1 is printed. If `m` is not 1, `n` is at least 2k + 4, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `m` is equal to `n - 2k - 1` and is at least 3, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for `i` in the range of 3 to `m + 1`, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, and the value of `dp[m]` is being printed, which is `(dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. Additionally, if `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 3 or 4 or 5, otherwise `num` is 4 or 5 or 6 and `c` is not equal to `r`.**

The value of `num` has been incremented by 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `num` is now either 3, 4, 5, or 6. The rest of the conditions and variables remain the same as in the initial state.
