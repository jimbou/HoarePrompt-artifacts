Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to `n` inclusive, `i` is 3, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is either 6, 7 or 8, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains `k-3` lines, each containing two integers `r_i` and `c_i`.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to be either 6, 7, or 8, which is 2 more than its original value. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, each with `k-3` lines of two integers `r_i` and `c_i`.
