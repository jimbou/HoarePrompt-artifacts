The code `x, p = stack[-1]` assigns the last element of the `stack` list to the variables `x` and `p`. Since the `stack` list contains a tuple `(1, 1)`, the values of `x` and `p` will be `1` and `1`, respectively.

Output State: **A is a positive integer, g is a dictionary representing a tree with n vertices, k is a non-negative integer less than n, stack is a list containing a tuple (1, 1), visited is an empty set, d is a dictionary containing a key-value pair (1, 1), r is 0, x is 1, and p is 1.**
