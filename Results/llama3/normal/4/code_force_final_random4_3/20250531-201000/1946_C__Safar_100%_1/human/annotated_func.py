#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k < n, and edges is a list of pairs of integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive).
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k < n, edges is an empty list, g is a list of n+1 lists where the first list is empty, and for each pair of integers (a, b) that was in edges, the a-th list contains b and the b-th list contains a.
    c = 0
    l = 1
    r = n // k
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
        
    #State: l is the smallest integer such that check(l) is true and r is the largest integer such that check(r) is false.
    print(r)
    #This is printed: the largest integer for which check returns false

#Overall this is what the function does:This function constructs an undirected graph from a list of edges and then performs a binary search to find the largest integer for which the check function returns false. The function takes three parameters: n (a positive integer), k (a positive integer less than n), and edges (a list of pairs of integers representing the edges of the graph). It returns the largest integer for which the check function returns false. The function modifies the input list of edges by emptying it and creates a new data structure (g) to represent the graph. The function also prints the result, but this is not considered part of its return value.
