Postcondition: ***A is a positive integer, g is a dictionary representing a tree with n vertices where g[1] has at least 2 nodes, k is a non-negative integer less than n, if the second node in the list g[x] is not equal to p, then the stack is a list containing tuples (1, 1) and (node, x) and (node, x), otherwise the stack remains a list containing a tuple (1, 1), visited is a set containing 1, d is a dictionary containing a key-value pair (1, 1), r is 0, x is 1, and p is 1.***
