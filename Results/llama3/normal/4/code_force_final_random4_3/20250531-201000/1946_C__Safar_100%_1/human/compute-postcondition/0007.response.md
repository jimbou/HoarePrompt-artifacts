Output State: **A is a positive integer, g is a dictionary representing a tree with n vertices where g[1] is not empty, k is a non-negative integer less than n, stack is a list containing tuples (1, 1) and (node, x), visited is a set containing 1, d is a dictionary containing a key-value pair (1, 1), r is 0, x is 1, and p is 1. The current value of node is not equal to p, and node is the first node in g[1].**

In this output state, the only change is that the stack now contains an additional tuple (node, x), where node is the first node in g[1] and x is 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
