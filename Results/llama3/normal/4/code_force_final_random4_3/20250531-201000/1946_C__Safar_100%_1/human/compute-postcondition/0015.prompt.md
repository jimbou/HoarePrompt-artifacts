Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: A is a positive integer, g is a dictionary representing a tree with n vertices, k is a non-negative integer less than n, stack is a list containing a tuple (1, 1), visited is a set containing 1, d is a dictionary containing a key-value pair (1, 1), r is 0, x is 1, and p is 1.
Code of the loop:
for node in g[x]:
    if node != p:
        stack.append((node, x))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *A is a positive integer, g is a dictionary representing a tree with n vertices where g[1] is not empty, k is a non-negative integer less than n, stack is a list containing tuples (1, 1) and (node, x) if the first node in g[1] is not equal to p, otherwise it remains a list containing a tuple (1, 1), visited is a set containing 1, d is a dictionary containing a key-value pair (1, 1), r is 0, x is 1, and p is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *A is a positive integer, g is a dictionary representing a tree with n vertices where g[1] has at least 2 nodes, k is a non-negative integer less than n, if the second node in the list g[x] is not equal to p, then the stack is a list containing tuples (1, 1) and (node, x) and (node, x), otherwise the stack remains a list containing a tuple (1, 1), visited is a set containing 1, d is a dictionary containing a key-value pair (1, 1), r is 0, x is 1, and p is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *A is a positive integer, g is a dictionary representing a tree with n vertices where g[1] has at least 3 nodes, k is a non-negative integer less than n, if the third node in the list g[x] is not equal to p, then the stack is a list containing tuples (1, 1) and (node, x) and (node, x), otherwise the stack remains a list containing a tuple (1, 1), visited is a set containing 1, d is a dictionary containing a key-value pair (1, 1), r is 0, x is 1, and p is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
