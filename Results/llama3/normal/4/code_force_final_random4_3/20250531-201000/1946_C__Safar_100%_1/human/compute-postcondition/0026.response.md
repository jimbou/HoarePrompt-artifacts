Output State: **l is the smallest integer such that check(l) is true and r is the largest integer such that check(r) is false.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `l` will be the smallest integer for which the function `check(l)` returns `True`, and the variable `r` will be the largest integer for which the function `check(r)` returns `False`. This is because the loop continues to narrow down the range of possible values for `l` and `r` until `l` is greater than `r`, at which point the loop terminates.
