This function constructs an undirected graph from a list of edges and then performs a binary search to find the largest integer for which the check function returns false. The function takes three parameters: n (a positive integer), k (a positive integer less than n), and edges (a list of pairs of integers representing the edges of the graph). It returns the largest integer for which the check function returns false. The function modifies the input list of edges by emptying it and creates a new data structure (g) to represent the graph. The function also prints the result, but this is not considered part of its return value.
