Output: **n is an integer, f is an integer minus one, k is an integer minus one, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is the integer at index f in the original list a, stdin is empty. The integer at index k in the list a is less than or equal to the integer at index f in the list a. The current value of the integer at index k in the list a is less than the current value of x, and 'YES' is printed**
