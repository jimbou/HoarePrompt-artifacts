Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, f, and k (1 <= f, k <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 100).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    f -= 1
    k -= 1
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x = a[f]
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    if a[k] > x:
        print('NO')
    elif a[k] < x:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k + 1] < x else 'MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer, f is an integer minus one, k is an integer minus one, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is the integer at index f in the original list a, stdin is empty. If the integer at index k in the list a is greater than the integer at index f in the list a, 'NO' is printed. If the integer at index k in the list a is less than or equal to the integer at index f in the list a, 'YES' is printed if k is equal to n - 1 or the integer at index k + 1 in the list a is less than the integer at index f in the list a, otherwise 'MAYBE' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is the integer at index f in the list a, stdin is empty. If the integer at index k in the list a is greater than x, 'NO' is printed. If the integer at index k in the list a is less than x, 'YES' is printed. If the integer at index k in the list a is equal to x, either 'YES' or 'MAYBE' is printed depending on whether k is equal to n - 1 or the integer at index k + 1 in the list a is less than x.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is the integer at index f in the list a, stdin is empty. If a[k] is greater than x, 'NO' is printed. If a[k] is less than x, 'YES' is printed. If a[k] is equal to x, if k is equal to n - 1 or the integer at index k + 1 in the list a is less than the integer at index f in the list a, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'MAYBE' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
