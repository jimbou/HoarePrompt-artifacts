Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the favorite cube has the same value as the k-th cube, but there are other cubes with the same value that are not removed. In this case, the program will print 'YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k + 1] < x, but it should print 'MAYBE' because the favorite cube may or may not be removed.

For example, if n=5, f=2, k=2, and a=[4, 3, 3, 3, 2], the program will print 'YES', but the correct answer is 'MAYBE' because the favorite cube may or may not be removed.

The correct solution should check if there are other cubes with the same value as the favorite cube that are not removed, and print 'MAYBE' in this case.
