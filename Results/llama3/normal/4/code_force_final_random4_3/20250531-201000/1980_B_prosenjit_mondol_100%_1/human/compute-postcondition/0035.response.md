Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, f, k) and a list of n integers. It then determines whether the integer at index f in the sorted list is greater than, less than, or equal to the integer at index k. Based on this comparison, it prints 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' to indicate whether the integer at index f is greater than or equal to the integer at index k, or if it's uncertain. The function processes multiple test cases and prints the result for each case.**
