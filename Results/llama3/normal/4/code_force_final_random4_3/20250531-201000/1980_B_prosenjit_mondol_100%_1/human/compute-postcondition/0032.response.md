Postcondition: ***n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is the integer at index f in the list a, stdin is empty. If a[k] is less than x, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if k is equal to n - 1 or the integer at index k + 1 in the list a is less than the integer at index f in the list a, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'MAYBE' is printed.***
