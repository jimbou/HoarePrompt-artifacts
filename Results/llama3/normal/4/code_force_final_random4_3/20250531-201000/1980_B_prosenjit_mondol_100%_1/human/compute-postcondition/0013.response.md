Postcondition: ***n is an integer, f is an integer minus one, k is an integer minus one, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is the integer at index f in the original list a, stdin is empty. If the integer at index k in the list a is greater than the integer at index f in the list a, 'NO' is printed. If the integer at index k in the list a is less than or equal to the integer at index f in the list a, 'YES' is printed if k is equal to n - 1 or the integer at index k + 1 in the list a is less than the integer at index f in the list a, otherwise 'MAYBE' is printed.***
