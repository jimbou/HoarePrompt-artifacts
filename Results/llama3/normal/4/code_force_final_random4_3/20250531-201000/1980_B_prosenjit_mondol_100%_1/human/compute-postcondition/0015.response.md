Output State: **n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is the integer at index f in the list a, stdin is empty**

In this final state, the values of n, f, and k have been updated to the integers read from the input. The list a has been sorted in descending order, and x now holds the value of the integer at index f in the sorted list a. The stdin is empty after reading the input.
