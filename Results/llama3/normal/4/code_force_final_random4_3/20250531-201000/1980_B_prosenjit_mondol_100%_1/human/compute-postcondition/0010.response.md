The code prints 'YES' if k is equal to n minus one or the integer at index k plus one in the list a is less than the integer at index f in the list a, otherwise it prints 'MAYBE'. Where n is an integer, k is an integer minus one, f is an integer minus one, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, and x is the integer at index f in the original list a.
Output: **YES (if k is equal to n minus one or the integer at index k plus one in the list a is less than the integer at index f in the list a), MAYBE (otherwise)**
