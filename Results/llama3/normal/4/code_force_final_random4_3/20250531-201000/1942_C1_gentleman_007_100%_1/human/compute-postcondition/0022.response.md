Output State: **All nodes in the graph have been visited, the deque `q` contains all nodes from the graph, `ver` is assigned the value of the leftmost node in the deque `q`, the leftmost node in the deque `q` which is `ver` has been printed, graph[ver] must have at least 1 node, node is the first node in the graph[ver] and the current value of `node` is visited.**

Explanation: The first line appends the value of `node` to the deque `q`, effectively adding it to the end of the deque. Since `q` initially contained more than all nodes from the graph minus one node, adding `node` makes it contain all nodes from the graph. The second line assigns the value 1 to `vis[node]`, marking the node as visited. The value of `ver` remains unchanged, still assigned to the leftmost node in the deque `q`, which has been printed. The graph[ver] still has at least 1 node, and `node` is still the first node in the graph[ver], but its value is now marked as visited.
