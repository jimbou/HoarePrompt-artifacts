The only objects in the loop head are variables  node and graph[ver], so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the graph[ver].  If the graph[ver] has at least 2 nodes the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, graph[ver] has at least 1 node, node is the first node in the graph[ver], and all nodes in graph[ver] are marked as visited if they were not visited before, otherwise nothing changes. So for the loop to be executed one more time the graph[ver] must have at least 2 nodes and the node is the second node in the graph[ver].
State: **All nodes in the graph have been visited, the deque `q` contains at least one node that has not been visited before, `ver` is assigned the value of the new leftmost node in the deque `q`, the leftmost node in the deque `q` which is `ver` has been printed, graph[ver] must have at least 2 nodes, node is the second node in the graph[ver], and all nodes in graph[ver] are marked as visited if they were not visited before, otherwise nothing changes, and this is printed: the value of `ver` (the new leftmost node in the deque `q`) followed by a space. Additionally, if the node was not visited before, it is now marked as visited.**
