Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists of elements of any type and value, and they are not empty, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, where `dp[i][j]` is the length of the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` ending at index `i - 1` in `a` and `j - 1` in `b`, for all `i` from 1 to `len(a)` and `j` from 1 to `len(b)`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is `len(a)`, `j` is `len(b) - 3`, and `l` is an empty list. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`, then `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `j` is `len(b)`, and `l` is an empty list. Otherwise, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `j` is `len(b) - 3`, and `l` is a list containing the last element of `a`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`, then `i` is decreased by 1. `i` must be greater than 0 and `j` must be greater than 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `j` has been decremented by 1. This means that `j` is now one less than its previous value, and all the conditions and relationships between the variables remain the same.
