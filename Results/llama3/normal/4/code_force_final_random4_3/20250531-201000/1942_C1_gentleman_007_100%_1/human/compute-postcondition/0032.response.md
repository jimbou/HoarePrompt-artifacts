Output State: **All nodes in the graph have been visited, the deque `q` contains at least one node that has not been visited before, `ver` is assigned the value of the new leftmost node in the deque `q`, the leftmost node in the deque `q` which is `ver` has been printed, graph[ver] must have all nodes visited, and all nodes in graph[ver] are marked as visited if they were not visited before, otherwise nothing changes.**

In natural language, the output state is: The deque `q` has been updated by removing the leftmost node, and the variable `ver` now holds the value of the new leftmost node in the deque `q`. All other conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
