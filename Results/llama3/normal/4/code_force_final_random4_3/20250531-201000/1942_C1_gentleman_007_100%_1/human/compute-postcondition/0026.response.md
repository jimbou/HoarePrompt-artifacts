Postcondition: ***All nodes in the graph have been visited, the deque `q` contains all nodes from the graph plus the node if it was not visited before, `ver` is assigned the value of the leftmost node in the deque `q`, the leftmost node in the deque `q` which is `ver` has been printed, graph[ver] must have at least 2 nodes, node is the second node in the graph[ver] and the current value of `node` is visited if it was not visited before, otherwise nothing changes.***
