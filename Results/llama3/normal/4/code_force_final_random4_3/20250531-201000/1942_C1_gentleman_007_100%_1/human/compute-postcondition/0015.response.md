Output State: **All nodes in the graph have been visited and added to the deque `q`, and the deque `q` contains all nodes from the graph.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, all nodes in the graph have been visited and added to the deque `q`, and the deque `q` now contains all nodes from the graph. The `vis` list or dictionary will have all nodes marked as visited (i.e., `vis[i]` will be 1 for all nodes `i` in the graph). The `graph` dictionary remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the loop.
