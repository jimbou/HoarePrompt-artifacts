Output State: **ver is the next node in the deque q, graph is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes that must have at least 2 neighboring nodes for the node ver, q is a deque containing nodes from the graph with one node removed from the left and the node appended to the right if the node has not been visited, vis is a list or dictionary where vis[i] represents whether node i has been visited or not, with vis[ver] being 1 and vis[node] being 1, and the next node in the deque which is ver is printed, node is the second neighboring node in the list and is now in the deque q and has been visited.**

The code adds the second neighboring node to the deque q and marks it as visited. The deque q now contains the second neighboring node, and the node has been visited. The graph and the deque q remain unchanged except for the addition of the second neighboring node. The vis list or dictionary is updated to reflect that the second neighboring node has been visited.
