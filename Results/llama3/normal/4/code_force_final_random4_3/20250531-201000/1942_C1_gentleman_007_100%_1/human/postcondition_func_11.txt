This function takes a positive integer `num` and a list of integers `Prime_array` as input, where `Prime_array[i]` is a prime factor of `i+1` for all `i` in the range of `Prime_array`. It returns a dictionary containing the prime factors of the original value of `num` as keys and their respective counts in the prime factorization of `num` as values. If `num` is 1, the function returns an empty dictionary, as 1 has no prime factors.
