Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists of elements of any type and value, and they are not empty, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, where `dp[i][j]` is the length of the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` ending at index `i - 1` in `a` and `j - 1` in `b`, for all `i` from 1 to `len(a)` and `j` from 1 to `len(b)`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is `len(a)`, `j` is `len(b) - 1`, and `l` is an empty list. Otherwise, if `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`, then `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `j` is `len(b)`, and `l` is an empty list. Otherwise, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `j` is `len(b) - 1`, and `l` is a list containing the last element of `a`. `i` must be greater than 0 and `j` must be greater than 0, and `i` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `i` is decreased by 1. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the 2D list `dp` remains the same. The conditions for `i`, `j`, and `l` are still valid, but `i` is now one less than its original value.
