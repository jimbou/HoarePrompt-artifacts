Output State: **a and b are lists of elements of any type and value, and they are not empty, dp is a 2D list of size (len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1), where dp[i][j] is the length of the longest common subsequence of a and b ending at index i - 1 in a and j - 1 in b, for all i from 1 to len(a) and j from 1 to len(b), i is len(a) - 1, j is len(b) - 1, and l is a list containing the last element of a.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, containing elements of any type and value, and are not empty. The 2D list `dp` still has the same size and structure, with `dp[i][j]` representing the length of the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` ending at index `i - 1` in `a` and `j - 1` in `b`. The values of `i` and `j` have been decremented by 1, so `i` is now `len(a) - 1` and `j` is now `len(b) - 1`. The list `l` now contains the last element of `a`, which was appended to it.
