Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists of elements of any type and value, and they are not empty, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, where `dp[i][j]` is the length of the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` ending at index `i - 1` in `a` and `j - 1` in `b`, for all `i` from 1 to `len(a)` and `j` from 1 to `len(b)`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `a` and `b` remain unchanged as lists of elements of any type and value, and they are not empty. The 2D list `dp` has a size of `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, where each element `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` ending at index `i - 1` in `a` and `j - 1` in `b`, for all `i` from 1 to `len(a)` and `j` from 1 to `len(b)`.
