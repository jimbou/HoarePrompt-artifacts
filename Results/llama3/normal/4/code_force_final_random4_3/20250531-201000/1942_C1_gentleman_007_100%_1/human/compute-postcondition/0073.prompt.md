Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a and b are lists of elements of any type and value, and they are not empty, dp is a 2D list of size (len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1), where dp[i][j] is the length of the longest common subsequence of a and b ending at index i - 1 in a and j - 1 in b, for all i from 1 to len(a) and j from 1 to len(b), i is len(a), j is len(b), and l is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while i != 0 and j != 0:
    if dp[i][j] == dp[i][j - 1]:
        j -= 1
    elif dp[i][j] == dp[i - 1][j]:
        i -= 1
    else:
        i -= 1
        j -= 1
        l.append(a[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` and `b` are lists of elements of any type and value, and they are not empty, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, where `dp[i][j]` is the length of the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` ending at index `i - 1` in `a` and `j - 1` in `b`, for all `i` from 1 to `len(a)` and `j` from 1 to `len(b)`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is `len(a)`, `j` is `len(b) - 1`, and `l` is an empty list. Otherwise, if `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`, then `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `j` is `len(b)`, and `l` is an empty list. Otherwise, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `j` is `len(b) - 1`, and `l` is a list containing the last element of `a`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`a` and `b` are lists of elements of any type and value, and they are not empty, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, where `dp[i][j]` is the length of the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` ending at index `i - 1` in `a` and `j - 1` in `b`, for all `i` from 1 to `len(a)` and `j` from 1 to `len(b)`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is `len(a)`, `j` is `len(b) - 2`, and `l` is an empty list. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`, then `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `j` is `len(b)`, and `l` is an empty list. Otherwise, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `j` is `len(b) - 2`, and `l` is a list containing the last element of `a`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`, then `i` is decreased by 1. `i` must be greater than 0 and `j` must be greater than 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`a` and `b` are lists of elements of any type and value, and they are not empty, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, where `dp[i][j]` is the length of the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` ending at index `i - 1` in `a` and `j - 1` in `b`, for all `i` from 1 to `len(a)` and `j` from 1 to `len(b)`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is `len(a)`, `j` is `len(b) - 3`, and `l` is an empty list. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`, then `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `j` is `len(b)`, and `l` is an empty list. Otherwise, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `j` is `len(b) - 3`, and `l` is a list containing the last element of `a`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`, then `i` is decreased by 1. If `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `j` is `len(b) - 1`, and `l` is a list containing the last element of `a`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
