The function creates and returns a list containing 'n' elements, all of which are the value 'v'. The function accepts two parameters: 'n', a non-negative integer representing the number of elements in the list, and 'v', a value of any type that will be used to populate the list. The function does not modify any external state or have any side effects beyond returning the newly created list.
