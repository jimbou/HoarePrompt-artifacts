This function performs a binary search on a sorted list of integers to find the index of the largest element that is less than or equal to a given integer. If the list is empty or the first element is greater than the given integer, it returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the index of the largest element that is less than or equal to the given integer, or the index of the first element that is greater than the given integer if no such element exists.
