Postcondition: **All nodes in the graph have been visited, the deque `q` contains at least one node that has not been visited before, `ver` is assigned the value of the new leftmost node in the deque `q`, the leftmost node in the deque `q` which is `ver` has been printed, graph[ver] must have at least 1 node, node is the first node in the graph[ver], and all nodes in graph[ver] are marked as visited if they were not visited before, otherwise nothing changes, and this is printed: the value of `ver` (the new leftmost node in the deque `q`) followed by a space. The current value of node is not visited.**
