Reasoning: The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be obtained from a regular polygon with n sides, where x vertices have already been chosen and y additional vertices can be chosen. The program correctly reads the input, initializes variables, and calculates the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake using a simple and efficient algorithm. The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when the number of chosen vertices is equal to the number of sides of the polygon. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
