Output State: **`ver` is the next node in the deque `q`, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes that must have at least 1 neighboring node for the node `ver`, `q` is a deque containing nodes from the graph with one node removed from the left and the node appended to the right, `vis` is a list or dictionary where `vis[i]` represents whether node `i` has been visited or not, with `vis[ver]` being 1 and `vis[node]` being 1, and the next node in the deque which is `ver` is printed, node is the first neighboring node in the list.**

The code appends the neighboring node to the deque `q` and marks it as visited by setting `vis[node]` to 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
