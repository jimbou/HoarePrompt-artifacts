According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `node` and `graph[ver]`. If `graph[ver]` has at least 1 node the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, all nodes in the graph have been visited, the deque `q` contains at least one node that has not been visited before, `ver` is assigned the value of the new leftmost node in the deque `q`, the leftmost node in the deque `q` which is `ver` has been printed, graph[ver] must have all nodes visited, and all nodes in graph[ver] are marked as visited if they were not visited before, otherwise nothing changes, and this is printed: the value of `ver` (the new leftmost node in the deque `q`) followed by a space. So for the loop to be executed  the graph[ver] must have at least 1 node and the node is the first node in the graph[ver].
State: **All nodes in the graph have been visited, the deque `q` contains at least one node that has not been visited before, `ver` is assigned the value of the new leftmost node in the deque `q`, the leftmost node in the deque `q` which is `ver` has been printed, graph[ver] must have at least 1 node, node is the first node in the graph[ver], and all nodes in graph[ver] are marked as visited if they were not visited before, otherwise nothing changes, and this is printed: the value of `ver` (the new leftmost node in the deque `q`) followed by a space**
