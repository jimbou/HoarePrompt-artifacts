Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists of elements of any type and value, and they are not empty, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, where `dp[i][j]` is the length of the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` ending at index `i - 1` in `a` and `j - 1` in `b`, for all `i` from 1 to `len(a)` and `j` from 1 to `len(b)`, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `j` is `len(b)`, and `l` is an empty list. Additionally, `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`. The current value of `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the 2D list `dp` still stores the lengths of the longest common subsequences of `a` and `b`. The variable `i` has been decremented by 1, so it now holds the value `len(a) - 1`, while `j` remains unchanged at `len(b)`. The list `l` is still empty. The relationship between `dp[i][j]` and `dp[i][j - 1]` remains the same, and the current value of `dp[i][j]` is still equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`.
