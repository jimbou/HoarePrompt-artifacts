Postcondition: ***`ver` is the next node in the deque `q`, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes that must have at least 1 neighboring node for the node `ver`, `q` is a deque containing nodes from the graph with one node removed from the left, `vis` is a list or dictionary where `vis[i]` represents whether node `i` has been visited or not, with `vis[ver]` being 1, and the next node in the deque which is `ver` is printed, node is the first neighboring node in the list. The current value of `vis[node]` is 0, indicating that node has not been visited.***
