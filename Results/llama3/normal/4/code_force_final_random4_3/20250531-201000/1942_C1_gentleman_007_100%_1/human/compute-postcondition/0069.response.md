Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists of elements of any type and value, and they are not empty, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, where `dp[i][j]` is the length of the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` ending at index `i - 1` in `a` and `j - 1` in `b`, for all `i` from 1 to `len(a)` and `j` from 1 to `len(b)`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is `len(a)`, `j` is `len(b) - 2`, and `l` is an empty list. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`, then `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `j` is `len(b)`, and `l` is an empty list. Otherwise, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `j` is `len(b) - 2`, and `l` is a list containing the last element of `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the 2D list `dp` still stores the lengths of the longest common subsequences of `a` and `b`. The value of `i` has been decreased by 1, so it is now `len(a) - 2` if `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`, and `len(a) - 1` otherwise. The value of `j` remains the same, and the list `l` is either empty or contains the last element of `a`, depending on the values of `dp[i][j]`, `dp[i][j - 1]`, and `dp[i - 1][j]`.
