Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: All nodes in the graph have been visited, the deque `q` contains more than all nodes from the graph minus one node, and `ver` is assigned the value of the leftmost node in the deque `q`, and the leftmost node in the deque `q` which is `ver` is being printed
Code of the loop:
for node in graph[ver]:
    if not vis[node]:
        q.append(node)
        vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *All nodes in the graph have been visited, the deque `q` contains all nodes from the graph, `ver` is assigned the value of the leftmost node in the deque `q`, the leftmost node in the deque `q` which is `ver` has been printed, graph[ver] must have at least 1 node, node is the first node in the graph[ver] and the current value of `node` is visited if it was not visited before, otherwise nothing changes.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *All nodes in the graph have been visited, the deque `q` contains all nodes from the graph plus the node if it was not visited before, `ver` is assigned the value of the leftmost node in the deque `q`, the leftmost node in the deque `q` which is `ver` has been printed, graph[ver] must have at least 2 nodes, node is the second node in the graph[ver] and the current value of `node` is visited if it was not visited before, otherwise nothing changes.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *All nodes in the graph have been visited, the deque `q` contains all nodes from the graph plus the node if it was not visited before, `ver` is assigned the value of the leftmost node in the deque `q`, the leftmost node in the deque `q` which is `ver` has been printed, graph[ver] must have at least 3 nodes, and the third node in the graph[ver] is marked as visited if it was not visited before, otherwise nothing changes.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
