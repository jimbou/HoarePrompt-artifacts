To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the loop condition: `i != 0 and j != 0`. This means both `i` and `j` must be non-zero for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are lists of elements of any type and value, and they are not empty.
- `dp` is a 2D list of size `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, where `dp[i][j]` is the length of the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` ending at index `i - 1` in `a` and `j - 1` in `b`, for all `i` from 1 to `len(a)` and `j` from 1 to `len(b)`.
- `i` is `len(a)`.
- `j` is `len(b)`.
- `l` is an empty list.

Since `i` and `j` are already defined as lengths of non-empty lists `a` and `b` respectively, they are inherently non-zero. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states of `i` and `j` for the loop to execute the first time.

However, to explicitly state that `i` and `j` are non-zero (which is a requirement for the loop to execute), we can rephrase their states to reflect this, although it's redundant given the context:

State: **`a` and `b` are lists of elements of any type and value, and they are not empty, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, `i` is a non-zero value equal to `len(a)`, `j` is a non-zero value equal to `len(b)`, and `l` is an empty list.**

But since the original task was to modify the state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, and given that the conditions are already met with the provided states, the most accurate response following the format would be to simply repeat the original state, as no adjustments are necessary:

State: **`a` and `b` are lists of elements of any type and value, and they are not empty, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, where `dp[i][j]` is the length of the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` ending at index `i - 1` in `a` and `j - 1` in `b`, for all `i` from 1 to `len(a)` and `j` from 1 to `len(b)`, `i` is `len(a)`, `j` is `len(b)`, and `l` is an empty list.**
