Output State: **All nodes in the graph have been visited, the deque `q` contains all nodes from the graph plus the nodes that were not visited before, `ver` is assigned the value of the leftmost node in the deque `q`, the leftmost node in the deque `q` which is `ver` has been printed, graph[ver] must have all nodes visited, and all nodes in graph[ver] are marked as visited if they were not visited before, otherwise nothing changes.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, all nodes in the graph have been visited and marked as such. The deque `q` contains all nodes from the graph, plus any additional nodes that were not visited before the loop started. The variable `ver` is assigned the value of the leftmost node in the deque `q`, and this node has been printed. The graph `graph[ver]` has all its nodes visited, and any nodes in `graph[ver]` that were not visited before the loop started are now marked as visited.
