The variable in the loop head is variable q, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable q.  If q is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, q contains all nodes from the graph, So for the loop to be executed one more time q must contain more than all nodes from the graph.
State: **All nodes in the graph have been visited and added to the deque `q`, and the deque `q` contains more than all nodes from the graph**
