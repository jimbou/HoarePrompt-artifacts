Output State: **All nodes in the graph have been visited, the deque `q` is empty, `ver` is assigned the value of the last node in the graph, the last node in the graph which is `ver` has been printed, graph[ver] must have all nodes visited, and all nodes in graph[ver] are marked as visited if they were not visited before, otherwise nothing changes, and this is printed: the value of `ver` (the last node in the graph) followed by a space. Additionally, if the node was not visited before, it is now marked as visited. If the node was not visited before, the deque `q` now contains the node that was previously the last node in graph[ver].**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that all nodes in the graph have been visited, the deque `q` is empty, and the last node in the graph has been printed. All nodes in the graph are marked as visited if they were not visited before, and the deque `q` contains the last node in the graph if it was not visited before.
