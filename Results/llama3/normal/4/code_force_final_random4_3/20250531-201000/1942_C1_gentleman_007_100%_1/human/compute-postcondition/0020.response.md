According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `node` and `graph[ver]`. If `graph[ver]` has at least 1 node, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, all nodes in the graph have been visited, the deque `q` contains more than all nodes from the graph minus one node, and `ver` is assigned the value of the leftmost node in the deque `q`, and the leftmost node in the deque `q` which is `ver` is being printed. So for the loop to be executed  the graph[ver] must have at least 1 node and the node is the first node in the graph[ver].

State: **All nodes in the graph have been visited, the deque `q` contains more than all nodes from the graph minus one node, `ver` is assigned the value of the leftmost node in the deque `q`, the leftmost node in the deque `q` which is `ver` is being printed, graph[ver] must have at least 1 node, node is the first node in the graph[ver]**
