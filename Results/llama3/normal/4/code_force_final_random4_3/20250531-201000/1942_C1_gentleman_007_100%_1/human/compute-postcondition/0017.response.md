Output State: **All nodes in the graph have been visited, the deque `q` contains more than all nodes from the graph minus one node, and `ver` is assigned the value of the leftmost node in the deque `q`**

In this output state, the code has removed the leftmost node from the deque `q` and assigned its value to the variable `ver`. The deque `q` now contains one less node than before, but still contains more than all nodes from the graph. The fact that all nodes in the graph have been visited remains unchanged.
