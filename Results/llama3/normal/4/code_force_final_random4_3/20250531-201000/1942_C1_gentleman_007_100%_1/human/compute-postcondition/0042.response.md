To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for node in graph[ver]:`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that:
- All nodes in the graph have been visited.
- The deque `q` contains at least one node that has not been visited before.
- `ver` is assigned the value of the new leftmost node in the deque `q`.
- The leftmost node in the deque `q`, which is `ver`, has been printed.
- `graph[ver]` must have at least 2 nodes.
- `node` is the second node in the graph[ver].
- All nodes in `graph[ver]` are marked as visited if they were not visited before.

To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust the states as follows:
- `node` should be the next node in `graph[ver]`, which is the third node.
- Since `node` is now the third node in `graph[ver]`, `graph[ver]` must have at least 3 nodes.

The other states remain the same.

State: **All nodes in the graph have been visited, the deque `q` contains at least one node that has not been visited before, `ver` is assigned the value of the new leftmost node in the deque `q`, the leftmost node in the deque `q` which is `ver` has been printed, graph[ver] must have at least 3 nodes, node is the third node in the graph[ver], and all nodes in graph[ver] are marked as visited if they were not visited before, otherwise nothing changes, and this is printed: the value of `ver` (the new leftmost node in the deque `q`) followed by a space. Additionally, if the node was not visited before, it is now marked as visited. If the node was not visited before, the deque `q` now contains the node that was previously the second node in graph[ver].**
