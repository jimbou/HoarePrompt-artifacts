The code prints the value of `ver`, which is the new leftmost node in the deque `q`, followed by a space. Since `ver` is the leftmost node in the deque `q` and has been printed, it is the next node to be visited in the graph traversal. The `end=' '` argument in the print statement adds a space after printing the value of `ver`.

Output: **the new leftmost node in the deque q (which is ver), followed by a space**
