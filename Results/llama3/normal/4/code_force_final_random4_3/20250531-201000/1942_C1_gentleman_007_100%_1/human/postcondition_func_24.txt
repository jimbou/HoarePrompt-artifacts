This function performs a breadth-first traversal of a graph, starting from a given node, and prints the value of each node as it is visited. It marks each visited node as visited and ensures that all nodes in the graph are visited. The function modifies the input graph by marking all visited nodes and prints the values of all nodes in the graph, including the last node visited.
