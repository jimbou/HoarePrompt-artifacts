Output State: **ver is printed, q contains node and ver, vis[node] is 1, vis[ver] is 1**

The code snippet modifies the state of the program by appending the neighboring node `node` to the deque `q` and marking it as visited by setting `vis[node]` to 1. The next node in the deque, which is `ver`, is printed. The state of `ver` remains unchanged, as it is only printed and not modified. The state of `q` is updated to include `node` and `ver`, and the state of `vis` is updated to reflect that `node` and `ver` have been visited.
