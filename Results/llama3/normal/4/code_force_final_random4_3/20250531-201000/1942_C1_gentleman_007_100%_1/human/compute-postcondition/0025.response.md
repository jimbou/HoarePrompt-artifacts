Output State: **All nodes in the graph have been visited, the deque `q` contains all nodes from the graph plus the node, `ver` is assigned the value of the leftmost node in the deque `q`, the leftmost node in the deque `q` which is `ver` has been printed, graph[ver] must have at least 2 nodes, node is the second node in the graph[ver] and the current value of `node` is visited, vis[node] is 1.**

The code appends the node to the deque `q`, which now contains all nodes from the graph plus the node. The value of `ver` remains unchanged as the leftmost node in the deque `q`. The leftmost node in the deque `q`, which is `ver`, has already been printed. The graph[ver] still has at least 2 nodes. The node is still the second node in the graph[ver]. The current value of `node` is visited if it was not visited before, otherwise nothing changes. The value of vis[node] is now 1.
