Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve the "Proof Geometric Construction Can Solve All Love Affairs" problem. The problem requires finding the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be obtained from a regular polygon with n sides, where x vertices are already chosen and y additional vertices can be chosen.

The program correctly reads the input, initializes variables, and calculates the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake. It uses a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles the edge cases properly. For example, it checks if the first and last vertices are adjacent, which is a special case that needs to be handled separately.

The program's output matches the expected output for the given test cases, which further confirms its correctness.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
