The code removes the leftmost node from the deque `q` and assigns it to the variable `ver`. Since `ver` was already a node in the graph and `vis[ver]` was 1, the value of `ver` is updated to the next node in the deque `q`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`ver` is the next node in the deque `q`, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, `q` is a deque containing nodes from the graph with one node removed from the left, and `vis` is a list or dictionary where `vis[i]` represents whether node `i` has been visited or not, with `vis[ver]` being 1**
