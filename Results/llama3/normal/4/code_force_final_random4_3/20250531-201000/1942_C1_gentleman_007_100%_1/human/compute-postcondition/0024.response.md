The only objects in the loop head are variables  node and graph[ver], so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the graph[ver].  If the list has at least 2 nodes the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, graph[ver] has at least 1 node, node is the first node in the graph[ver] and the current value of `node` is visited if it was not visited before, otherwise nothing changes. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 nodes and the node is the second node in the graph[ver].
State: **All nodes in the graph have been visited, the deque `q` contains all nodes from the graph, `ver` is assigned the value of the leftmost node in the deque `q`, the leftmost node in the deque `q` which is `ver` has been printed, graph[ver] must have at least 2 nodes, node is the second node in the graph[ver] and the current value of `node` is visited if it was not visited before, otherwise nothing changes.**
