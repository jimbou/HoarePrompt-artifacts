Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists of elements of any type and value, and they are not empty, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, where `dp[i][j]` is the length of the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` ending at index `i - 1` in `a` and `j - 1` in `b`, for all `i` from 1 to `len(a)` and `j` from 1 to `len(b)`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `l` is a list containing the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` in reverse order, and `s` is a string representation of the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` in reverse order.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, `dp`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The list `l` still contains the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` in reverse order. The new variable `s` is introduced, which is a string representation of the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` in reverse order, obtained by joining the elements of `l` into a single string.
