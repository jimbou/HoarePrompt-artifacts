Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ver is a node in the graph, graph is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, q is a deque containing the node ver, and vis is a list or dictionary where vis[i] represents whether node i has been visited or not, with vis[ver] being 1, indicating that node ver has been visited.
Code of the loop:
while len(q):
    ver = q.popleft()
    print(ver, end=' ')
    for node in graph[ver]:
        if not vis[node]:
            q.append(node)
            vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All nodes in the graph have been visited and added to the deque `q`, and the deque `q` contains all nodes from the graph.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: All nodes in the graph have been visited, the deque `q` contains all nodes from the graph plus the nodes that were not visited before, `ver` is assigned the value of the leftmost node in the deque `q`, the leftmost node in the deque `q` which is `ver` has been printed, graph[ver] must have all nodes visited, and all nodes in graph[ver] are marked as visited if they were not visited before, otherwise nothing changes.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: All nodes in the graph have been visited, the deque `q` is empty, `ver` is assigned the value of the last node in the graph, the last node in the graph which is `ver` has been printed, graph[ver] must have all nodes visited, and all nodes in graph[ver] are marked as visited if they were not visited before, otherwise nothing changes, and this is printed: the value of `ver` (the last node in the graph) followed by a space. Additionally, if the node was not visited before, it is now marked as visited. If the node was not visited before, the deque `q` now contains the node that was previously the last node in graph[ver].


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
