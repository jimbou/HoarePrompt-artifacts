Postcondition: ***`ver` is the next node in the deque `q`, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes that must have at least 2 neighboring nodes for the node `ver`, `q` is a deque containing nodes from the graph with one node removed from the left and the node appended to the right if the node has not been visited, `vis` is a list or dictionary where `vis[i]` represents whether node `i` has been visited or not, with `vis[ver]` being 1. If the second neighboring node `node` has not been visited, it is now in the deque `q` and has been visited. The next node in the deque, which is `ver`, is printed.***
