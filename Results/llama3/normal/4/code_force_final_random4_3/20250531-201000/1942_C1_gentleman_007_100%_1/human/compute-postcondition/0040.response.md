Output State: **All nodes in the graph have been visited, the deque `q` contains at least one node that has not been visited before, `ver` is assigned the value of the new leftmost node in the deque `q`, the leftmost node in the deque `q` which is `ver` has been printed, graph[ver] must have at least 2 nodes, node is the second node in the graph[ver], and all nodes in graph[ver] are marked as visited if they were not visited before, otherwise nothing changes, and this is printed: the value of `ver` (the new leftmost node in the deque `q`) followed by a space. Additionally, if the node was not visited before, it is now marked as visited. The deque `q` now contains the node that was previously the second node in graph[ver]. The node is now marked as visited.**

In this final state, the deque `q` has been updated to include the node that was previously the second node in graph[ver]. This node is now marked as visited, as indicated by the assignment of vis[node] = 1. The value of `ver` remains unchanged, as it was already assigned the value of the new leftmost node in the deque `q`. The graph[ver] still has at least 2 nodes, and all nodes in graph[ver] are marked as visited if they were not visited before. The leftmost node in the deque `q`, which is `ver`, has been printed, followed by a space.
