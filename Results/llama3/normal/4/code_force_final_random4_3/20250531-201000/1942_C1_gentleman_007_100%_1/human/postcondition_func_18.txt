This function performs a binary search on a sorted list of distinct integers to find the index of the smallest element that is greater than or equal to a given integer. If the given integer is larger than the last element in the list, the function returns the length of the list. The function takes a sorted list of distinct integers and an integer as input and returns an index or the length of the list, depending on the relationship between the input integer and the list elements.
