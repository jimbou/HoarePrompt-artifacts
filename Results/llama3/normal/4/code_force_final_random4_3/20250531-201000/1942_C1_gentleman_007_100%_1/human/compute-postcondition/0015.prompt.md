Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ver` is the next node in the deque `q`, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, `q` is a deque containing nodes from the graph with one node removed from the left, and `vis` is a list or dictionary where `vis[i]` represents whether node `i` has been visited or not, with `vis[ver]` being 1, and the next node in the deque which is `ver` is printed
Code of the loop:
for node in graph[ver]:
    if not vis[node]:
        q.append(node)
        vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ver` is the next node in the deque `q`, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes that must have at least 1 neighboring node for the node `ver`, `q` is a deque containing nodes from the graph with one node removed from the left and the node appended to the right if the node has not been visited, `vis` is a list or dictionary where `vis[i]` represents whether node `i` has been visited or not, with `vis[ver]` being 1 and `vis[node]` being 1 if the node has not been visited, and the next node in the deque which is `ver` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ver` is the next node in the deque `q`, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes that must have at least 2 neighboring nodes for the node `ver`, `q` is a deque containing nodes from the graph with one node removed from the left and the node appended to the right if the node has not been visited, `vis` is a list or dictionary where `vis[i]` represents whether node `i` has been visited or not, with `vis[ver]` being 1. If the second neighboring node `node` has not been visited, it is now in the deque `q` and has been visited. The next node in the deque, which is `ver`, is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ver` is printed, `q` contains `node` and `ver`, `vis[node]` is 1, `vis[ver]` is 1 if the first neighboring node `node` has not been visited. Otherwise, nothing changes.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
