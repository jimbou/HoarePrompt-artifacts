Postcondition: **All nodes in the graph have been visited, the deque `q` contains at least one node that has not been visited before, `ver` is assigned the value of the new leftmost node in the deque `q`, the leftmost node in the deque `q` which is `ver` has been printed, graph[ver] must have at least 3 nodes, node is the third node in the graph[ver], and all nodes in graph[ver] are marked as visited if they were not visited before, otherwise nothing changes, and this is printed: the value of `ver` (the new leftmost node in the deque `q`) followed by a space. Additionally, if the node was not visited before, it is now marked as visited. If the node was not visited before, the deque `q` now contains the node that was previously the second node in graph[ver]. If the node was not visited before, the node that was previously the third node in graph[ver] is now appended to the deque `q`. If the node was visited before, nothing changes.**
