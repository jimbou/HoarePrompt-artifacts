You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ver is a node in the graph, graph is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, and vis is a list or dictionary where vis[i] represents whether node i has been visited or not.
    q = deque()
    q.append(ver)
    vis[ver] = 1
    while len(q):
        ver = q.popleft()
        
        print(ver, end=' ')
        
        for node in graph[ver]:
            if not vis[node]:
                q.append(node)
                vis[node] = 1
        
    #State: All nodes in the graph have been visited, the deque `q` is empty, `ver` is assigned the value of the last node in the graph, the last node in the graph which is `ver` has been printed, graph[ver] must have all nodes visited, and all nodes in graph[ver] are marked as visited if they were not visited before, otherwise nothing changes, and this is printed: the value of `ver` (the last node in the graph) followed by a space. Additionally, if the node was not visited before, it is now marked as visited. If the node was not visited before, the deque `q` now contains the node that was previously the last node in graph[ver].

```

Return Postconditions: All nodes in the graph have been visited, the deque `q` is empty, `ver` is assigned the value of the last node in the graph, the last node in the graph which is `ver` has been printed, graph[ver] must have all nodes visited, and all nodes in graph[ver] are marked as visited if they were not visited before, otherwise nothing changes, and this is printed: the value of `ver` (the last node in the graph) followed by a space. Additionally, if the node was not visited before, it is now marked as visited. If the node was not visited before, the deque `q` now contains the node that was previously the last node in graph[ver].


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
