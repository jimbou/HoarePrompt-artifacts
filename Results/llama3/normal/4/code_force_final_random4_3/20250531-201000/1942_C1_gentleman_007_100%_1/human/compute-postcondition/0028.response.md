Output State: **All nodes in the graph have been visited, the deque `q` contains all nodes from the graph plus the node if it was not visited before, and the node that was the third node in the graph[ver], `ver` is assigned the value of the leftmost node in the deque `q`, the leftmost node in the deque `q` which is `ver` has been printed, graph[ver] must have at least 3 nodes, and the third node in the graph[ver] is marked as visited.**

The code snippet adds the third node in the graph[ver] to the deque `q` and marks it as visited. The rest of the state remains unchanged.
