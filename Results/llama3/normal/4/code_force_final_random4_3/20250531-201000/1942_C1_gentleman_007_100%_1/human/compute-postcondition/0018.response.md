The code prints the value of `ver`, which is the leftmost node in the deque `q`, followed by a space.
Since the deque `q` contains more than all nodes from the graph minus one node, and all nodes in the graph have been visited, the leftmost node in the deque `q` is the node that was visited first.
Output: **the leftmost node in the deque q (which is the first visited node in the graph)**
