The code prints the value of `ver`, which is the next node in the deque `q`, followed by a space. Since `ver` is the next node in the deque `q` and `q` contains nodes from the graph with one node removed from the left, `ver` is the node that was previously the second node in the deque `q` before the leftmost node was removed.

Output: **the next node in the deque q (which is the node that was previously the second node in the deque q)**
