Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are lists of elements of any type and value, and they are not empty, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, where `dp[i][j]` is the length of the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` ending at index `i - 1` in `a` and `j - 1` in `b`, for all `i` from 1 to `len(a)` and `j` from 1 to `len(b)`, `i` is `len(a)`, `j` is `len(b)`, and `l` is an empty list. Additionally, `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`***
