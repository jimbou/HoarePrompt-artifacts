# Problem:
[Proof Geometric Construction Can Solve All Love Affairs -
manbo-p](https://soundcloud.com/alice-law-314125270/manbo-p-proof-geometric-
construction-can-solve-all-love-affairs)

⠀

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a line of space-separated integers.
    return list(map(int, input().split()))

#Overall this is what the function does:The function creates and returns a list containing 'n' elements, all of which are the value 'v'. The function accepts two parameters: 'n', a non-negative integer representing the number of elements in the list, and 'v', a value of any type that will be used to populate the list. The function does not modify any external state or have any side effects beyond returning the newly created list.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers, v is a value of any type.

    #The program returns a 2D list (or matrix) with 'n' number of rows and 'm' number of columns, where each element in the list is the value 'v'.

#Overall this is what the function does:Creates a 2D list (or matrix) with a specified number of rows and columns, where every element is initialized with a given value. The function takes three parameters: the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), and the value to fill the matrix (v), and returns the constructed matrix.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function constructs and returns a list of n + 1 lists, where each list represents a bidirectional connection between two indices. The function accepts two parameters, n and m, where n is a positive integer and m is a non-negative integer such that m <= n. The function iterates m times, calling func_1() to obtain two indices, x and y, and appends these indices to each other's lists in the main list. The function returns the constructed list, where each list at index x contains y and each list at index y contains x, representing a bidirectional connection between the two indices.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates a 2D list 'l' of size (n+1) x (n+1) where 'n' is a positive integer, and sets 'l[x][y]', 'l[y][x]', 'l[x][x]', and 'l[y][y]' to 1 for 'm' number of pairs (x, y) obtained from function func_1(), while keeping all other elements as 0.

#Function 7:

    #The program returns a dictionary `d` where each key is an element from the list `l` and its corresponding value is the number of times that element appears in `l`.

#Overall this is what the function does:Counts the occurrences of each unique element in a list and returns a dictionary where each key is an element from the list and its corresponding value is the number of times that element appears in the list.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the cumulative sum of a 2D list of integers, returning a new 2D list where each element at position (i, j) represents the sum of all elements in the original list from the top-left corner to the cell at position (i-1, j-1). The function takes a 2D list of integers as input and returns a new 2D list with the cumulative sums, effectively transforming the input data into a new representation that facilitates range sum queries.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer
    return max(1 - (x & x - 1), 0)
    #The program returns the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of the integer x, or 0 if x is 0

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes an integer x as input and returns the number of trailing zeros in its binary representation. If x is 0, it returns 0.

    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of 0 and all integers in the list `l`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the greatest common divisor of 0 and all integers in the input list. Since the greatest common divisor of 0 and any number is always 0, the function effectively returns 0 for any input list of integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a list of all prime numbers from 2 to a given positive integer `num`. It initializes a boolean array `prime` of size `num + 1` to track prime numbers, and two integer arrays `Highest_Prime` and `Lowest_Prime` to store the highest and lowest prime factors of each number. It then iterates through the numbers from 2 to `num`, marking non-prime numbers and updating the prime factors. Finally, it constructs a list `p` of all prime numbers found and returns it.

    #The program returns a dictionary containing key-value pairs where the keys are prime factors of the original value of num (which is 1) and the values are the number of times each prime factor appears in the prime factorization of the original value of num (which is 1). Since 1 has no prime factors, the dictionary is empty.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a positive integer `num` and a list of integers `Prime_array` as input, where `Prime_array[i]` is a prime factor of `i+1` for all `i` in the range of `Prime_array`. It returns a dictionary containing the prime factors of the original value of `num` as keys and their respective counts in the prime factorization of `num` as values. If `num` is 1, the function returns an empty dictionary, as 1 has no prime factors.

Since n is 1, it has no prime factors, so the dictionary d is empty.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a positive integer n as input and returns a dictionary containing the prime factors of n and their respective counts. If n is a prime number greater than 1, it is also included in the dictionary with a count of 1. The function effectively performs prime factorization of the input number n.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates the product of the number of keys in a dictionary, the last key raised to the power of its value minus 1, and the last key minus 1, assuming the dictionary has at least one key and all values are integers greater than or equal to 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a list of integers based on a recursive formula, taking into account two parameters: `n` (a positive integer) and `mod` (an integer greater than or equal to -1). If `mod` is -1, the function calculates the list elements using the formula `(i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2])` for `i` ranging from 2 to `n`, and returns a list of length `n`. If `mod` is not -1, the function calculates the list elements using the formula `((k - 1) % mod * (dearr[k - 1] + dearr[k - 2]) % mod)` for all integers `k` such that 2 is less than or equal to `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, and returns a list of length `n + 1`. The first two elements of the list are always 1 and 0.

        #The program returns -1, which is an integer value.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function searches for the value `x` in a sorted list `p` and returns the index of `x` if found, or -1 if not found, maintaining the sorted order of the list.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a binary search on a sorted list of integers to find the index of the largest element that is less than or equal to a given integer. If the list is empty or the first element is greater than the given integer, it returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the index of the largest element that is less than or equal to the given integer, or the index of the first element that is greater than the given integer if no such element exists.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a binary search on a sorted list of distinct integers to find the index of the smallest element that is greater than or equal to a given integer. If the given integer is larger than the last element in the list, the function returns the length of the list. The function takes a sorted list of distinct integers and an integer as input and returns an index or the length of the list, depending on the relationship between the input integer and the list elements.
