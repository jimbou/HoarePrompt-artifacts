Output State: **All nodes in the graph have been visited, the deque `q` is empty, `ver` is assigned the value of the last node in the graph, the last node in the graph which is `ver` has been printed, graph[ver] must have all nodes visited, and all nodes in graph[ver] are marked as visited if they were not visited before, otherwise nothing changes, and this is printed: the value of `ver` (the last node in the graph) followed by a space. Additionally, if the node was not visited before, it is now marked as visited. If the node was not visited before, the deque `q` now contains the node that was previously the last node in graph[ver].**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, all nodes in the graph have been visited and marked as such. The deque `q` is empty, indicating that there are no more nodes to visit. The variable `ver` holds the value of the last node in the graph, which has been printed. The neighbors of this last node have all been visited and marked as such. If any of these neighbors were not visited before, they are now marked as visited. If any of these neighbors were not visited before, they are now added to the deque `q`.
