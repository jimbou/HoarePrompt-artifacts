This function generates a list of integers based on a recursive formula, taking into account two parameters: `n` (a positive integer) and `mod` (an integer greater than or equal to -1). If `mod` is -1, the function calculates the list elements using the formula `(i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2])` for `i` ranging from 2 to `n`, and returns a list of length `n`. If `mod` is not -1, the function calculates the list elements using the formula `((k - 1) % mod * (dearr[k - 1] + dearr[k - 2]) % mod)` for all integers `k` such that 2 is less than or equal to `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, and returns a list of length `n + 1`. The first two elements of the list are always 1 and 0.
