This function generates a list of all prime numbers from 2 to a given positive integer `num`. It initializes a boolean array `prime` of size `num + 1` to track prime numbers, and two integer arrays `Highest_Prime` and `Lowest_Prime` to store the highest and lowest prime factors of each number. It then iterates through the numbers from 2 to `num`, marking non-prime numbers and updating the prime factors. Finally, it constructs a list `p` of all prime numbers found and returns it.
