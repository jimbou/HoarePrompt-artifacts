This function calculates the cumulative sum of a 2D list of integers, returning a new 2D list where each element at position (i, j) represents the sum of all elements in the original list from the top-left corner to the cell at position (i-1, j-1). The function takes a 2D list of integers as input and returns a new 2D list with the cumulative sums, effectively transforming the input data into a new representation that facilitates range sum queries.
