Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists of elements of any type and value, and they are not empty, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, `i` is `len(a) + 1`, `j` is `len(b) + 1`. For all `j` from 1 to `len(b)`, if the last element of `a` is equal to the element at index `j - 1` in `b`, then `dp[len(a) + 1][j]` is `dp[len(a)][j - 1] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[len(a) + 1][j]` is the maximum of `dp[len(a) + 1][j - 1]` and `dp[len(a)][j]`.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the 2D list `dp` will contain the lengths of the longest common subsequences of `a` and `b` ending at each index in `a` and `b`. Specifically, for each index `j` in `b`, if the last element of `a` is equal to the element at index `j - 1` in `b`, then the length of the longest common subsequence ending at index `j` in `b` is one more than the length of the longest common subsequence ending at index `j - 1` in `b`. Otherwise, the length of the longest common subsequence ending at index `j` in `b` is the maximum of the lengths of the longest common subsequences ending at index `j - 1` in `b` and index `j` in `a`.
