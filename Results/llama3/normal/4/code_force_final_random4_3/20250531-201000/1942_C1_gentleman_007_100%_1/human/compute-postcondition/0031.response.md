The only variable in the loop head is the deque `q`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the deque `q`. If the length of `q` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `q` contains all nodes from the graph plus the nodes that were not visited before. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `q` must contain at least one more node that has not been visited before.

State: **All nodes in the graph have been visited, the deque `q` contains at least one more node that has not been visited before, `ver` is assigned the value of the leftmost node in the deque `q`, the leftmost node in the deque `q` which is `ver` has been printed, graph[ver] must have all nodes visited, and all nodes in graph[ver] are marked as visited if they were not visited before, otherwise nothing changes.**
