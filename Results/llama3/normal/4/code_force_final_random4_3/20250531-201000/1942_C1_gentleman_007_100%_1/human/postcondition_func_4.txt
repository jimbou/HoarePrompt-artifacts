The function constructs and returns a list of n + 1 lists, where each list represents a bidirectional connection between two indices. The function accepts two parameters, n and m, where n is a positive integer and m is a non-negative integer such that m <= n. The function iterates m times, calling func_1() to obtain two indices, x and y, and appends these indices to each other's lists in the main list. The function returns the constructed list, where each list at index x contains y and each list at index y contains x, representing a bidirectional connection between the two indices.
