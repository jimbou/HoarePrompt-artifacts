Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, ans is equal to n plus (n + 2) // 4 plus (n + 3) // 9, root is an integer equal to the square root of n plus 1 and at least 3, stdin contains one less test case, i is 3**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `i * i` to `cnt`, which is 9 since `i` is 3. The second line increments `ans` by the value of `(n + i) // cnt`, which is `(n + 3) // 9`. The value of `ans` is now `n plus (n + 2) // 4 plus (n + 3) // 9`. No other variables are affected.
