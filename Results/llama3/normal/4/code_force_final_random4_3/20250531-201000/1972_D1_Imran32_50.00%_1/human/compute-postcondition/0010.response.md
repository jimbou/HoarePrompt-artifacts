Functionality: **The function reads a test case from standard input, where the test case consists of two positive integers n and k. It calculates a value 'ans' by adding n to the sum of (n + i) // (i * i) for i ranging from 2 to the square root of n plus 1. The function then prints the calculated value 'ans'. The function does not modify the input variables n and k, and it does not have any side effects other than printing the result. The function's purpose is to compute and output a specific mathematical expression based on the input values n and k.**
