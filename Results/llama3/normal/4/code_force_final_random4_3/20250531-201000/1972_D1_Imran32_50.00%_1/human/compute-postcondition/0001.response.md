To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `root`. The loop will execute if `root` is at least 3 (since the range starts from 2 and goes up to `root + 1`). Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `root` to be at least 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `ans` is equal to `n`, `root` is an integer equal to the square root of `n` plus 1 and at least 3, `stdin` contains one less test case, `i` is 2**
