The code prints the value of `ans`, which is equal to `n` plus the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for `i` from 2 to `root`. Here, `root` is an integer equal to the square root of `n` plus 1, and `i` is equal to `root + 1`.

Since `i` is equal to `root + 1`, the loop that calculates the sum only runs until `root`, not including `i`. Therefore, the sum is calculated for `i` from 2 to `root`.

The value of `ans` is the sum of `n` and the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for `i` from 2 to `root`. This sum is calculated using integer division (`//`), which means that the result is an integer.

Output: **n + sum of (n + i) // (i * i) for i from 2 to root (where n is a positive integer, root is the square root of n plus 1, and i is equal to root + 1)**
