Output: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, ans is equal to n plus the sum of (n + i) // (i * i) for i from 2 to root, root is an integer equal to the square root of n plus 1, stdin contains one less test case, i is equal to root + 1, and ans is printed, where ans is equal to n plus the sum of (n + i) // (i * i) for i from 2 to root**
