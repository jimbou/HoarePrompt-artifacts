Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, ans is equal to n plus the sum of (n + i) // (i * i) for i from 2 to root, root is an integer equal to the square root of n plus 1, stdin contains one less test case, i is equal to root + 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable 'n' and 'k' remain unchanged as positive integers, the variable 'ans' is updated to be the sum of the initial value of 'n' and the sum of the expressions '(n + i) // (i * i)' for 'i' ranging from 2 to the value of 'root', the variable 'root' remains unchanged as the integer equal to the square root of 'n' plus 1, the standard input 'stdin' contains one less test case, and the loop variable 'i' is equal to 'root + 1'.
