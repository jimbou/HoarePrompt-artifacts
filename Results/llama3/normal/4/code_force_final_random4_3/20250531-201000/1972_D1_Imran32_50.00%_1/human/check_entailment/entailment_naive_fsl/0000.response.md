Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem asks to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m;
* a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

However, the program does not correctly implement this logic. The function `func_1` does not use the variable `k` (which is supposed to be `m`) at all, and the logic inside the function does not match the problem description.

For example, when `n = 3` and `m = 5`, the correct output should be `4` (the pairs are (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 2), and (3, 3)), but the program outputs `5`, which is incorrect.

The program seems to be trying to solve a different problem, and it does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem.
