Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
* a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

However, the program has several issues:

1. The function `func_1()` is not correctly implemented. It seems to be trying to count the number of pairs (a, b) where a + b is a multiple of a * b, not b * gcd(a, b). This is not the correct condition.
2. The program is not using the variable `k` (which is supposed to be `m`) anywhere in the calculation.
3. The program is not correctly calculating the number of pairs. The formula `(n + i) // cnt` is not correct.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b`, calculate the gcd of `a` and `b`, and check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. We can use the `math.gcd()` function to calculate the gcd.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
import math

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            gcd = math.gcd(a, b)
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd) == 0:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```
This program correctly calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions.

Correctness: **False**
