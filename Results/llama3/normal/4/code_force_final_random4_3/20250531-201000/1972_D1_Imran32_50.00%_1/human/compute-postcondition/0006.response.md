Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, ans is equal to n plus (n + 2) // 4 plus (n + 3) // 9 plus (n + 4) // 16, root is an integer equal to the square root of n plus 1 and at least 3, stdin contains one less test case, i is 4**

The code block modifies the value of `ans` by adding `(n + i) // cnt` to it. Since `i` is 4, `cnt` becomes 16 (4 * 4). The expression `(n + i) // cnt` evaluates to `(n + 4) // 16`. This value is added to the initial value of `ans`, which was `n plus (n + 2) // 4 plus (n + 3) // 9`. The resulting value of `ans` is `n plus (n + 2) // 4 plus (n + 3) // 9 plus (n + 4) // 16`. No other variables are affected by the code.
