Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, ans is equal to n plus (n + 2) // 4, root is an integer equal to the square root of n plus 1 and at least 3, stdin contains one less test case, i is 2**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding the result of the expression `(n + i) // cnt` to its initial value, which was equal to `n`. The expression `(n + i) // cnt` is evaluated as `(n + 2) // 4` since `i` is 2 and `cnt` is `i * i`, which is 4. The other variables, `n`, `k`, `root`, and `i`, remain unchanged, and `stdin` still contains one less test case.
