The code prints the value of the expression `p1 - cur + p3`. 

Here, `p1` and `p3` are integers from the input, and `cur` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive).

Since the exact values of `p1`, `p3`, and `cur` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the expression `p1 - cur + p3`.

Output: **p1 - cur + p3 (where p1 and p3 are integers from the input and cur is an integer between 1 and 498)**
