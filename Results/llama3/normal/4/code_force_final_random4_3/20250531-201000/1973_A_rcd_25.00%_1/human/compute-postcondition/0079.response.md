Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers from the input, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, the sum of `p1 - cur` and `p3` is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `stdin` contains the remaining test cases minus two.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that we have printed the sum of `p1 - cur` and `p3`, and we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain the same, and the only change is that we have exited the loop or if statement and printed the desired sum.
