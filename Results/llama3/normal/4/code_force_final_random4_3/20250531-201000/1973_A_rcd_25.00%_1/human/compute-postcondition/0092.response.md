Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers from the input, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` and `high` must be greater than or equal to 1, `cur` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The values of `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`, and `cur` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
