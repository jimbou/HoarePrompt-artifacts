The code prints the sum of `p1` and `p3`, minus the value of `cur`. 

Since `cur` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, it is also the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. 

Therefore, the expression `p1 - cur + p3` can be simplified to `p1 + p3 - (p3 - p1)` or `p1 + p3 - (p3 - p2)`. 

This simplifies further to `2*p1` or `p1 + p2`. 

However, since `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, we can conclude that `p1 + p2` is less than or equal to `2*p1`. 

Therefore, the expression `p1 - cur + p3` will evaluate to `p1 + p2`.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 and p2 are integers such that p3 - p1 and p3 - p2 are both non-negative)**
