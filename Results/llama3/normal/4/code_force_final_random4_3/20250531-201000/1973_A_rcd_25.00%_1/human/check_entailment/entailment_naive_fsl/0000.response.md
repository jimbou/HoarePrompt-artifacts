Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the total number of points is not a multiple of 2. In this case, the program should print -1, but it does not. For example, if the input is 1 1 3, the program will print 2, but the correct output should be -1.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case when p3 is less than p1 + p2. In this case, the program should print -1, but it does not. For example, if the input is 2 2 3, the program will print 4, but the correct output should be -1.

The program also does not correctly handle the case when p1 is greater than p2. In this case, the program should print -1, but it does not. For example, if the input is 2 1 3, the program will print 4, but the correct output should be -1.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
