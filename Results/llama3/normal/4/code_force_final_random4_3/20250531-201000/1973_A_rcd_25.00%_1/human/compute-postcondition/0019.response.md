Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 499 (inclusive), _ is 0, p1, p2, p3 are integers, low is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2 and high must be greater than or equal to cur, cur is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2 + 1, stdin contains the remaining test cases, and p1 - cur is greater than p2 - (p3 - cur)**

In this output state, the value of cur has been incremented by 1, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged. The relationship between the variables, such as the minimum and maximum values, and the inequality between p1, p2, and cur, are still valid.
