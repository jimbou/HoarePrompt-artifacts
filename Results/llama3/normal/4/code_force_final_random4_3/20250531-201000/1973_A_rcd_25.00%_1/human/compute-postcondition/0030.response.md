Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` and `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code snippet only contains a `break` statement, which means it will exit the current loop or if statement. The values of the variables `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged. The condition `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 2` is still valid. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
