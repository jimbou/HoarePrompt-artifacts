Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum possible number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three players, based on their final scores. The program handles all possible cases, including when the total score is odd, when the third player's score is greater than or equal to the sum of the first two players' scores, and when the third player's score is less than the sum of the first two players' scores. The program also correctly prints -1 when the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games and results.

Correctness: **True**
