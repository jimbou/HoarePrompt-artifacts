Based on the precondition, the code `print(-1)` will print the value -1.

The variables `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not used in the print statement, so their values do not affect the output.

The fact that `t` is an integer between 0 and 499 (inclusive) and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an odd number is irrelevant to the print statement.

The value of `_` is 0, but it is not used in the print statement.

The remaining test cases in stdin are also not relevant to the print statement.

Therefore, the output will simply be the value -1.

Output: **-1**
