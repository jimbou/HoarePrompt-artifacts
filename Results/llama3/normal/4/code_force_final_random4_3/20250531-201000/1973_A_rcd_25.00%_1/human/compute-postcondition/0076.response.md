Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers from the input, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. The current value of `cur` is such that `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`. `stdin` contains the remaining test cases minus two***
