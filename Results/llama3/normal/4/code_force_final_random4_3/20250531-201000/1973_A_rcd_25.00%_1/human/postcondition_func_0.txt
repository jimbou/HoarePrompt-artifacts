This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers representing the scores of three players. It then determines and prints the maximum possible score that can be achieved by the first two players, considering the rules that the total score must be even and the third player's score must be greater than or equal to the sum of the first two players' scores. If the total score is odd or the third player's score is less than the sum of the first two players' scores, it prints -1. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input stream empty.
