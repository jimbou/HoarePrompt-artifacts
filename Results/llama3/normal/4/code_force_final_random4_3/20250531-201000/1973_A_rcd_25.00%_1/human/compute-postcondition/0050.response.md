Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers such that `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are both non-negative, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` plus 1, `stdin` contains the remaining test cases minus one, and `p1 - cur` is more than `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, and `p1 - cur` is more than `p2 - (p3 - cur)` is not valid anymore because cur has been increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still an integer between 0 and 498, `_` is still 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are still integers such that `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are both non-negative, `low` and `high` are still the minimum and maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` respectively, `cur` is now the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` plus 1, there is still one less test case in `stdin`, and the condition `p1 - cur` is more than `p2 - (p3 - cur)` is no longer valid because `cur` has been increased by 1.
