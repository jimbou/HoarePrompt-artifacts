The code prints the value of `p1` minus the current value `cur` plus the value of `p3`. 

Since `cur` is increased by 1, the value of `cur` is `cur + 1`. 

`p1` and `p3` are integers such that `p3 - p1` is non-negative, meaning `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1`.

Output: **p1 - (cur + 1) + p3 (where p1 and p3 are integers such that p3 is greater than or equal to p1, and cur is an integer between 0 and 498 inclusive)**
