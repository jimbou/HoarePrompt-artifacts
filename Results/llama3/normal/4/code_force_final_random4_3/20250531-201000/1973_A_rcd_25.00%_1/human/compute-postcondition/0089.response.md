The variables in the loop head are high and cur, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables high and cur. If high is greater than or equal to cur, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, high is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and cur is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, high must be greater than or equal to cur, so high must be greater than or equal to the minimum value of cur, which is 1. Therefore, high must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers from the input, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` and `high` must be greater than or equal to 1, `cur` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive)**
