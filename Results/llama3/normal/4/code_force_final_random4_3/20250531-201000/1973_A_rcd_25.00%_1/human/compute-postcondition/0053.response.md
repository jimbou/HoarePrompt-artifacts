The code prints the value of the expression `p1 - cur + p3`. To understand what this expression evaluates to, we need to consider the given precondition.

The precondition states that `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are both non-negative. This implies that `p3` is greater than or equal to both `p1` and `p2`.

The variable `cur` is not explicitly defined in the precondition, but it is mentioned that `high` is greater than `cur`. However, the value of `cur` is not directly relevant to the expression `p1 - cur + p3`, as `cur` is not used in this expression.

The expression `p1 - cur + p3` can be rewritten as `(p1 + p3) - cur`. Since `cur` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can describe the value of the expression in terms of the given variables.

The value of `p1 + p3` is the sum of two integers, `p1` and `p3`, where `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1`. This sum is an integer value.

The value of `cur` is unknown, but it is subtracted from the sum `p1 + p3`. Therefore, the final result of the expression `p1 - cur + p3` is the difference between the sum `p1 + p3` and the unknown value `cur`.

Output: **(p1 + p3) - cur (where p1 and p3 are integers such that p3 is greater than or equal to p1, and cur is an unknown value)**
