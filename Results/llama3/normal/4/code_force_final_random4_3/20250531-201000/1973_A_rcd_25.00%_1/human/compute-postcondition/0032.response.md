Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 499 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 3` and `cur` is increased by 1.***
