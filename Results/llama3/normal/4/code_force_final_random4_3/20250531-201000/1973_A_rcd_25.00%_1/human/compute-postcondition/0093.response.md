Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers from the input, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` and `high` must be greater than or equal to 1, `cur` is an integer between 2 and 499 (inclusive)**

The code increments the value of `cur` by 1, so the new value of `cur` is between 2 and 499 (inclusive). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
