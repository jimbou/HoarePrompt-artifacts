Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers such that `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are both non-negative, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, then `cur` is increased by 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `p1 - cur + p3` has been printed. Otherwise, `cur` is increased by 1 and `high` is greater than or equal to `cur + 2`.***
