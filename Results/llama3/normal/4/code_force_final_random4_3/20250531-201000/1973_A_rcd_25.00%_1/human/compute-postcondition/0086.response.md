Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers from the input, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is less than `high`, `stdin` contains the remaining test cases minus three, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`, and `cur` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the number of remaining test cases in `stdin` decreases by one.
