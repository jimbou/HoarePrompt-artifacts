The variables in the loop head are `high` and `cur`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `high` and `cur`. If `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 0 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers such that `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are both non-negative, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. `high` being the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `high` is greater than `cur`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers such that `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are both non-negative, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is greater than `cur`**
