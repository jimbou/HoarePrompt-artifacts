The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 0 and 498 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers, stdin contains the remaining test cases minus one.**
