Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 498 (inclusive), _ is 1, p1, p2, p3 are integers, low is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, cur is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, stdin contains the remaining test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code introduces two new variables, `low` and `high`, which are assigned the minimum and maximum values of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, respectively. Additionally, a new variable `cur` is introduced and assigned the same value as `low`. The state of `stdin` remains the same, containing the remaining test cases minus one.
