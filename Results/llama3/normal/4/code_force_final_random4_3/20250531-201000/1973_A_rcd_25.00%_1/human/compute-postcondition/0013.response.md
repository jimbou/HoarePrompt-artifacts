To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `high >= cur` and adjust the states of `high` and `cur` accordingly.

Given that `cur` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, we can infer that `cur` is always less than or equal to `high`.

However, to guarantee that the loop executes at least once, we need to ensure that `high` is indeed greater than or equal to `cur`. Since `cur` is already the minimum of the two differences, we can't adjust `cur` to be smaller.

Therefore, we need to adjust `high` to be greater than or equal to `cur`. This means that the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` should be greater than or equal to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

In other words, we need to ensure that the difference between `p3` and `p1` (or `p2`) is not negative, so that the maximum of these differences is not less than the minimum.

State: **t is an integer between 0 and 499 (inclusive), _ is 0, p1, p2, p3 are integers, low is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2 and high must be greater than or equal to cur, cur is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, stdin contains the remaining test cases.**
