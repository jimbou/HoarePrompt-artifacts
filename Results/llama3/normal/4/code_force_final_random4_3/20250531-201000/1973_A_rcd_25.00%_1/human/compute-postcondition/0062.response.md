Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers such that `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are both non-negative, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is greater than or equal to `cur + 2` and `cur` is increased by 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cur` has been increased by 1, and the value of `high` is now greater than or equal to `cur + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
