Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 499 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers, stdin contains the remaining test cases. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an odd number, -1 is printed and we move on to the next test case. Otherwise, no action is taken. Additionally, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.***
