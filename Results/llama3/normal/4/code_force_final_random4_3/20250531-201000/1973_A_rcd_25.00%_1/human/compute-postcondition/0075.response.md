To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `high >= cur` and adjust the states of `high` and `cur` accordingly.

Given the initial states:

* `t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive)
* `_` is 2
* `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers from the input
* `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`
* `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`
* `cur` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`
* `stdin` contains the remaining test cases minus two

Since `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, we can conclude that `high` is always greater than or equal to `cur`.

However, to ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to guarantee that `high` is indeed greater than or equal to `cur`. This is already the case, as `high` is defined as the maximum of the two values, and `cur` is defined as the minimum.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states of `high` and `cur`. The program state right before the loop can remain the same.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers from the input, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `stdin` contains the remaining test cases minus two**
