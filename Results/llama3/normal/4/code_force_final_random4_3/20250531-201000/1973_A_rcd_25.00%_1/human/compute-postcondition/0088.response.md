Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers from the input, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, then `cur` is less than `high` and `stdin` contains the remaining test cases minus three, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is less than or equal to `high` and `stdin` contains the remaining test cases minus two.***
