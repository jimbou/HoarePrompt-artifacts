Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains the remaining test cases.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
    if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
        print(-1)
        continue
    if p3 >= p1 + p2:
        print(p1 + p2)
    else:
        low, high = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)
        cur = low
        while high >= cur:
            if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                print(p1 - cur + p3)
                break
            else:
                cur += 1
        else:
            print(p3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 499 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers, stdin contains the remaining test cases. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an odd number, -1 is printed and we move on to the next test case. Otherwise, if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. Otherwise, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers, stdin contains the remaining test cases minus one. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, -1 is printed and the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped, moving on to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statements. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. Otherwise, `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are both non-negative, and the program enters a loop where `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` plus the number of iterations of the loop. If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, then `p1 - cur + p3` has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `high` is less than `cur`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers from the input, stdin contains the remaining test cases minus two. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, -1 is printed and the rest of the current iteration is skipped, moving to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. Otherwise, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
