According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `high` and `cur`. If `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `high` is greater than or equal to `cur + 1`, and `cur` is an integer between 0 and 499 (inclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 1`, which is already the case. However, since `cur` is increased by 1 in the loop body, we need to ensure that `high` is still greater than or equal to the new value of `cur`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `high` to be greater than or equal to `cur + 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` and `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 2`.**
