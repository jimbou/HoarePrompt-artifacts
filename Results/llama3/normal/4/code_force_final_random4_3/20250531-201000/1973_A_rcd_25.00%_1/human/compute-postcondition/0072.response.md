The code prints the sum of `p1` and `p2`, which are integers from the input. Since the exact values of `p1` and `p2` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the sum. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 and p2 are integers from the input)**
