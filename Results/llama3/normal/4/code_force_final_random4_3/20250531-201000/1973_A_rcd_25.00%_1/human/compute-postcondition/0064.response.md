Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 498 (inclusive), _ is 1, p1, p2, p3 are integers such that p3 - p1 and p3 - p2 are both non-negative, low is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, cur is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2 plus the number of iterations of the loop, stdin contains the remaining test cases minus the number of iterations of the loop. If p1 - cur is less than or equal to p2 - (p3 - cur), then p1 - cur + p3 has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, high is less than cur.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations. The values of `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body. The value of `cur` has been increased by the number of iterations of the loop, and the value of `stdin` has been decreased by the number of iterations of the loop. If the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is true, then the value of `p1 - cur + p3` has been printed and the loop has been exited. Otherwise, the value of `high` is less than `cur`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
