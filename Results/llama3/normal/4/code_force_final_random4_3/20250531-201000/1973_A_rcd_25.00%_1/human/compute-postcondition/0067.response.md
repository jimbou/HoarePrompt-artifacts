Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers from the input, stdin contains the remaining test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are now integers obtained from the input, which was a space-separated list of integers. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains one less test case than before, as one test case has been processed.
