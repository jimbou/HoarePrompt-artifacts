The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and the first line contains the number of test cases `t` (1 <= t <= 500). Therefore, `t` is assigned an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and the stdin now contains the remaining test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains the remaining test cases.**
