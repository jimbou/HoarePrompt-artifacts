Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers, stdin contains the remaining test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decremented by 1 because one test case has been processed. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` have been assigned the values of the next three integers from the input. The value of `_` remains unchanged. The stdin now contains one less test case.
