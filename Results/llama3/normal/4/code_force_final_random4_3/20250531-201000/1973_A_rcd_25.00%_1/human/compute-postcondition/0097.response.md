Output State: **`t` is 0, `_` is the initial value of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers from the input, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The variable `_` will hold the initial value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will hold the values of the last test case. The standard input `stdin` will be empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
