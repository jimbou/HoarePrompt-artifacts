The variables in the loop head are `high` and `cur`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `high` and `cur`. If `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. Since `cur` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, it is less than or equal to `high`. However, we need to ensure that `high` is greater than `cur` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, `cur` needs to be adjusted to be less than `high`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers from the input, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is less than `high`, `stdin` contains the remaining test cases minus two**
