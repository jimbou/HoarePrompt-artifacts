According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `high` and `cur`. If `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `high` is greater than `cur + 1` and `cur` is increased by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 1` and `cur` must be increased by 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers such that `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are both non-negative, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is greater than or equal to `cur + 1` and `cur` is increased by 1**
