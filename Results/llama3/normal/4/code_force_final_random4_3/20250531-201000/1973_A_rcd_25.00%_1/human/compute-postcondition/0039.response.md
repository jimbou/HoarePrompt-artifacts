Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers, stdin contains the remaining test cases minus one, and -1 is being printed, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains the remaining test cases minus one, and -1 is still being printed. The only change is that we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration due to the `continue` statement.
