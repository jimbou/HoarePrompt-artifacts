Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 0 and 499 (inclusive), _ is 0, p1, p2, p3 are integers, low is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2 and high must be greater than or equal to cur. If p1 - cur is less than or equal to p2 - (p3 - cur), then the value of p1 - cur + p3 is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, cur is incremented by 1.***
