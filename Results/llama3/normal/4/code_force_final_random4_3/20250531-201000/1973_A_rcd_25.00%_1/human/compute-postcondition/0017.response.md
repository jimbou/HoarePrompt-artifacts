Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 499 (inclusive), _ is 0, p1, p2, p3 are integers, low is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2 and high must be greater than or equal to cur, cur is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, stdin contains the remaining test cases. The current value of p1 minus cur is less than or equal to the current value of p2 minus the difference of p3 and cur, and this is printed: p1 - cur + p3 (where p1, p2, p3, and cur are the current values of p1, p2, p3, and cur, respectively) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables t, _, p1, p2, p3, low, high, and cur remain the same, and the condition that the current value of p1 minus cur is less than or equal to the current value of p2 minus the difference of p3 and cur is still true. The expression p1 - cur + p3 has been printed.
