Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers from the input, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is less than `high`, `stdin` contains the remaining test cases minus two, and this is printed: `p1 - cur + p3` which is the value of `p1` minus the value of `cur` plus the value of `p3`**
