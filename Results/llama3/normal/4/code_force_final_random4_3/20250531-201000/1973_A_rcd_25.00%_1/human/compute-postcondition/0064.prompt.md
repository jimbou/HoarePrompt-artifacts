Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 0 and 498 (inclusive), _ is 1, p1, p2, p3 are integers, low is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, cur is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, stdin contains the remaining test cases minus one.
Code of the loop:
while high >= cur:
    if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
        print(p1 - cur + p3)
        break
    else:
        cur += 1
else:
    print(p3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers such that `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are both non-negative, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, then `stdin` contains the remaining test cases minus two, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` plus 1, `stdin` contains the remaining test cases minus one, and `p1 - cur` is more than `p2 - (p3 - cur)` is not valid anymore because `cur` has been increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers such that `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are both non-negative, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `high` is greater than `cur + 1` and `cur` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers such that `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are both non-negative, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, then `cur` is increased by 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `p1 - cur + p3` has been printed. Otherwise, `cur` is increased by 1 and `high` is greater than or equal to `cur + 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
