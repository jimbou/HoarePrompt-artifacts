Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` and `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 3`, `cur` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, and the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `high` and `cur` is updated to reflect the new value of `cur`.
