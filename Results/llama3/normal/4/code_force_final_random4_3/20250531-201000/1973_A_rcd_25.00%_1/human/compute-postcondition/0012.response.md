Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 499 (inclusive), _ is 0, p1, p2, p3 are integers, low is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, cur is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, stdin contains the remaining test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code introduces three new variables: `low`, `high`, and `cur`. The value of `low` is set to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, while the value of `high` is set to the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. The value of `cur` is set to the same value as `low`, which is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged as the code does not interact with it.
