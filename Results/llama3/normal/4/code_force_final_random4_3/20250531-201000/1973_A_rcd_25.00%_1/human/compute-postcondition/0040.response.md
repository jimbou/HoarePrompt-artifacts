Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers, stdin contains the remaining test cases minus one. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, -1 is printed and the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped, moving on to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statements.***
