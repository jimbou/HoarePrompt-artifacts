Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers from the input, stdin contains the remaining test cases minus two, and -1 is being printed, and we skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains the remaining test cases minus two. Additionally, -1 is still being printed. The only change is that we skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement.
