Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers from the input, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` plus 1, `stdin` contains the remaining test cases minus two, and `p1 - cur` is greater than `p2 - (p3 - cur)`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `p1`, `p2`, and `cur` still holds, and the input and test cases remain the same.
