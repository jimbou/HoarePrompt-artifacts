Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers such that `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are both non-negative, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, then `stdin` contains the remaining test cases minus two, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` plus 1, `stdin` contains the remaining test cases minus one, and `p1 - cur` is more than `p2 - (p3 - cur)` is not valid anymore because `cur` has been increased by 1.***
