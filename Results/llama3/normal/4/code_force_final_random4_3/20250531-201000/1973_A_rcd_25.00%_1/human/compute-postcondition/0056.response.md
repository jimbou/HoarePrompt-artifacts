Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers such that `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are both non-negative, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is increased by 1**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `high` and `cur` is still valid, with `high` being greater than the new value of `cur`.
