Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers from the input, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `stdin` contains the remaining test cases minus two.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has finished executing, and the value of `cur` has reached the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. This indicates that the loop has iterated until `cur` is no longer less than `high`, and the loop condition `high >= cur` is no longer true. The other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
