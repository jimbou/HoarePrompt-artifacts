Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers, stdin contains the remaining test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is decreased by 1 because one test case has been processed. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are assigned the three integers from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The value of `_` remains unchanged. The stdin contains the remaining test cases.
