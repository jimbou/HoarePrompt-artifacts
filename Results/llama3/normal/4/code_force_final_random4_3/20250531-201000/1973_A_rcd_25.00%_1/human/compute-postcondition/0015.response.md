The code prints the sum of the value of `p1` minus `cur` and the value of `p3`. Since `cur` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, we can infer that `p1 - cur` is equal to the difference between `p1` and the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. Similarly, `p3` is a constant value.

Output: **p1 - (minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2) + p3**
