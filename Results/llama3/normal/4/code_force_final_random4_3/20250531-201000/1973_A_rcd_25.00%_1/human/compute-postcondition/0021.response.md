To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `high` and `cur`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`. At the end of the last iteration, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is an integer between 0 and 499 (inclusive).

To guarantee that the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that `high` is greater than or equal to `cur + 1`, since `cur` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `high` to be greater than or equal to `cur + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` and `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 1`**
