Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), _ is 2, p1, p2, p3 are integers from the input, low is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, cur is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, stdin contains the remaining test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code only introduces new variables `low`, `high`, and `cur`, which are calculated based on the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The value of `low` is the minimum difference between `p3` and either `p1` or `p2`, while the value of `high` is the maximum difference. The value of `cur` is initialized to the same value as `low`. The state of `stdin` also remains unchanged, containing the remaining test cases minus two.
