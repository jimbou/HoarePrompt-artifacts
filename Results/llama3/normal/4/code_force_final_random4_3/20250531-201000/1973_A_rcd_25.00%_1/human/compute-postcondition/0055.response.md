Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers such that `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are both non-negative, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is greater than `cur`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code only contains a `break` statement, which means it will exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently in. This does not change the values of any variables, but it does change the control flow of the program. The values of `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and `high` remain the same, and the relationship between `high` and `cur` is still valid. The only change is that the program will now continue executing outside of the loop or conditional statement it was in.
