The code prints the value of `p1 - cur + p3`, where `p1`, `p3` are integers from the input and `cur` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive).
Output: ** `t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers from the input, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` and `high` must be greater than or equal to 1, `cur` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), and this is printed: `p1 - cur + p3`**
