According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `high` and `cur`. If `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. Since `high` is the maximum and `cur` is the minimum, it is possible that `high` is less than `cur`, which would prevent the loop from executing.

To ensure that the loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the state of `high` and `cur` so that `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`. This can be achieved by making `high` greater than or equal to `cur`, or by making `cur` less than or equal to `high`.

Since `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, we can adjust the state of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` to ensure that `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`.

One possible adjustment is to make `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` both non-negative, so that `high` is non-negative and `cur` is non-negative. This would ensure that `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`, allowing the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers such that `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are both non-negative, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `stdin` contains the remaining test cases minus one**
