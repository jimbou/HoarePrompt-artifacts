Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program first checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the program prints -1 and moves on to the next test case. This is correct because the sum of the scores must be even, as each game contributes either 2 or 0 points to the total sum.

2.  If the sum of the scores is even, the program checks if the highest score is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores. If it is, the program prints the sum of the other two scores. This is correct because in this case, the maximum number of draws is achieved when the player with the highest score wins all their games against the other two players, and the other two players draw all their games against each other.

3.  If the highest score is not greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores, the program calculates the maximum number of draws by iterating over the possible number of draws between the player with the highest score and the player with the lowest score. The program prints the maximum number of draws that results in a valid set of scores. This is correct because the maximum number of draws is achieved when the player with the highest score draws as many games as possible against the player with the lowest score, and the other two players draw all their games against each other.

4.  If no valid set of scores is found, the program prints the highest score. This is correct because in this case, the maximum number of draws is achieved when the player with the highest score wins all their games against the other two players.

Correctness: **True**
