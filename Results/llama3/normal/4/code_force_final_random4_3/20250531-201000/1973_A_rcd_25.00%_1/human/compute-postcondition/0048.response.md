Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers such that `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are both non-negative, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `stdin` contains the remaining test cases minus two, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`, and `cur` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains one less test case. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
