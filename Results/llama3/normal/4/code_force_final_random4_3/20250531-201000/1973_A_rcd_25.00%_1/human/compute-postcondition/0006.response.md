The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. Since we are already inside a loop, the values of the variables are not affected. However, we move on to the next test case. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is still an odd number, and -1 is still being printed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers, stdin contains the remaining test cases, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an odd number, -1 is being printed, and we move on to the next test case.**
