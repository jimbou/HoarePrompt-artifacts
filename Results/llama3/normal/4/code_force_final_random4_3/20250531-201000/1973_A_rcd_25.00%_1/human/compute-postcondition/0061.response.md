Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers such that `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are both non-negative, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is greater than or equal to `cur + 1` and `cur` is increased by 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `p1 - cur + p3` has been printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and `high` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `cur` has been increased by 1. We have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, the expression `p1 - cur + p3` has been printed.
