The code prints the sum of `p1` minus `cur` and `p3`. Here, `p1` is an integer from the input, `cur` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` where `p2` and `p3` are integers from the input, and `p3` is an integer from the input.

Output: **p1 - (minimum of (p3 - p1) and (p3 - p2)) + p3 (where p1, p2, and p3 are integers from the input)**
