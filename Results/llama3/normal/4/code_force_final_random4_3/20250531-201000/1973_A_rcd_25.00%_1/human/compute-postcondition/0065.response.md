Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers, stdin contains the remaining test cases minus one. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, -1 is printed and the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped, moving on to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statements. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. Otherwise, `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are both non-negative, and the program enters a loop where `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` plus the number of iterations of the loop. If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, then `p1 - cur + p3` has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `high` is less than `cur`.***
