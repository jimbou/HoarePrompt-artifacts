Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 499 (inclusive), _ is 0, p1, p2, p3 are integers, low is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, cur is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, stdin contains the remaining test cases.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `cur` is equal to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. This means that the loop has iterated until `cur` has reached the minimum difference between `p3` and either `p1` or `p2`. The values of `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body. The value of `stdin` also remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the loop.
