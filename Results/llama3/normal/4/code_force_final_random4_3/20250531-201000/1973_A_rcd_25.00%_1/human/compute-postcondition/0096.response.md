Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers from the input, stdin contains the remaining test cases minus two. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, -1 is printed and the rest of the current iteration is skipped, moving to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. Otherwise, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.***
