Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers from the input, stdin contains the remaining test cases minus two. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, -1 is printed and the rest of the current iteration is skipped, moving to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
