Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers from the input, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is less than or equal to `high`, `stdin` contains the remaining test cases minus two**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, but it is still less than or equal to `high`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
