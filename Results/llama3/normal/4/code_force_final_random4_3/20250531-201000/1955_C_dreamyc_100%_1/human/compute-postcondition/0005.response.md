Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k/2, b is the floor of k/2, ans is 0, s_a is the value of the first element in nums, s_b is the value of the last element in nums, i is 0**

The code snippet modifies the values of `s_a` and `s_b` by adding the first and last elements of the `nums` list to them, respectively. The value of `i` remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial values.
