Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k/2, b is the floor of k/2, s_a is the sum of the first three elements in nums, s_b is the sum of the last three elements in nums, i is 2**

The code adds the third element of the list `nums` to `s_a` and the third last element of `nums` to `s_b`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as 2. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by the code.
