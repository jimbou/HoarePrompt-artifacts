Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers, `a` is the ceiling of `k/2`, `b` is the floor of `k/2`, `s_a` is the value of the first two elements in `nums`, `s_b` is the value of the last two elements in `nums`, `i` is 1, and `ans` is either 2, 3, or 4 depending on the initial values of `s_a`, `s_b`, `a`, and `b` if `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`, otherwise `ans` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. If `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`, the value of `ans` can be 2, 3, or 4, depending on the initial values of `s_a`, `s_b`, `a`, and `b`. Otherwise, the value of `ans` is increased by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
