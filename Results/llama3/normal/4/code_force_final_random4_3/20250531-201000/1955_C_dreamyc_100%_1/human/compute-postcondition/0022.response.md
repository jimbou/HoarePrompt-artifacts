Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers, `a` is the ceiling of `k/2`, `b` is the floor of `k/2`, `s_a` is the sum of the first three elements in `nums`, `s_b` is the sum of the last three elements in `nums`, `i` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is increased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is still a positive integer, `nums` is still a list of `n` positive integers, `a` is still the ceiling of `k/2`, `b` is still the floor of `k/2`, `s_a` is still the sum of the first three elements in `nums`, `s_b` is still the sum of the last three elements in `nums`, and `i` is still 2.
