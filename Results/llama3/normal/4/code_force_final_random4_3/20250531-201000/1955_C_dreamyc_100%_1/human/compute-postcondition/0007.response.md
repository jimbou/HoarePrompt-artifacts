Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers, `a` is the ceiling of `k/2`, `b` is the floor of `k/2`, `ans` is 1, `s_a` is the value of the first element in `nums`, `s_b` is the value of the last element in `nums`, `i` is 0. The current value of `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `s_a` and `a` are still valid.
