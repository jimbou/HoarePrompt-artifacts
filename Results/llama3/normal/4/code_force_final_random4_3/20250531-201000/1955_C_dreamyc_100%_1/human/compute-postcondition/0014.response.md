Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers, `a` is the ceiling of `k/2`, `b` is the floor of `k/2`, `s_a` is the value of the first two elements in `nums`, `s_b` is the value of the last two elements in `nums`, `i` is 1, `ans` is either 1, 2, or 3 depending on the initial values of `s_a`, `s_b`, `a`, and `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, and its new value depends on the initial values of `s_a`, `s_b`, `a`, and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
