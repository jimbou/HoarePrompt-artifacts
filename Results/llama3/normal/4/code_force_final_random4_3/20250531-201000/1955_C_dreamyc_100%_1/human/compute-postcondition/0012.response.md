The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k/2, b is the floor of k/2, s_a is the value of the first element in nums, s_b is the value of the last element in nums, i is 1. If the value of the first element in nums is less than or equal to a and the value of the last element in nums is less than or equal to b, then ans is 2. If the value of the first element in nums is less than or equal to a but the value of the last element in nums is larger than b, then ans is 1. If the value of the first element in nums is larger than a, then ans is 0.**
