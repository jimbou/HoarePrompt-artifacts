Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers, `a` is the ceiling of `k/2`, `b` is the floor of `k/2`, `ans` is 2 if the value of the first element in `nums` is less than or equal to `a`, otherwise `ans` is 1, `s_a` is the value of the first element in `nums`, `s_b` is the value of the last element in `nums`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. If the first element in `nums` is less than or equal to `a`, `ans` is now 2; otherwise, `ans` is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
