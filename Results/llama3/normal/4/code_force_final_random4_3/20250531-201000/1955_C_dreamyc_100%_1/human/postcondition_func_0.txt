This function determines the number of elements in a list that can be divided into two parts, each with a sum less than or equal to half of a given target value k. If the sum of all elements in the list is less than or equal to k, it returns the total number of elements in the list. Otherwise, it calculates the number of times the sum of the first i elements and the sum of the last i elements are less than or equal to the ceiling and floor of k/2, respectively, where i is the number of elements in the list minus one.
