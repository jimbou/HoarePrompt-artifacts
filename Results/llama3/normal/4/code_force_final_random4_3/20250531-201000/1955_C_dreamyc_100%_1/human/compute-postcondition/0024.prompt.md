Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k/2, b is the floor of k/2, ans is 0, s_a is 0, s_b is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    s_a += nums[i]
    s_b += nums[n - i - 1]
    if s_a <= a:
        ans += 1
    if s_b <= b:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k/2, b is the floor of k/2, s_a is the value of the first element in nums, s_b is the value of the last element in nums, i is 0. If the value of the first element in nums is less than or equal to a and the value of the last element in nums is less than or equal to b, then ans is 2. If the value of the first element in nums is less than or equal to a but the value of the last element in nums is larger than b, then ans is 1. If the value of the first element in nums is larger than a, then ans is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k/2, b is the floor of k/2, s_a is the value of the first two elements in nums, s_b is the value of the last two elements in nums, i is 1. If s_a is less than or equal to a, then if s_b is less than or equal to b, ans is either 2, 3, or 4 depending on the initial values of s_a, s_b, a, and b. Otherwise, ans is increased by 1. If s_a is greater than a, ans is either 1, 2, or 3 depending on the initial values of s_a, s_b, a, and b. Otherwise, ans remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k/2, b is the floor of k/2, s_a is the sum of the first three elements in nums, s_b is the sum of the last three elements in nums, i is 2. If s_a is less than or equal to a and s_b is less than or equal to b, ans is increased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by 1 only if s_a is less than or equal to a.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
