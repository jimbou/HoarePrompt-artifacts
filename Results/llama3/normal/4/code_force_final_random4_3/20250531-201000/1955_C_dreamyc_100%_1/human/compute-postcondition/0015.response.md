Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k/2, b is the floor of k/2, s_a is the value of the first two elements in nums, s_b is the value of the last two elements in nums, i is 1. If s_a is less than or equal to a, ans is either 1, 2, or 3 depending on the initial values of s_a, s_b, a, and b. Otherwise, ans remains unchanged.***
