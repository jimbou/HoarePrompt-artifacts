Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k/2, b is the floor of k/2, s_a is the sum of the first three elements in nums, s_b is the sum of the last three elements in nums, i is 2. If s_a is less than or equal to a and s_b is less than or equal to b, ans is increased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by 1 only if s_a is less than or equal to a.***
