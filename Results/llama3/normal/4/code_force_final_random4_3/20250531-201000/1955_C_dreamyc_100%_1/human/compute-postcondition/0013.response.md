Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k/2, b is the floor of k/2, s_a is the value of the first two elements in nums, s_b is the value of the last two elements in nums, i is 1, ans is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the initial values of s_a, s_b, a, and b.**

The code modifies the values of `s_a` and `s_b` by adding the second element of `nums` to `s_a` and the second last element of `nums` to `s_b`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `ans` are not affected by the code and retain their initial values. The value of `ans` is determined by the initial values of `s_a`, `s_b`, `a`, and `b`, and its value is either 0, 1, or 2 based on the conditions specified in the initial state.
