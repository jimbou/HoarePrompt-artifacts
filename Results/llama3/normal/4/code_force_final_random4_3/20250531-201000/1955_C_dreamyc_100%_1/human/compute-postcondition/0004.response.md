To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the range `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, which already ensures that the loop will execute. However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect that it will start from 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers, `a` is the ceiling of `k/2`, `b` is the floor of `k/2`, `ans` is 0, `s_a` is 0, `s_b` is 0, `i` is 0**
