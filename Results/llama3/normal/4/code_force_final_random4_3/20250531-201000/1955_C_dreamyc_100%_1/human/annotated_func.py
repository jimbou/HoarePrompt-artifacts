        #The program returns a positive integer n, which is the number of elements in the list 'nums'.
    #State: *n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, and nums is a list of n positive integers. The sum of the elements in nums is larger than k

    #State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k/2, b is the floor of k/2, s_a is the sum of all elements in nums, s_b is the sum of all elements in nums, i is n-1, ans is the number of times the sum of the first i elements and the sum of the last i elements are less than or equal to a and b respectively.
    return ans
    #The program returns the number of times the sum of the first i elements and the sum of the last i elements are less than or equal to a and b respectively, where i is n-1, a is the ceiling of k/2, b is the floor of k/2, and n and k are positive integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the number of elements in a list that can be divided into two parts, each with a sum less than or equal to half of a given target value k. If the sum of all elements in the list is less than or equal to k, it returns the total number of elements in the list. Otherwise, it calculates the number of times the sum of the first i elements and the sum of the last i elements are less than or equal to the ceiling and floor of k/2, respectively, where i is the number of elements in the list minus one.
