Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k/2, b is the floor of k/2, ans is 0, s_a is 0, s_b is 0**

The code assigns the ceiling of k/2 to a and the floor of k/2 to b. It also initializes ans, s_a, and s_b to 0. The values of n, k, and nums remain unchanged.
