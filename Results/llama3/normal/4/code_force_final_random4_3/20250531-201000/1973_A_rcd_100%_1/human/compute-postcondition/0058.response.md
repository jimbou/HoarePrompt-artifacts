The variables in the loop head are x and y, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables x and y. If y is greater than or equal to x, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is one more than its original value and y is one less than its original value. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the original value of y must be greater than the original value of x. Also, y must be greater than or equal to x after the last iteration, so x must be less than or equal to y - 1 after the last iteration, and the original value of x must be less than or equal to y - 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 1 and 30 inclusive and `p3` is greater than or equal to 2 and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`, x is an integer and is one more than its original value and the original value of x is less than or equal to y - 2, and y is an integer and is one less than its original value and the original value of y is greater than the original value of x**
