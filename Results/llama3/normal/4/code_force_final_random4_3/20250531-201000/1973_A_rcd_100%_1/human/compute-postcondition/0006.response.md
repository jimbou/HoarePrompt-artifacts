Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an odd number, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain the same. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is still an odd number. We skip the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next one. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one less than before.
