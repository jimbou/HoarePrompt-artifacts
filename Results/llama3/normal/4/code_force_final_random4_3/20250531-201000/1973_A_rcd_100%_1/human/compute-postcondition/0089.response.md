According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `y`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is an integer greater than its original value by 1, and `y` is an integer greater than or equal to 0. `y` being greater than or equal to 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `y` is greater than or equal to `x`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`, `p3` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer greater than its original value by 1, and `y` is greater than or equal to `x`.**
