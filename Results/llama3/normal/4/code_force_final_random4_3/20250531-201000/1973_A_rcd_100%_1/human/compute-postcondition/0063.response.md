Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 1 and 30 inclusive and `p3` is greater than or equal to 2 and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`, if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `p1 - x + p3` has been printed, and `x` is an integer and is one more than its original value and the original value of `x` is less than or equal to `y - 2`, and `y` is an integer and is one less than its original value and the original value of `y` is greater than the original value of `x`. Otherwise, `x` is an integer and is two more than its original value and the original value of `x` is less than or equal to `y - 2`, and `y` is an integer and is two less than its original value and the original value of `y` is greater than the original value of `x`.**
