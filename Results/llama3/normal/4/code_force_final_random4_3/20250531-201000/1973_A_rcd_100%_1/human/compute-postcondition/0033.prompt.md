Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 0, p1 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, p2 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and p2 is greater than or equal to p1, p3 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and p3 is greater than or equal to p2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, x is 0, y is p3
Code of the loop:
while y >= x:
    if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
        print(p1 - x + p3)
        break
    else:
        x += 1
        y -= 1
else:
    print(p3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 0, p1 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, p2 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and p2 is greater than or equal to p1, p3 is an integer between 1 and 30 inclusive and p3 is greater than or equal to p2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If p1 - x is less than or equal to p2 - y, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, x is 1, y is p3 - 1, and p1 - x is greater than p2 - y.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 0, p1 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, p2 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and p2 is greater than or equal to p1, p3 is an integer between 2 and 30 inclusive and p3 is greater than or equal to p2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If p1 - x is less than or equal to p2 - y, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, x is 1 more than its original value and y is 1 less than its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 0, p1 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, p2 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and p2 is greater than or equal to p1, p3 is an integer between 2 and 30 inclusive and p3 is greater than or equal to p2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If p1 - x is less than or equal to p2 - y, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, x is an integer greater than its original value and y is an integer less than its original value.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
