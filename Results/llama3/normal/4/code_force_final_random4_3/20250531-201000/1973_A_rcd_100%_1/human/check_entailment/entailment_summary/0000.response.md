Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the constraints of the problem, such as the sum of the scores being even and the relative values of the scores. The program also correctly calculates the maximum possible number of draws that could have happened, considering the possible combinations of wins and losses between the players.

The program first checks if the sum of the scores is odd, in which case it prints -1, as this is not a valid scenario. Then, it checks if the score of the third player is greater than or equal to the sum of the scores of the first two players. If this is the case, it prints the sum of the scores of the first two players, as this is the maximum possible number of draws.

If the score of the third player is not greater than or equal to the sum of the scores of the first two players, the program enters a loop where it increments the score of the first player and decrements the score of the third player until the score of the first player is greater than or equal to the score of the second player. At this point, it prints the score of the first player plus the score of the third player, which is the maximum possible number of draws.

The program correctly handles all possible scenarios and constraints of the problem, and it produces the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
