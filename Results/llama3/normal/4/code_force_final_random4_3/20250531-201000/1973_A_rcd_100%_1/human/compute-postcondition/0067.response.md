Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are updated to integers between 0 and 30 inclusive, with `p1` being less than or equal to `p2`, and `p2` being less than or equal to `p3`. The stdin is now empty as it has been used to input the values for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
