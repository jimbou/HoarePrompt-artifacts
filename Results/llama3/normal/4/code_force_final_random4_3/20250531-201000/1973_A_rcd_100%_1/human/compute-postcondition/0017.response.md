Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 1 and 30 inclusive and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`, `x` is 0, `y` is `p3`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `x`, and `y` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1.
