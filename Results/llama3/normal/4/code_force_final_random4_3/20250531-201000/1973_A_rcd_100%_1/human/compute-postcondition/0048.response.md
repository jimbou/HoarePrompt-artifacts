Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`, `x` is 0, `y` is `p3`, the current value of `p1` minus `x` is less than or equal to the current value of `p2` minus `y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `x`, and `y` remain the same as in the initial state. The relationship between `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` also remains the same. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
