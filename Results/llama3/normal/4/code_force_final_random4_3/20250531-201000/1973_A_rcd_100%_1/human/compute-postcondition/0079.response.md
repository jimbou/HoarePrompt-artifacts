Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`, `x` is 0, `y` is equal to `p3`, `p3` is greater than or equal to 0, the current value of `p1` minus `x` is less than or equal to `p2` minus `y`, the sum of `p1` and `p3` has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, since the `break` statement only exits the current loop or if statement without modifying any variables. The only additional information is that we have exited the loop or if statement, and the sum of `p1` and `p3` has been printed.
