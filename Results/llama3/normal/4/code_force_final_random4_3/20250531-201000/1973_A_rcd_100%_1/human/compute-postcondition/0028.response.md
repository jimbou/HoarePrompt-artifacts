The code prints the value of `p1` minus `x` plus `p3`. Here, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, `x` is a variable whose value is not explicitly given but is related to the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, and `p3` is an integer between 2 and 30 inclusive.

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `p1 - x + p3`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the expression `p1 - x + p3`.

Output: **p1 - x + p3 (where p1 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, x is a value related to the condition p1 - x <= p2 - y, and p3 is an integer between 2 and 30 inclusive)**
