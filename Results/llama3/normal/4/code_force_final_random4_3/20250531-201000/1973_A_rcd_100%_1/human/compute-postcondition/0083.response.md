According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y` and `x`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1, `y` is equal to `p3` minus 1. `y` being equal to `p3` minus 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `y` is greater than or equal to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`, `p3` is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is greater than or equal to 1**
