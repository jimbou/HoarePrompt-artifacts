Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`, `p3` is greater than or equal to 0. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `x` is an integer greater than its original value by 1, and `y` is greater than or equal to `x`. Otherwise, `x` is an integer greater than its original value by 2, and `y` is greater than or equal to `x`.***
