According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `y`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1, `y` is `p3 - 1`, and `p3` is an integer between 1 and 30 inclusive. Since `y` is `p3 - 1`, `p3` must be greater than 1 for `y` to be greater than or equal to `x`. Therefore, `p3` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 1.

State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 0, p1 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, p2 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and p2 is greater than or equal to p1, p3 is an integer between 2 and 30 inclusive and p3 is greater than or equal to p2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**
