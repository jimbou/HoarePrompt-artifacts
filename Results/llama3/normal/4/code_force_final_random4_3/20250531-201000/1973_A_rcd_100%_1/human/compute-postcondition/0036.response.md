Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, respectively. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are updated to the new input values, but their relationships and ranges remain the same. The stdin now contains one less test case.
