Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`, `p3` is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is greater than or equal to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code only contains a `break` statement, which means it will exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently inside. The values of all variables remain unchanged, so the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of breaking out of the innermost loop or if statement.
