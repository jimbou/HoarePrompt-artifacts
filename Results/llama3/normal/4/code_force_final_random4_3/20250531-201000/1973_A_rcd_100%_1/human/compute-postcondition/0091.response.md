The code prints the result of the expression `p1 - x + p3`, where `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, `x` is an integer greater than its original value by 1, and `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive.
Output: ** `t` is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`, `p3` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer greater than its original value by 1, and `y` is greater than or equal to `x`, and the value of `p1 - x + p3` is being printed**
