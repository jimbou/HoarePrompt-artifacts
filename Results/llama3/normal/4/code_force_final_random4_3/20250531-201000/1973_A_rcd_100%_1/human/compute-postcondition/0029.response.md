Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 0, p1 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, p2 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and p2 is greater than or equal to p1, p3 is an integer between 2 and 30 inclusive and p3 is greater than or equal to p2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If p1 - x is less than or equal to p2 - y, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, y is greater than or equal to x + 1 and x is less than or equal to y - 1, and the value of p1 - x + p3 is being printed**
