Output: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`, `x` is 0, `y` is `p3`. The current value of `p1` minus `x` is less than or equal to the current value of `p2` minus `y`, and the sum of `p1` and `p3` is being printed, which is equal to `p1` + `p3`**
