Based on the initial state, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive.
* `x` is 0.
* `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, and it is greater than or equal to 0.

The print statement is `print(p1 - x + p3)`. Since `x` is 0, the expression `p1 - x` simplifies to just `p1`. Therefore, the print statement is equivalent to `print(p1 + p3)`.

Since `p1` and `p3` are both integers between 0 and 30 inclusive, their sum will be an integer between 0 and 60 inclusive.

Output: **an integer between 0 and 60 inclusive, which is the sum of p1 and p3**
