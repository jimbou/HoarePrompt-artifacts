Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`, `p3` is greater than or equal to 0. If `p1` minus `x` is less than or equal to `p2` minus `y`, the sum of `p1` and `p3` has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is 1, `y` is equal to `p3` minus 1.**
