Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, _ is 1, p1 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, p2 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and p2 is greater than or equal to p1, p3 is an integer between 1 and 30 inclusive and p3 is greater than or equal to 2 and p3 is greater than or equal to p2, x is an integer and x is one more than its original value, y is an integer and y is one less than its original value.**

The code snippet increments the value of `x` by 1 and decrements the value of `y` by 1. The initial state of `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remains unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The values of `x` and `y` are updated according to the operations performed on them.
