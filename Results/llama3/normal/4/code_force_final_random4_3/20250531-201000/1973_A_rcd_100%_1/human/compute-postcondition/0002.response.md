Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are assigned the values of the three integers from the input, which are between 0 and 30 inclusive and are sorted in non-decreasing order. The stdin now contains one less test case.
