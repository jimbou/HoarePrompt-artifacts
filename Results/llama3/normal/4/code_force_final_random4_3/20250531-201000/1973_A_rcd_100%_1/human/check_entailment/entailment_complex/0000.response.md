Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly handles the case where the sum of the scores is odd. In this case, it prints -1, which is the correct output according to the problem statement.
2.  When the sum of the scores is even, the program checks if the score of the third player is greater than or equal to the sum of the scores of the first two players. If this condition is true, it prints the sum of the scores of the first two players, which is the maximum possible number of draws.
3.  If the score of the third player is less than the sum of the scores of the first two players, the program enters a while loop where it increments `x` and decrements `y` until `y` is less than `x`. Inside the loop, it checks if the score of the first player minus `x` is less than or equal to the score of the second player minus `y`. If this condition is true, it prints the score of the first player minus `x` plus the score of the third player, which is the maximum possible number of draws.
4.  If the while loop completes without finding a valid solution, the program prints the score of the third player, which is the maximum possible number of draws in this case.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible number of draws based on the given scores and handles all possible cases.

Correctness: **True**
