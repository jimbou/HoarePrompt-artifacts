According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. However, to make the loop execute, we need to adjust the state of `_` (the loop variable) to be 0, since it will take on the values 0, 1, 2, ..., t-1 during the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) â€” the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly.**
