Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 0, p1 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, p2 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and p2 is greater than or equal to p1, p3 is an integer between 1 and 30 inclusive and p3 is greater than or equal to p2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, x is 1, y is p3 - 1, and (p1 - x > p2 - y)**

In natural language, the output state indicates that the values of `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged. The value of `x` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `y` has been decremented by 1. The condition `(p1 - x > p2 - y)` is still valid, as the changes to `x` and `y` do not affect the inequality. The number of test cases in `stdin` has decreased by 1.
