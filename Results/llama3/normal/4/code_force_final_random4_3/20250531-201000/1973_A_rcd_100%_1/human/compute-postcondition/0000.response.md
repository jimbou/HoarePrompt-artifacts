Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) â€” the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first input, which is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each containing three integers p_1, p_2 and p_3, which are the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly.
