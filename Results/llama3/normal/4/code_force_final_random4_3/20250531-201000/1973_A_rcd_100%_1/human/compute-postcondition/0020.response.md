Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 0, p1 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, p2 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and p2 is greater than or equal to p1, p3 is an integer between 1 and 30 inclusive and p3 is greater than or equal to p2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If p1 - x is less than or equal to p2 - y, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, x is 1, y is p3 - 1, and p1 - x is greater than p2 - y.***
