Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive, _ is 2, p1, p2, p3 are integers between 0 and 30 inclusive, p1 is less than or equal to p2, p2 is less than or equal to p3, p3 is greater than or equal to 0, x is equal to y.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the values of t, _, p1, p2, and p3 remain unchanged. The loop continues to execute until x is equal to y, at which point the loop terminates.
