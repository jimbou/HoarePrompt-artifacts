The code prints the value of the expression `p1 - x + p3`. 

Here, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, `x` is not defined in the initial state, and `p3` is an integer between 2 and 30 inclusive and is greater than or equal to `p2`.

Since the value of `x` is not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the expression `p1 - x + p3`.

Output: **p1 - x + p3 (where p1 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, x is an unknown value, and p3 is an integer between 2 and 30 inclusive)**
