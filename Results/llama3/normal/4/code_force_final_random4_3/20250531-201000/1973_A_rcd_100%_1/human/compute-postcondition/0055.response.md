Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 1 and 30 inclusive and `p3` is greater than or equal to 2 and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`, and the value of `p1 - x + p3` has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the value of `p1 - x + p3` has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
