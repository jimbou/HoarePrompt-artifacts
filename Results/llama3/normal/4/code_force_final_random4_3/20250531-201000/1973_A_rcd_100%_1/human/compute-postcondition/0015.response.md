The code prints the sum of `p1`, `p3`, and the negation of `x`. Where `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p3` is an integer between 1 and 30 inclusive and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`, and `x` is 0.
Output: **p1 + p3 (where p1 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and p3 is an integer between 1 and 30 inclusive and p3 is greater than or equal to p2)**
