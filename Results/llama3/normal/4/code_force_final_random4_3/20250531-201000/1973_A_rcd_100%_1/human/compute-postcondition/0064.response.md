Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 1 and 30 inclusive and `p3` is greater than or equal to 2 and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`, `x` is an integer and is equal to `p3`, `y` is 0, and `p1 - x + p3` has been printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged, but `x` has been incremented to be equal to `p3`, and `y` has been decremented to 0. Additionally, the value of `p1 - x + p3` has been printed.
