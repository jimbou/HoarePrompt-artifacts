According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable y and x. If y is greater than or equal to x, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, y is 1 less than its original value and x is 1 more than its original value. So for the loop to be executed one more time y must be greater than or equal to x + 1 and x must be less than or equal to y - 1.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 0, p1 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, p2 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and p2 is greater than or equal to p1, p3 is an integer between 2 and 30 inclusive and p3 is greater than or equal to p2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If p1 - x is less than or equal to p2 - y, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, y is greater than or equal to x + 1 and x is less than or equal to y - 1**
