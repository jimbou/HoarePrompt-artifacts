The code prints the sum of `p1` and `p2`, where `p1` and `p2` are integers between 0 and 30 inclusive, and `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`. Since the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even (as the program only continues to execute when this condition is met), the sum of `p1` and `p2` will also be even.
Output: **an even integer between 0 and 60 inclusive**
