According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `y`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1, `y` is `p3 - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be greater than or equal to 1, so `p3` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 1 and 30 inclusive and `p3` is greater than or equal to 2 and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`.**
