The code prints the result of the expression `p1 - x + p3`. 

Here, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, `x` is not defined in the initial state, and `p3` is an integer between 1 and 30 inclusive and `p3` is greater than or equal to 2 and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`.

Since `x` is not defined in the initial state, we can't determine its exact value. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the expression `p1 - x + p3`.

Output: **p1 - x + p3 (where p1 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, x is an undefined value, and p3 is an integer between 1 and 30 inclusive and p3 is greater than or equal to 2 and p3 is greater than or equal to p2)**
