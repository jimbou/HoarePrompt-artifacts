Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 1 and 30 inclusive and `p3` is greater than or equal to 2 and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, then the value of `p1 - x + p3` has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is an integer and is one more than its original value, and `y` is an integer and is one less than its original value.**
