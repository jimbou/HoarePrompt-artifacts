Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) â€” the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
    if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
        print(-1)
        continue
    if p3 >= p1 + p2:
        print(p1 + p2)
    else:
        x = 0
        y = p3
        while y >= x:
            if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
                print(p1 - x + p3)
                break
            else:
                x += 1
                y -= 1
        else:
            print(p3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number and `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` which is an integer between 0 and 60 inclusive is being printed. Otherwise, `x` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, `y` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, we skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program continues to the next statement. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1` + `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. Otherwise, `x` is an integer and is equal to `p3`, `y` is 0, and `p1 - x + p3` has been printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1` + `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. Otherwise, if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even and `p3` is less than `p1` + `p2`, then `x` is equal to `y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
