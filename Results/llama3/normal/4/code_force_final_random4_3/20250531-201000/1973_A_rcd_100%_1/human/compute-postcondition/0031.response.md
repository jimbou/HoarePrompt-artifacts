Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 0, p1 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, p2 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and p2 is greater than or equal to p1, p3 is an integer between 2 and 30 inclusive and p3 is greater than or equal to p2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, x is an integer greater than its original value, y is an integer less than its original value.**

In this output state, the values of t, _, p1, p2, and p3 remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The value of x has increased by 1, and the value of y has decreased by 1. The relationship between x and y is now such that y is greater than or equal to x + 1 and x is less than or equal to y - 1.
