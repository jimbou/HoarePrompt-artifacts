According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `y` and `x`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `x`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `x` is 0, `y` is equal to `p3`. `p3` being an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `p3` is greater than or equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **t is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive, _ is 2, p1, p2, p3 are integers between 0 and 30 inclusive, p1 is less than or equal to p2, p2 is less than or equal to p3, x is 0, y is equal to p3 and p3 is greater than or equal to 0**
