Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there are no changes to the variables, their values remain the same. The only change is that we move to the next iteration of the loop, skipping any remaining code inside the current iteration.
