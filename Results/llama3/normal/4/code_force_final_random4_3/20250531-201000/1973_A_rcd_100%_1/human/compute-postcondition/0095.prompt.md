Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive, _ is 2, p1, p2, p3 are integers between 0 and 30 inclusive, p1 is less than or equal to p2, p2 is less than or equal to p3, x is 0, y is equal to p3.
Code of the loop:
while y >= x:
    if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
        print(p1 - x + p3)
        break
    else:
        x += 1
        y -= 1
else:
    print(p3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`, `p3` is greater than or equal to 0. If `p1` minus `x` is less than or equal to `p2` minus `y`, the sum of `p1` and `p3` has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is 1, `y` is equal to `p3` minus 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`, `p3` is greater than or equal to 0. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is an integer greater than its original value by 1, and `y` is an integer greater than or equal to 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`, `p3` is greater than or equal to 0. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `x` is an integer greater than its original value by 1, and `y` is greater than or equal to `x`. Otherwise, `x` is an integer greater than its original value by 2, and `y` is greater than or equal to `x`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
