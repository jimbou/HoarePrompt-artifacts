Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 0, p1 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, p2 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and p2 is greater than or equal to p1, p3 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and p3 is greater than or equal to p2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, x is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, y is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and y is less than or equal to x.**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the values of t, _, p1, p2, p3, and stdin remain unchanged from their initial values. The loop has modified the values of x and y. The value of x is now an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the value of y is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and is less than or equal to x.
