Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 2 and 30 inclusive and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain the same as in the initial state. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1.
