Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, _ is 1, p1 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, p2 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and p2 is greater than or equal to p1, p3 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and p3 is greater than or equal to p2, x is 0, y is p3.
Code of the loop:
while y >= x:
    if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
        print(p1 - x + p3)
        break
    else:
        x += 1
        y -= 1
else:
    print(p3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is 1, `y` is `p3 - 1`, and `p1 - x` is greater than `p2 - y`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 1 and 30 inclusive and `p3` is greater than or equal to 2 and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, then the value of `p1 - x + p3` has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is an integer and is one more than its original value, and `y` is an integer and is one less than its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 1 and 30 inclusive and `p3` is greater than or equal to 2 and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`, if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `p1 - x + p3` has been printed, and `x` is an integer and is one more than its original value and the original value of `x` is less than or equal to `y - 2`, and `y` is an integer and is one less than its original value and the original value of `y` is greater than the original value of `x`. Otherwise, `x` is an integer and is two more than its original value and the original value of `x` is less than or equal to `y - 2`, and `y` is an integer and is two less than its original value and the original value of `y` is greater than the original value of `x`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
