Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, we skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program continues to the next statement.***
