Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when p1 + p2 + p3 is even but the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games and results. For example, if the input is 1 1 3, the program will print 2, but this is not correct because there is no way to obtain these scores with a non-negative number of games between the three players.

In this case, the program should print -1, but it does not. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
