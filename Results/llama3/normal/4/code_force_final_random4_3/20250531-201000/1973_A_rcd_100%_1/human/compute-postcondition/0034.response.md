Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number and `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` which is an integer between 0 and 60 inclusive is being printed. Otherwise, `x` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, `y` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and `y` is less than or equal to `x`.***
