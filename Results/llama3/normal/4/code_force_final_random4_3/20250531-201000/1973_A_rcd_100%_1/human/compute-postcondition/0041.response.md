The code prints the sum of `p1` and `p2`, where `p1` and `p2` are integers between 0 and 30 inclusive, and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`. Since the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even (as the program skips the current iteration if the sum is odd), the sum of `p1` and `p2` will also be even.
Output: **an even integer between 0 and 60 inclusive (which is the sum of p1 and p2)**
