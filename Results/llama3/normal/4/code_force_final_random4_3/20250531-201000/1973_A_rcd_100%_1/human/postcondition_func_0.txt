This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers representing the scores of three players. It then determines the maximum possible score that can be achieved by the first two players, considering the constraint that the sum of all three scores must be even. If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the maximum possible score of the first two players, which is either the sum of their scores or the score of the third player, depending on the relative values of the scores.
