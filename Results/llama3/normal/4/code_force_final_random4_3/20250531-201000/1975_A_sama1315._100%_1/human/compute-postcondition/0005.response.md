To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 (since `t` is greater than 1) and `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` is 2.

The state of `t` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The state of `data`, `idx`, and `results` are not modified in the loop head, so they remain the same.

State: **`data` is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, followed by a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer n followed by n positive integers. The integers are separated by spaces, `idx` is 2 + 2n + 1, `t` is greater than 1, `results` is a list containing the results of func_1(a) for two test cases, where a is a list of n positive integers, `_` is 2**
