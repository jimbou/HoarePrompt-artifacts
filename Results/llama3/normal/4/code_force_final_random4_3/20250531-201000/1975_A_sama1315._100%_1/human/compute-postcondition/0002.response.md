Output State: **data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, followed by a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer n followed by n positive integers. The integers are separated by spaces, idx is 1 + n + 1, t is greater than 0, results is a list containing the result of func_1(a), where a is a list of n positive integers.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The code processes the first test case in the data list. It extracts the number of integers (n) in the test case and increments the index (idx) by 1. Then, it extracts the n positive integers from the data list, starting from the current index, and stores them in the list 'a'. The index is incremented by n to point to the next test case. The function func_1 is called with the list 'a' as an argument, and the result is appended to the results list. The final state reflects the updated index and the addition of the result to the results list.
