Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The function `func_1` checks if the array `a` can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. It does this by concatenating the array with itself and checking if the sorted array is a substring of the concatenated array. If it is, then the array can be made non-decreasing, and the function returns 'Yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'No'.

The function `func_2` reads the input from the standard input, parses it, and calls `func_1` for each test case. It then prints the results.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles all possible inputs and edge cases, including arrays of length 2, arrays with duplicate elements, and arrays that are already sorted. Therefore, the program is correct.
