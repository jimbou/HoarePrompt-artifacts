Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. The provided program uses a function `func_1` to solve this problem.

`func_1` first creates a sorted version of the input array `a`. Then, it concatenates the original array with itself to create a new array `concatenated_a`. The function then checks if any contiguous subarray of `concatenated_a` with the same length as the original array is equal to the sorted array. If such a subarray is found, the function returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be sorted by swapping two parts. If no such subarray is found after checking all possible subarrays, the function returns 'No'.

The main function `func_2` reads input from the standard input, parses it, and calls `func_1` for each test case. It then prints the results.

The program's logic is correct. By concatenating the original array with itself, it effectively allows the function to check all possible swaps of two parts of the array. The function correctly checks if any of these swaps result in a sorted array.

However, the program does not handle invalid inputs. For example, if the input array contains non-integer values or values outside the specified range, the program may produce incorrect results or crash. Additionally, the program does not check if the input array is empty, which could also lead to incorrect results.

Despite these limitations, the program's logic is correct for valid inputs as described in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
