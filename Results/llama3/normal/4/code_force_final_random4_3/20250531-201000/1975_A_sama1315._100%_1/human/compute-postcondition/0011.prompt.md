Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of n positive integers, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list a, sorted_a is a sorted list of the integers in a, concatenated_a is a list of 2n positive integers, which is the concatenation of list a with itself.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:
        return 'Yes'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of at least one positive integer, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of list `a`, `sorted_a` is a sorted list of the integers in `a`, `concatenated_a` is a list of 2n positive integers, which is the concatenation of list `a` with itself, `i` is 0. The first n elements of `concatenated_a` are not equal to `sorted_a`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The program returns 'Yes' if the sublist of `concatenated_a` from index `i` to `i + len(sorted_a)` is equal to `sorted_a`, otherwise it returns None.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *The program returns 'Yes' if the sublist of `concatenated_a` from index `i` to `i + len(sorted_a)` is equal to `sorted_a`, otherwise it returns None.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
