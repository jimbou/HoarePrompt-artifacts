Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after performing the specified operation any number of times.

Function 1 correctly checks if a sorted version of the input list is present as a contiguous sublist in the concatenation of the original list with itself. This is a necessary and sufficient condition for the array to be sortable by the specified operation.

Function 2 correctly reads input from standard input, processes it into a list of test cases, applies Function 1 to each test case, and prints the results.

The program handles all possible inputs as described in the problem, including valid inputs where the array can be sorted and invalid inputs where the array cannot be sorted.

Correctness: **True**
