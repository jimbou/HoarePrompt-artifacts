Output: **data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, followed by a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer n followed by n positive integers. The integers are separated by spaces, idx is t + t*n + t, t is 0, results is a list containing the results of func_1(a) for t test cases, where a is a list of n positive integers, _ is t-1, and the results of func_1(a) for t test cases are printed, each result on a new line**
