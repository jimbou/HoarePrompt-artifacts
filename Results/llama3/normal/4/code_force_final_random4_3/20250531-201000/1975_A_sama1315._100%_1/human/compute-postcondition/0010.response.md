Functionality: **This function reads input from standard input, processes it into a list of test cases, applies the func_1 function to each test case, and prints the results. The input is expected to be a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, followed by a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer n followed by n positive integers. The function returns no value but prints the results of func_1(a) for each test case, where a is a list of n positive integers.**
