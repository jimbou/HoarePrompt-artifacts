Output State: **data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, followed by a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer n followed by n positive integers. The integers are separated by spaces, idx is t + t*n + t, t is 0, results is a list containing the results of func_1(a) for t test cases, where a is a list of n positive integers, _ is t-1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the data list remains unchanged, the index `idx` has moved to the end of the list, the value of `t` has been decremented to 0, the `results` list contains the results of `func_1(a)` for all `t` test cases, and the loop variable `_` has reached its final value of `t-1`.
