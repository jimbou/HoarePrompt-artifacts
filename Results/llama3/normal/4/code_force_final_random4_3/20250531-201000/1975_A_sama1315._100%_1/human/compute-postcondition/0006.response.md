Output State: **data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, followed by a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer n followed by n positive integers. The integers are separated by spaces, idx is 2 + 2n + 1 + n + 1, t is greater than 1, results is a list containing the results of func_1(a) for three test cases, where a is a list of n positive integers, _ is 2**

In this final state, the value of `idx` has been incremented by `n + 1` due to the execution of the code. The `results` list now contains the result of `func_1(a)` for three test cases, where `a` is a list of `n` positive integers. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
