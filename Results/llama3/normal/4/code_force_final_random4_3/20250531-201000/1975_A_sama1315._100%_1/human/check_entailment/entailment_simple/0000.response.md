Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by swapping its prefix and suffix. The program uses a clever approach by concatenating the array with itself and then checking if any sublist of the concatenated array is equal to the sorted array.

The program correctly implements this approach in Function 1. It first calculates the length of the input array `a` and sorts it to get `sorted_a`. Then, it concatenates `a` with itself to get `concatenated_a`. The program then iterates over the range of `n` (the length of `a`) and checks if any sublist of `concatenated_a` from index `i` to `i + len(sorted_a)` is equal to `sorted_a`. If it finds a match, it returns 'Yes'. If no match is found after iterating over the entire range, it returns 'No'.

Function 2 is responsible for reading the input data and calling Function 1 for each test case. It correctly reads the input data, extracts the test cases, and calls Function 1 for each test case. The results are then printed out.

Therefore, the program is correct in its approach and implementation.

Correctness: **True**
