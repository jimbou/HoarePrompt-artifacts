Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a given array of positive integers can be sorted in non-decreasing order after performing a specific operation (splitting the array into two parts and swapping them) any number of times.

Function `func_1` checks if a sorted version of the input array is present as a contiguous sublist in the concatenation of the original array with itself. This is a correct approach to solve the problem, as the operation of splitting and swapping the array can be simulated by checking if the sorted array is a contiguous sublist of the concatenated array.

Function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes it into a list of test cases, applies `func_1` to each test case, and prints the results. This function is also correct, as it properly reads and processes the input, applies the correct function to each test case, and prints the results.

Therefore, the given program is correct, as both functions work together to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
