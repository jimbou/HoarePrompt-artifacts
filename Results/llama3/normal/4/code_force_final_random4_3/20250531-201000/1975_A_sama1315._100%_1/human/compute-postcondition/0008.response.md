Based on the precondition, we can deduce the following:

* `data` is a list of strings, where the first element is a positive integer `t`, followed by a sequence of test cases.
* Each test case consists of a positive integer `n` followed by `n` positive integers.
* `idx` is calculated as `t + t*n + t`, but since `t` is 0, `idx` is also 0.
* `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(a)` for `t` test cases, where `a` is a list of `n` positive integers.
* `_` is `t-1`, which is -1 since `t` is 0.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print('\n'.join(results))`

The `join()` method concatenates all the elements in the `results` list into a single string, separated by newline characters (`\n`).

Since `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(a)` for `t` test cases, and `t` is 0, the `results` list is empty.

Therefore, the output will be an empty string, with no newline characters.

Output: **(empty string)**
