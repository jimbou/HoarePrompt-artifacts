Output State: **data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, followed by a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer n followed by n positive integers. The integers are separated by spaces, idx is 2 + 2n + 1, t is greater than 1, results is a list containing the results of func_1(a) for two test cases, where a is a list of n positive integers.**

In this output state, the value of `idx` has been incremented by `n + 1` due to the execution of the code, where `n` is the number of positive integers in the current test case. The value of `results` has been appended with the result of `func_1(a)` for the current test case. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
