According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted.


State: **data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, followed by a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer n followed by n positive integers. The integers are separated by spaces, idx is 1, t is greater than 0, results is an empty list**
