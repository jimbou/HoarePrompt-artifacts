The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer between 0 and n - x + 1, `a` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 0 to n-1, `present` is a set of x distinct integers from 0 to n-1, `ans` is an integer equal to x - 1 if t1 is not in present and t2 is in present, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 2, `i` is 2, `t1` is an integer equal to (a[i] + 1) % n, `t2` is an integer equal to (a[i] + 2) % n, stdin contains t-1 test cases**
