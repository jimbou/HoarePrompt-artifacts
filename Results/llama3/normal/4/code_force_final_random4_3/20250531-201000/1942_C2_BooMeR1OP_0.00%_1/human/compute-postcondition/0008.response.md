Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 1 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer between 0 and n - x + 1, `a` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 0 to n-1, `present` is a set of x distinct integers from 0 to n-1, `ans` is an integer equal to x - 1 if t1 is not in present and t2 is in present, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 2, `i` is 1, `t1` is an integer equal to (a[i] + 1) % n, `t2` is an integer equal to (a[i] + 2) % n, stdin contains t-1 test cases, x must be greater than 1**

The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` was x - 2 if t1 is not in present and t2 is in present, otherwise x - 3. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is x - 1 if t1 is not in present and t2 is in present, otherwise x - 2. The values of the other variables are not affected.
