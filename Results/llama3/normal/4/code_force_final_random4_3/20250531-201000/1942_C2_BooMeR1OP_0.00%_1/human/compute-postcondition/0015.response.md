Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer equal to 0, `y` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers from 0 to `n-1`, `present` is a set of `n` distinct integers from 0 to `n-1`, `ans` is an integer equal to 0, `i` is 0, `t1` is an integer equal to (a[0] + 1) % `n`, `t2` is an integer equal to (a[0] + 2) % `n`, `gaps` is an empty list, stdin contains `t-1` test cases.**

In this output state, a new variable `gaps` has been introduced and is assigned an empty list. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases.
