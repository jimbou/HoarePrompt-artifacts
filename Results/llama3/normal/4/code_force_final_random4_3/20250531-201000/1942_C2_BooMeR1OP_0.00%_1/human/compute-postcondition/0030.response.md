Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `y` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers from 0 to `n-1`, `present` is a set of `n` distinct integers from 0 to `n-1`, `ans` is an integer equal to 0, `i` is equal to `x`, `t1` is an integer equal to (`a[x-1] + 1`) % `n`, `t2` is an integer equal to (`a[x-1] + 2`) % `n`, `gaps` is a sorted list containing one or two integers, the first integer is equal to (`a[(x-1 + 1) % x] + (n if x-1 == x - 1 else 0)`) - `a[x-1] - 1`, and if the current value of `gap` is greater than 0, the second integer is equal to the current value of `gap`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[(x-1 + 1) % x] + (n if x-1 == x - 1 else 0)`, and the current value of `gap` is an integer greater than or equal to 0. If `gap` is greater than 0, `gaps` contains two integers.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `gaps` is now sorted in ascending order. All other variables remain unchanged.
