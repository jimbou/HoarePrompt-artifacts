Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer between 0 and n - x, `a` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 0 to n-1, `present` is a set of x distinct integers from 0 to n-1, `ans` is an integer equal to x - 1, `i` is 0, `t1` is an integer equal to (a[0] + 1) % n, `t2` is an integer equal to (a[0] + 2) % n, stdin contains t-1 test cases, x must be greater than 0. The current value of t1 is not in present and the current value of t2 is in present.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so it is now equal to `x - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `present`, `i`, `t1`, and `t2` are still valid. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases. The current value of `t1` is still not in `present`, and the current value of `t2` is still in `present`.
