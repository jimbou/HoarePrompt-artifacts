Output State: **n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is an integer between 0 and n - x + 1, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 0 to n-1, present is a set of x distinct integers from 0 to n-1, ans is an integer equal to x - 1 if t1 is not in present and t2 is in present, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 2, i is 2, t1 is an integer equal to (a[i] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[i] + 2) % n, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

The code snippet provided does not modify the values of any variables except for `t1` and `t2`. The first line assigns the value of `(a[i] + 1) % n` to `t1`, and the second line assigns the value of `(a[i] + 2) % n` to `t2`. The values of `t1` and `t2` are calculated based on the current values of `a[i]` and `n`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
