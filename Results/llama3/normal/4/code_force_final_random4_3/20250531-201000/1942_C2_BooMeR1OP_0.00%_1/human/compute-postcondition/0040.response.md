Output State: **n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer greater than or equal to 0, y is an integer between 0 and n, a is a sorted list of n distinct integers from 0 to n-1, present is a set of n distinct integers from 0 to n-1, i is equal to x, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x-1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x-1] + 2) % n, gaps is a sorted list containing at least two integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases, next_elem is an integer equal to a[(x-1 + 1) % x] + (n if x-1 == x - 1 else 0), ans is an integer equal to ans + gap, y is an integer equal to y - pairs, pairs is an integer equal to gap // 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `x`, `a`, `present`, `i`, `t1`, `t2`, `gaps`, `stdin`, and `next_elem` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is increased by `gap`. The value of `y` is decreased by `pairs`, which is half of `gap`.
