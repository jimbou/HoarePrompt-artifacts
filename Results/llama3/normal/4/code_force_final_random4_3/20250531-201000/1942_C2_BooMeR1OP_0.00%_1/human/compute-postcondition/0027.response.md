Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than 2, `y` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers from 0 to `n-1`, `present` is a set of `n` distinct integers from 0 to `n-1`, `ans` is an integer equal to 0, `i` is 2, `t1` is an integer equal to (`a[1] + 1`) % `n`, `t2` is an integer equal to (`a[1] + 2`) % `n`, `gaps` is a list containing two integers, the first integer is equal to (`a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`) - `a[i] - 1`, and the second integer is equal to the current value of gap, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`, and the current value of gap is an integer greater than or equal to 0.**

The code appends the current value of gap to the list gaps. Since the current value of gap is greater than or equal to 0, gaps now contains two integers. The first integer is the difference between the next element in the list a and the current element, minus 1, and the second integer is the current value of gap. The other variables remain unchanged.
