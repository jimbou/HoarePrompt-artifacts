Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `y` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers from 0 to `n-1`, `present` is a set of `n` distinct integers from 0 to `n-1`, `ans` is an integer equal to 0, `i` is equal to `x`, `t1` is an integer equal to (`a[x-1] + 1`) % `n`, `t2` is an integer equal to (`a[x-1] + 2`) % `n`, `gaps` is a sorted list containing at least one integer, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[(x-1 + 1) % x] + (n if x-1 == x - 1 else 0)`, `gap` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, and `pairs` is an integer equal to `gap // 2`. The current value of `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`***
