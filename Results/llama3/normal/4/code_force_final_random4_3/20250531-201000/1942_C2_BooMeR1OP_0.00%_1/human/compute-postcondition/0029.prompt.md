Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer equal to 0, `y` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers from 0 to `n-1`, `present` is a set of `n` distinct integers from 0 to `n-1`, `ans` is an integer equal to 0, `i` is 0, `t1` is an integer equal to (a[0] + 1) % `n`, `t2` is an integer equal to (a[0] + 2) % `n`, `gaps` is an empty list, stdin contains `t-1` test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    next_elem = a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)
    gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
    if gap > 0:
        gaps.append(gap)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer between 0 and n, a is a sorted list of n distinct integers from 0 to n-1, present is a set of n distinct integers from 0 to n-1, ans is an integer equal to 0, i is 0, t1 is an integer equal to (a[0] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[0] + 2) % n, gaps is a list containing one or two integers, the first integer is equal to (a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)) - a[i] - 1, and if the current value of gap is greater than 0, the second integer is equal to the current value of gap, stdin contains t-1 test cases, next_elem is an integer equal to a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0), and the current value of gap is an integer greater than or equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers from 0 to `n-1`, `present` is a set of `n` distinct integers from 0 to `n-1`, `ans` is an integer equal to 0, `i` is 1, `t1` is an integer equal to (`a[1] + 1`) % `n`, `t2` is an integer equal to (`a[1] + 2`) % `n`, `gaps` is a list containing one or two integers, the first integer is equal to (`a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`) - `a[i]` - 1, and if the current value of `gap` is greater than 0, the second integer is equal to the current value of `gap`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`, and the current value of `gap` is an integer greater than or equal to 0. If `gap` is greater than 0, `gaps` contains two integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than 2, `y` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers from 0 to `n-1`, `present` is a set of `n` distinct integers from 0 to `n-1`, `ans` is an integer equal to 0, `i` is 2, `t1` is an integer equal to (`a[1] + 1`) % `n`, `t2` is an integer equal to (`a[1] + 2`) % `n`, `gaps` is a list containing one or two integers, the first integer is equal to (`a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`) - `a[i] - 1`, and if the current value of gap is greater than 0, the second integer is equal to the current value of gap, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`, and the current value of gap is an integer greater than or equal to 0. If gap is greater than 0, gaps contains two integers.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
