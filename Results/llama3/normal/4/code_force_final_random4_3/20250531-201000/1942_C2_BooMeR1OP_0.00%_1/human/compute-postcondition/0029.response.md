Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `y` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers from 0 to `n-1`, `present` is a set of `n` distinct integers from 0 to `n-1`, `ans` is an integer equal to 0, `i` is equal to `x`, `t1` is an integer equal to (`a[x-1] + 1`) % `n`, `t2` is an integer equal to (`a[x-1] + 2`) % `n`, `gaps` is a list containing one or two integers, the first integer is equal to (`a[(x-1 + 1) % x] + (n if x-1 == x - 1 else 0)`) - `a[x-1] - 1`, and if the current value of `gap` is greater than 0, the second integer is equal to the current value of `gap`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[(x-1 + 1) % x] + (n if x-1 == x - 1 else 0)`, and the current value of `gap` is an integer greater than or equal to 0. If `gap` is greater than 0, `gaps` contains two integers.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `n` remains unchanged, still between 4 and 10^9.
* The value of `x` is now greater than or equal to 0, indicating that the loop has executed at least once.
* The value of `y` remains unchanged, still between 0 and `n`.
* The list `a` remains unchanged, still a sorted list of `n` distinct integers from 0 to `n-1`.
* The set `present` remains unchanged, still a set of `n` distinct integers from 0 to `n-1`.
* The value of `ans` remains unchanged, still equal to 0.
* The value of `i` is now equal to `x`, indicating that the loop has executed `x` times.
* The values of `t1` and `t2` are updated to reflect the last element of the list `a`.
* The list `gaps` contains one or two integers, depending on the value of `gap`. If `gap` is greater than 0, `gaps` contains two integers.
* The value of `next_elem` is updated to reflect the last element of the list `a`.
* The value of `gap` is an integer greater than or equal to 0.
* The contents of `stdin` remain unchanged, still containing `t-1` test cases.
