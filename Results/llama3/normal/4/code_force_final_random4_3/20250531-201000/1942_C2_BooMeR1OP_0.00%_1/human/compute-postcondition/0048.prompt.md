Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `y` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers from 0 to `n-1`, `present` is a set of `n` distinct integers from 0 to `n-1`, `ans` is an integer equal to 0, `i` is equal to `x`, `t1` is an integer equal to (`a[x-1] + 1`) % `n`, `t2` is an integer equal to (`a[x-1] + 2`) % `n`, `gaps` is a sorted list containing one or two integers, the first integer is equal to (`a[(x-1 + 1) % x] + (n if x-1 == x - 1 else 0)`) - `a[x-1] - 1`, and if the current value of `gap` is greater than 0, the second integer is equal to the current value of `gap`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[(x-1 + 1) % x] + (n if x-1 == x - 1 else 0)`, and the current value of `gap` is an integer greater than or equal to 0. If `gap` is greater than 0, `gaps` contains two integers.
Code of the loop:
for gap in gaps:
    pairs = gap // 2
    if y >= pairs:
        ans += gap
        y -= pairs
    else:
        ans += 2 * y
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer greater than or equal to 0, y is an integer between 0 and n, a is a sorted list of n distinct integers from 0 to n-1, present is a set of n distinct integers from 0 to n-1, i is equal to x, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x-1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x-1] + 2) % n, gaps is a sorted list containing at least one integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases, next_elem is an integer equal to a[(x-1 + 1) % x] + (n if x-1 == x - 1 else 0), gap is an integer greater than or equal to 0, and pairs is an integer equal to gap // 2. If y is greater than or equal to pairs, then ans is an integer equal to gap. Otherwise, ans is an integer equal to 2*y.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `y` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers from 0 to `n-1`, `present` is a set of `n` distinct integers from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is equal to `x`, `t1` is an integer equal to `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is an integer equal to `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `gaps` is a sorted list containing at least two integers, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[(x-1 + 1) % x] + (n if x-1 == x - 1 else 0)`, `gap` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and is the next integer in the list `gaps`, and `pairs` is an integer equal to `gap // 2`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`, then `ans` is an integer equal to `ans + gap` and `y` is an integer equal to `y - pairs`. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer equal to `ans + 2*y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer greater than or equal to 0, y is an integer between 0 and n, a is a sorted list of n distinct integers from 0 to n-1, present is a set of n distinct integers from 0 to n-1, i is equal to x, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x-1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x-1] + 2) % n, gaps is a sorted list containing at least one integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases, next_elem is an integer equal to a[(x-1 + 1) % x] + (n if x-1 == x - 1 else 0), pairs is an integer equal to gap // 2. If y is greater than or equal to pairs, ans is an integer equal to its original value plus gap, and y is an integer equal to its original value minus pairs. Otherwise, ans is an integer equal to its original value plus 2*y.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
