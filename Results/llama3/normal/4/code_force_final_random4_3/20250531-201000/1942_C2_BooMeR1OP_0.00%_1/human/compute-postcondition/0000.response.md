Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is an integer between 0 and n - x, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 0 to n-1, present is a set of x distinct integers from 0 to n-1, ans is an integer equal to x - 2.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decremented by 1 because one test case has been processed. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` have been updated based on the input values. The list `a` contains `x` distinct integers from 0 to `n-1`, which are sorted in ascending order. The set `present` contains the same integers as the list `a`. The variable `ans` has been initialized to `x - 2`.
