Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer between 0 and n - x + 1, `a` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 0 to n-1, `present` is a set of x distinct integers from 0 to n-1, `ans` is an integer equal to x if t1 is not in present and t2 is in present, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 1, `i` is 2, `t1` is an integer equal to (a[i] + 1) % n, `t2` is an integer equal to (a[i] + 2) % n, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now either `x` or `x - 1`, depending on whether `t1` is in `present` and `t2` is in `present`. The rest of the variables maintain their initial values and ranges.
