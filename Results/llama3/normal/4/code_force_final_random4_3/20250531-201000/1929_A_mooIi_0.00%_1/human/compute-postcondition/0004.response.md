The only objects in the loop head are variables  _ and stdin, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the stdin.  If the stdin has at least t test cases the loop executes again for the tth time. At the end of the last iteration, stdin has t-1 test cases, _ is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the stdin must have t test cases and the _ is 1.
State: **n is an integer equal to the input integer, ar is a list of strings representing the sorted input integers, stdin contains t test cases, _ is 1, and the sorted input integers are printed as a string separated by spaces**
