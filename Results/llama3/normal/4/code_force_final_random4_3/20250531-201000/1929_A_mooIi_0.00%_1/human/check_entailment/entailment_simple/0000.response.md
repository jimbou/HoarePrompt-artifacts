Reasoning:

The given program is supposed to calculate the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. However, the program does not actually calculate this sum. Instead, it sorts the input integers and prints them as a string separated by spaces.

The program does not perform the required calculation, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. It only sorts the input integers and prints them, without calculating the maximum beauty.

Correctness: **False**
