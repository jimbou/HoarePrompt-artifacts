To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The variables in the loop head are `_` and `int(input())`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is greater than the current value of `_`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `int(input())` is equal to the first input integer.

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `int(input())` must be greater than the new value of `_`. Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input integer, `ar` is a list of strings representing the sorted input integers, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases, `_` is 2, and the sorted input integers are printed as a string separated by spaces, and this is printed: a string of sorted input integers separated by spaces**

Note that the value of `t` is not explicitly mentioned in the state, but it can be inferred that `t` is the total number of test cases, and `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases at the start of the next iteration.
