Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input integer, ar is a list of strings representing the sorted input integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 1, and the sorted input integers are printed as a string separated by spaces**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the first input integer, and `ar` now contains a list of strings representing the sorted input integers. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1, and the value of `_` remains unchanged. The sorted input integers are printed as a string separated by spaces.
