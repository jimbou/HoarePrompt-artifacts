Output State: **n is an integer equal to the last input integer, ar is a list of strings representing the sorted input integers, stdin contains 0 test cases, _ is t-1, and the sorted input integers are printed as a string separated by spaces, and this is printed: t-1 strings of sorted input integers separated by spaces.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable n will hold the value of the last input integer, the list ar will contain the sorted input integers as strings, there will be no more test cases left in the standard input (stdin), the loop counter _ will be equal to t-1 (where t is the initial number of test cases), and the sorted input integers will be printed as a string separated by spaces. Additionally, t-1 strings of sorted input integers separated by spaces will be printed, representing the output of each test case.
