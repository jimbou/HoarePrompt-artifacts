Output State: **n is an integer equal to the input integer, ar is a list of strings representing the sorted input integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0**

In this output state, the value of `n` is the integer input from stdin, which is between 2 and 100 (inclusive). The variable `ar` is a list of strings, where each string represents a sorted integer from the input. The sorting is done in ascending order. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases, as only one test case has been processed. The variable `_` remains unchanged at 0.
