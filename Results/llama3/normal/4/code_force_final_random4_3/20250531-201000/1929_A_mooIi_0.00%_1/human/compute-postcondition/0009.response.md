Output State: **n is an integer equal to the second input integer, ar is a list of strings representing the sorted input integers, stdin contains t-3 test cases, _ is 2, and the sorted input integers are printed as a string separated by spaces, and this is printed: a string of sorted input integers separated by spaces**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the second input integer. The list `ar` now contains the sorted input integers as strings. The number of test cases in `stdin` has decreased by one. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 2. The sorted input integers are printed as a string separated by spaces, and this is printed: a string of sorted input integers separated by spaces.
