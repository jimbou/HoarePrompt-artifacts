Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, but the program simply sorts the array and prints it. This does not take into account the differences between consecutive elements.

For example, if the input is [3, 1, 2], the program will output [1, 2, 3], but the maximum beauty of the array is actually 2, which can be achieved by rearranging the elements to [1, 3, 2].

To correctly solve the problem, the program should sort the array and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. Here is an example of a correct solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        beauty = sum(ar[i] - ar[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the elements and then summing the differences between consecutive elements.
