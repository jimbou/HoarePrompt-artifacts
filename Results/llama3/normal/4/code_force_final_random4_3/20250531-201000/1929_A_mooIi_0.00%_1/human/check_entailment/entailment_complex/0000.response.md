Reasoning:

The given Python program is supposed to calculate the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

However, the provided program does not calculate the beauty of the array. Instead, it sorts the input integers in ascending order and prints them as a string separated by spaces.

The program does not perform the required calculation, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. It only sorts the input integers and prints them.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect for the problem described.

Correctness: **False**
