Reasoning:
The provided Python program is not correct based on the given problem description. The problem asks to find the maximum beauty of the array, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the array after rearranging them in any way. However, the program simply sorts the array in ascending order and prints it as a string separated by spaces. It does not calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The correct solution would involve sorting the array and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. The maximum beauty of the array would be the sum of these differences.

Correctness: **False**
