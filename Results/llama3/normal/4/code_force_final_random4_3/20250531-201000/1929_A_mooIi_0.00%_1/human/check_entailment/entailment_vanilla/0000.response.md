Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

However, the program is not correctly solving the problem. The program is sorting the array in ascending order and then printing the sorted array. This is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

The correct approach would be to find the maximum and minimum elements in the array and then calculate the beauty of the array by subtracting the minimum element from the maximum element.

Here is the correct code:

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ar.sort()
        beauty = ar[-1] - ar[0]
        print(beauty)

Correctness: **False**
