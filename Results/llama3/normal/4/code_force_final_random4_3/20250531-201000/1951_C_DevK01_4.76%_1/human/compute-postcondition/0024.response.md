The code prints the calculated cost based on the given conditions.

If n times m equals k, then the cost is m times the sum of N plus m squared times the sum of integers from 1 to n-1.

Otherwise, the cost is mu times w plus m times the sum of N plus m squared times the sum of integers from 1 to n-2 plus n times m times mu.

Since the exact values of n, m, k, N, and q are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of cost. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated cost.

Output: **cost (where cost is the calculated cost based on the given conditions)**
