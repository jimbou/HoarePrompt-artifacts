The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two lines of input, the first line of the first test case is read and assigned to `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines of input: the first line contains three integers n, m, and k, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.**
