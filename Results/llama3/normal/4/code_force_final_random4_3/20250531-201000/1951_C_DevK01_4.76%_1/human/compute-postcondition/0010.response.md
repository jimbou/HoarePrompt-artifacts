Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `n` is the length of the list `N`, `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`, `k` is an integer, `N` is a list of `q` integers from the sorted list `M`, `q` is the ceiling of `k` divided by `m`, `M` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `L` is a list of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, `_` is 0. If `n` times `m` equals `k`, then `cost` is `m` times the sum of `N` plus `m` squared times the sum of integers from 1 to `n` minus 1 times `n` divided by 2. Otherwise, `n` is the length of the list `N` minus one, `N` is a list of `q-1` integers from the sorted list `M`, and `cost` is the sum of `mu` times `w`, `m` times the sum of the remaining integers in `N`, `m` squared times the sum of integers from 1 to the original length of `N` minus two, and `n` times `m` times `mu`, where `mu` is `k` minus `m` times the original length of `N` minus one, and `w` is the last integer in the original list `N`, and the cost is printed. We skip the rest of the code inside the current loop or if statement and move to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state because the `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the current loop or if statement and moves to the next iteration of the loop, without changing any variable values.
