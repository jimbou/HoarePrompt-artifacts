Output State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, n is the length of N, m is the minimum of the original m and k, k is an integer, M is a sorted list of n integers, L is a list of three integers n, m, and k, _ is 2, stdin is empty, N is a list of q integers, q is the ceiling of k divided by m, cost is m times the sum of N plus m squared times the sum of integers from 1 to n-1**

In this output state, the value of `cost` has been calculated based on the given variables `m`, `n`, and `N`. The other variables remain unchanged. The expression `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` calculates the cost by multiplying `m` with the sum of the integers in `N`, and adding it to the product of `m` squared and the sum of integers from 1 to `n-1`.
