The code prints the calculated cost based on the given conditions.

If n * m equals k, then the cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2), where N is a list of q integers from the sorted list M and q is the ceiling of k divided by m.

Otherwise, the cost is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu, where w is the last element of the original list N, mu is k - (n - 1) * m, and N is a list of q-1 integers from the sorted list M.

Since the exact values of n, m, k, M, and other variables are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of cost. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated cost.

Output: **cost (where cost is the calculated cost based on the given conditions and variables)**
