Output State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, n is the length of N minus 1, m is the minimum of the original m and k, k is an integer, M is a sorted list of n integers, L is a list of three integers n, m, and k, _ is 2, stdin is empty, N is a list of q-1 integers, q is the ceiling of k divided by m, w is the last integer in the original N, mu is k minus (n-1) times m, cost is mu times w plus m times the sum of N plus m squared times the sum of integers from 1 to n-2 plus n times m times mu.**

The code modifies the values of `n`, `N`, `w`, `mu`, and `cost`. The value of `n` is updated to be the length of `N` minus 1, since one element is removed from `N` by the `pop()` operation. The value of `N` is updated to be a list of `q-1` integers, since one element is removed. The value of `w` is set to the last integer in the original `N`. The value of `mu` is calculated as `k` minus `(n-1)` times `m`. The value of `cost` is calculated as the sum of several terms: `mu` times `w`, `m` times the sum of `N`, `m` squared times the sum of integers from 1 to `n-2`, and `n` times `m` times `mu`. The other variables remain unchanged.
