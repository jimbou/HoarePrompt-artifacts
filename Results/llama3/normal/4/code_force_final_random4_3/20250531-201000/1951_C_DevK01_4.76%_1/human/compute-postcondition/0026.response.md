Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`, `k` is an integer, `M` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `L` is a list of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, `_` is 2, `N` is a list of `q` integers, `q` is the ceiling of `k` divided by `m`. If `n` times `m` equals `k`, then `cost` is `m` times the sum of `N` plus `m` squared times the sum of integers from 1 to `n-1`. Otherwise, `n` is the length of `N` minus 1, `N` is a list of `q-1` integers, `w` is the last integer in the original `N`, `mu` is `k` minus `(n-1)` times `m`, and `cost` is `mu` times `w` plus `m` times the sum of `N` plus `m` squared times the sum of integers from 1 to `n-2` plus `n` times `m` times `mu`, and `cost` is printed. We skip the current iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with no changes to the variables. The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of the loop, but does not affect the values of the variables.
