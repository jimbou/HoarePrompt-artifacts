Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases t and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of n, m, and k, and then reads the prices per ticket for each day.
3. It sorts the prices in ascending order, which is correct because we want to buy tickets on the days with the lowest prices first.
4. It calculates the minimum number of days q required to buy k tickets, which is the ceiling of k divided by m.
5. It then calculates the cost of buying tickets on the first q-1 days, which is the sum of the prices of these days multiplied by m, plus the additional cost due to the price increase on subsequent days.
6. If k is not exactly divisible by m, it calculates the cost of buying the remaining tickets on the last day, which is the price of the last day multiplied by the remaining number of tickets.
7. Finally, it prints the total cost for each test case.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when k is exactly divisible by m, and when k is not exactly divisible by m. It also correctly calculates the additional cost due to the price increase on subsequent days.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
