The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1 and `t` must be decreased by 1.
State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `n` is the length of the list `N`, `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`, `k` is an integer, `N` is a list of `q` integers from the sorted list `M`, `q` is the ceiling of `k` divided by `m`, `M` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `L` is a list of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, `_` is 1, `cost` is not defined**
