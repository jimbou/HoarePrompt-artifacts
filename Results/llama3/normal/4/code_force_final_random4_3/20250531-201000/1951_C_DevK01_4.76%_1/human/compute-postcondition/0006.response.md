Output State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, n is the length of the list N minus one, m is the minimum of the original m and k, k is an integer, N is a list of q-1 integers from the sorted list M, q is the ceiling of k divided by m, M is a sorted list of n integers, L is a list of three integers n, m, and k, _ is 0, and n times m is not equal to k, w is the last integer in the original list N, mu is k minus m times the original length of N minus one, cost is the sum of mu times w, m times the sum of the remaining integers in N, m squared times the sum of integers from 1 to the original length of N minus two, and n times m times mu.**

The code executes the following operations:

1. `w = N.pop()`: Removes the last integer from the list N and assigns it to the variable w.
2. `mu = k - (n - 1) * m`: Calculates the value of mu as k minus m times the original length of N minus one.
3. `cost = mu * w`: Initializes the cost variable as the product of mu and w.
4. `n = len(N)`: Updates the value of n to be the length of the list N minus one.
5. `cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`: Updates the cost variable by adding the sum of m times the sum of the remaining integers in N, m squared times the sum of integers from 1 to the original length of N minus two, and n times m times mu.

The final state includes all the variables and their updated values, as well as the remaining information from the precondition that is still valid after the code execution.
