Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than or equal to 0, stdin is empty, `_` is `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `L`, `N`, `q`, `w`, `mu`, and `cost` are undefined.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the number of test cases `t` is greater than or equal to 0, the standard input `stdin` is empty, and the loop counter `_` is equal to `t`. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `L`, `N`, `q`, `w`, `mu`, and `cost` are undefined because they are local to the loop and are no longer accessible after the loop finishes executing.
