Output State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, n is q, m is the minimum of the original m and k, k is an integer, N is a list of q integers from the sorted list M, q is the ceiling of k divided by m, M is a sorted list of n integers, L is a list of three integers n, m, and k, _ is 1, cost is not defined, stdin is empty**

The code first reads a list of three integers from stdin and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. Then, it reads a list of `n` integers from stdin, sorts them, and assigns the first `q` integers to `N`, where `q` is the ceiling of `k` divided by `m`. The value of `n` is updated to be the length of `N`, which is `q`. The value of `m` is updated to be the minimum of the original `m` and `k`. The value of `k` remains unchanged. The list `L` is updated to contain the new values of `n`, `m`, and `k`. The variable `_` is not affected by the code and remains 1. The variable `cost` is not defined in the initial state and remains undefined after the code execution. Stdin is empty after the code execution.
