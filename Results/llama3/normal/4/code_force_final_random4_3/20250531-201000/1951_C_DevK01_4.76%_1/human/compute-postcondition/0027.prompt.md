Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines of input: the first line contains three integers n, m, and k, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    M = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
    m = min(m, k)
    M.sort()
    q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
    N = M[:q]
    n = len(N)
    if n * m == k:
        cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
    else:
        w = N.pop()
        mu = k - (n - 1) * m
        cost = mu * w
        n = len(N)
        cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu
    print(cost)
    continue


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `n` is the length of the list `N`, `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`, `k` is an integer, `N` is a list of `q` integers from the sorted list `M`, `q` is the ceiling of `k` divided by `m`, `M` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `L` is a list of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, `_` is 0. If `n` times `m` equals `k`, then `cost` is `m` times the sum of `N` plus `m` squared times the sum of integers from 1 to `n` minus 1 times `n` divided by 2. Otherwise, `n` is the length of the list `N` minus one, `N` is a list of `q-1` integers from the sorted list `M`, and `cost` is the sum of `mu` times `w`, `m` times the sum of the remaining integers in `N`, `m` squared times the sum of integers from 1 to the original length of `N` minus two, and `n` times `m` times `mu`, where `mu` is `k` minus `m` times the original length of `N` minus one, and `w` is the last integer in the original list `N`, and the cost is printed. We skip the rest of the code inside the current loop or if statement and move to the next iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is q, `m` is the minimum of the original m and k, `k` is an integer, `M` is a sorted list of n integers, `L` is a list of three integers n, m, and k, `_` is 1, stdin is empty, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`, `k` is an integer, `M` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `L` is a list of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, `_` is 2, `N` is a list of `q` integers, `q` is the ceiling of `k` divided by `m`. If `n` times `m` equals `k`, then `cost` is `m` times the sum of `N` plus `m` squared times the sum of integers from 1 to `n-1`. Otherwise, `n` is the length of `N` minus 1, `N` is a list of `q-1` integers, `w` is the last integer in the original `N`, `mu` is `k` minus `(n-1)` times `m`, and `cost` is `mu` times `w` plus `m` times the sum of `N` plus `m` squared times the sum of integers from 1 to `n-2` plus `n` times `m` times `mu`, and `cost` is printed. We skip the current iteration of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
