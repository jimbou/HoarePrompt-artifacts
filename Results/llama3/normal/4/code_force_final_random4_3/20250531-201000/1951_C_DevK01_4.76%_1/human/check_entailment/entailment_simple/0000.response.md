Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, given the constraints of the problem. The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of sale days (n), the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m), and the number of tickets to be bought at the end (k). It also reads the prices per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

The program then sorts the prices in ascending order and calculates the minimum number of days (q) required to buy k tickets, considering the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m). It then calculates the cost of buying tickets on each day, taking into account the increase in price due to the purchase of tickets on previous days.

The program handles two cases: when the total number of tickets to be bought is exactly divisible by the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m), and when it is not. In the first case, it calculates the cost by multiplying the sum of prices of the first q days by m, and adding the cost of the increase in price due to the purchase of tickets on previous days. In the second case, it calculates the cost by multiplying the price of the last day by the remaining number of tickets to be bought, and adding the cost of buying tickets on the previous days.

The program prints the calculated cost for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
