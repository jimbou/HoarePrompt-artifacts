Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `n` is the length of the list `N`, `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`, `k` is an integer, `N` is a list of `q` integers from the sorted list `M`, `q` is the ceiling of `k` divided by `m`, `M` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `L` is a list of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, `_` is 0, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`, and the current value of `n` times `m` equals `k`.**

In this output state, the value of `cost` is calculated based on the values of `m`, `N`, `n`, and the relationship between `n` and `m` is maintained as `n` times `m` equals `k`. The other variables remain unchanged, and their values are still valid as specified in the initial state.
