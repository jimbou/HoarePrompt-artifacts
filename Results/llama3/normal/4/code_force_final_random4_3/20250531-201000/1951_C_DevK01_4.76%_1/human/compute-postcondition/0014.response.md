Output State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, n is the number of elements in the list N after popping one element, m is the minimum of the original m and k, k is an integer, N is a list of q-1 integers from the sorted list M, q is the ceiling of k divided by m, M is a sorted list of n integers, L is a list of three integers n, m, and k, _ is 1, cost is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu, w is the last element of the original list N, mu is k - (n - 1) * m, stdin is empty**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The number of test cases `t` remains unchanged. The value of `n` is now the number of elements in the list `N` after one element has been removed. The values of `m`, `k`, `q`, `M`, `L`, and `_` remain unchanged. The list `N` has been modified by removing one element, and the variable `w` now holds the value of the last element that was removed. The variable `mu` has been calculated as `k - (n - 1) * m`. The variable `cost` has been calculated based on the values of `mu`, `w`, `m`, `n`, and the sum of the remaining elements in `N`. The standard input `stdin` remains empty.
