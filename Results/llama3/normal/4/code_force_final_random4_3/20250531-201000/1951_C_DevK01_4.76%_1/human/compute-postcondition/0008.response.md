Based on the precondition, the value of `cost` depends on the condition `n times m equals k`. If this condition is true, then `cost` is calculated as `m times the sum of N plus m squared times the sum of integers from 1 to n minus 1 times n divided by 2`. Otherwise, `cost` is calculated as `the sum of mu times w, m times the sum of the remaining integers in N, m squared times the sum of integers from 1 to the original length of N minus two, and n times m times mu`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `N`, and `M` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `cost`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated cost.

Output: **cost (where cost is the calculated cost based on the condition n times m equals k and the values of n, m, k, N, and M)**
