Output State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, n is q, m is the minimum of the original m and k, k is an integer, N is a list of q integers from the sorted list M, q is the ceiling of k divided by m, M is a sorted list of n integers, L is a list of three integers n, m, and k, _ is 1, cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2), stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `cost` has been defined and calculated based on the values of `m`, `N`, and `n`. The other variables remain unchanged, and their values are still valid as specified in the initial state. The `cost` variable now holds the result of the calculation `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`, which is a specific value based on the values of `m`, `N`, and `n`.
