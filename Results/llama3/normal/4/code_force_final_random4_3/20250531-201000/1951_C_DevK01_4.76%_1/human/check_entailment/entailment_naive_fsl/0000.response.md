Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets. The problem description states that the price per ticket increases by x if x tickets are purchased on day i, but the program does not take this into account. It simply sorts the prices and calculates the cost based on the sorted prices, without considering the increase in price due to previous purchases.

For example, consider the input:

4 2 3
8 6 4 2

The program will sort the prices as [2, 4, 6, 8] and calculate the cost as 2*2 + 2*4 + 2*6 = 24. However, this is not the correct solution. The correct solution would be to buy 1 ticket on day 3 with cost 4, and then buy 2 tickets on day 4 with cost 6, resulting in a total cost of 10.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
