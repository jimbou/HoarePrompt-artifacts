Postcondition: ***t is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, n is q, m is the minimum of the original m and k, k is an integer, M is a sorted list of n integers, L is a list of three integers n, m, and k, _ is 1, stdin is empty. If n * m equals k, then cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2), where N is a list of q integers from the sorted list M and q is the ceiling of k divided by m. Otherwise, cost is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu, where w is the last element of the original list N, mu is k - (n - 1) * m, and N is a list of q-1 integers from the sorted list M.***
