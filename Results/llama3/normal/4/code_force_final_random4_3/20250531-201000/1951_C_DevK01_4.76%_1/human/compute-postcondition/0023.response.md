Postcondition: ***t is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, n is the length of N, m is the minimum of the original m and k, k is an integer, M is a sorted list of n integers, L is a list of three integers n, m, and k, _ is 2, stdin is empty, N is a list of q integers, q is the ceiling of k divided by m. If n times m equals k, then cost is m times the sum of N plus m squared times the sum of integers from 1 to n-1. Otherwise, n is the length of N minus 1, N is a list of q-1 integers, w is the last integer in the original N, mu is k minus (n-1) times m, and cost is mu times w plus m times the sum of N plus m squared times the sum of integers from 1 to n-2 plus n times m times mu.***
