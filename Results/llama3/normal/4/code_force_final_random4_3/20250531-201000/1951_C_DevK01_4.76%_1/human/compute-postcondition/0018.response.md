Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is q, `m` is the minimum of the original m and k, `k` is an integer, `M` is a sorted list of n integers, `L` is a list of three integers n, m, and k, `_` is 1, stdin is empty, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. No variables have changed values, and the stdin remains empty.
