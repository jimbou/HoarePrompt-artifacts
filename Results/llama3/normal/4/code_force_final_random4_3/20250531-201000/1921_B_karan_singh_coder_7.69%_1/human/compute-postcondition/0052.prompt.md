Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5), the second line contains a string s of n characters where each character is either '1' or '0', and the third line contains a string f of n characters where each character is either '1' or '0'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    t = input()
    s1 = s.count('1')
    t1 = t.count('1')
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        cnt += s[i] != t[i]
    if s1 == t1:
        print(s1 if cnt else 0)
    else:
        d = abs(s1 - t1)
        print((cnt - d) // 2 + d)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `i` is `n-1`. If the number of '1' characters in `s` is equal to the number of '1' characters in `t`, then the number of '1' characters in `s` is printed if `cnt` is not zero, otherwise 0 is printed. If the number of '1' characters in `s` is not equal to the number of '1' characters in `t`, then the value of `(cnt - d) // 2 + d` is printed, where `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `i` is `n-1`. If `s1` is equal to `t1`, then the number of '1' characters in `s` is printed if `cnt` is not zero, otherwise 0 is printed. If `s1` is not equal to `t1`, then the result of the expression `(cnt - d) // 2 + d` is printed, where `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is the number of positions where `s` and `t` differ, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 input. If `s1` equals `t1`, the number of '1' characters in `s` is printed if `s` and `t` differ in at least one position, otherwise 0 is printed. If `s1` does not equal `t1`, the minimum number of operations required to make `s` and `t` equal is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
