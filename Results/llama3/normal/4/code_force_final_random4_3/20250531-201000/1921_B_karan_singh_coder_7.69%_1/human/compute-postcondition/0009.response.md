Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `i` is `n-1`. The current value of `s1` is equal to the current value of `t1`.**
