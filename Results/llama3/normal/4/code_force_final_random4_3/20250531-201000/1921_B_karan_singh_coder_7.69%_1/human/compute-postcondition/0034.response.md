Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `i` is `n-1`. If `s1` is equal to `t1`, then the number of '1' characters in `s` is printed if `cnt` is not zero, otherwise 0 is printed. If `s1` is not equal to `t1`, then the result of the expression `(cnt - d) // 2 + d` is printed, where `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.***
