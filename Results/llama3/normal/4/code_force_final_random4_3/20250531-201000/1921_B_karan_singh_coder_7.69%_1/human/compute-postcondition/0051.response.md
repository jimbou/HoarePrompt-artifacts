Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is the number of positions where `s` and `t` differ, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 input. If `s1` equals `t1`, the number of '1' characters in `s` is printed if `s` and `t` differ in at least one position, otherwise 0 is printed. If `s1` does not equal `t1`, the minimum number of operations required to make `s` and `t` equal is printed***
