The code prints the value of `s1` if `cnt` is not zero, otherwise it prints 0. Since `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n` (inclusive), and `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, the print statement will output the number of '1' characters in `s` if `cnt` is not zero, otherwise it will output 0.
Output: **the number of '1' characters in s if cnt is not zero, otherwise 0**
