Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `i` is `n-1`, `s1` is not equal to `t1`, and `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.**

In this output state, the value of `d` is the absolute difference between the number of '1' characters in strings `s` and `t`, which is calculated using the `abs` function. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
