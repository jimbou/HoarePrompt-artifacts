Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is the number of positions where `s` and `t` differ, `_` is 2, `d` is the absolute difference between the number of '1' characters in `s` and `t`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 input. The number of '1' characters in `s` is not equal to the number of '1' characters in `t`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The variables `n`, `i`, `s`, `t`, `s1`, `t1`, `cnt`, and `_` retain their initial values. A new variable `d` is introduced, which represents the absolute difference between the number of '1' characters in strings `s` and `t`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1 input. The condition that the number of '1' characters in `s` is not equal to the number of '1' characters in `t` remains true.
