Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is either 0, 1 or 2, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**

The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1 if the characters at index `i` in strings `s` and `t` are not equal. Since `i` is 1, it compares the second characters of `s` and `t`. If they are different, `cnt` becomes 1 or 2, otherwise it remains 0 or 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
