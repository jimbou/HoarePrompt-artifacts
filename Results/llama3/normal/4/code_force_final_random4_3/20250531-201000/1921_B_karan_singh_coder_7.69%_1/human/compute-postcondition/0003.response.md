Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `i` is 0**

The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1 if the characters at index `i` in strings `s` and `t` are different. Since `i` is 0, it compares the first characters of `s` and `t`. If they are the same, `cnt` remains 0; if they are different, `cnt` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
