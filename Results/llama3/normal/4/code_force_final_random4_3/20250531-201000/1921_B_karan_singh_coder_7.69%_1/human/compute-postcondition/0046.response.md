Output: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is the number of positions where `s` and `t` differ, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 input. The current value of `s1` is equal to the current value of `t1`, and this is printed: the number of '1' characters in `s` if `s` and `t` differ in at least one position, otherwise 0**
