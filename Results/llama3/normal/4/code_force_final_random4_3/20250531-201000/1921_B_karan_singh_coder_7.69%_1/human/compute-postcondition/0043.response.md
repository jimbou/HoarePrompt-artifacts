Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is the number of positions where `s` and `t` differ, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 input**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of `i` will be one less than the initial value of `n`, and the value of `cnt` will be the total number of positions where the strings `s` and `t` differ. The other variables remain unchanged.
