Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is either 0, 1, 2 or 3 (depending on whether `s[0]` is equal to `t[0]`, `s[1]` is equal to `t[1]` and `s[3]` is equal to `t[3]`), `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `i` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been updated to reflect the comparison between the characters at index 3 of strings `s` and `t`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `cnt` can now be 0, 1, 2, or 3, depending on the equality of the characters at indices 0, 1, and 3 of strings `s` and `t`.
