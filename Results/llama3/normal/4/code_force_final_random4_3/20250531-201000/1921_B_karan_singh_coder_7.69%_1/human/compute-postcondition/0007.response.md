Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is either 1, 2 or 3, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `i` is 2**

The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the characters at index `i` in strings `s` and `t` are different, otherwise it remains the same. Since `i` is 2, the characters at index 2 in `s` and `t` are compared. The values of the other variables are not affected.
