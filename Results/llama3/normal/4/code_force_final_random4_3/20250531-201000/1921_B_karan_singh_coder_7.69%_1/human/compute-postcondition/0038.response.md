Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` is either 0 or 1 because `s[i] != t[i]` is a boolean expression that evaluates to either True (1) or False (0). The value of `i` is still 0, and the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.
