Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `i` is `n-1`**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same characteristics as the initial state, except for the variables affected by the loop. The loop counter `i` will be equal to `n-1`, and the `cnt` variable will hold the total number of positions where `s` and `t` differ, which can be any value between 0 and `n` (inclusive), depending on the actual strings `s` and `t`.
