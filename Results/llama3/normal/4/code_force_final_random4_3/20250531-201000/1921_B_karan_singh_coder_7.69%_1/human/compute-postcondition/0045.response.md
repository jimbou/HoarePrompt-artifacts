The code prints the value of `s1` if `cnt` is not zero, otherwise it prints 0. Since `cnt` is the number of positions where `s` and `t` differ, and the current value of `s1` is equal to the current value of `t1`, it means that `s` and `t` have the same number of '1' characters. If `cnt` is not zero, it means that `s` and `t` differ in at least one position, so `s1` will be printed. If `cnt` is zero, it means that `s` and `t` are identical, so 0 will be printed.
Output: **s1 (which is the number of '1' characters in s) if cnt is not zero, otherwise 0**
