Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `i` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the following characteristics:

*   `n` will be the same integer greater than or equal to 0 as in the initial state.
*   `s` and `t` will remain the same strings as in the initial state.
*   `s1` and `t1` will still represent the number of '1' characters in strings `s` and `t`, respectively.
*   `cnt` will be an integer between 0 and `n`, representing the total number of positions where `s` and `t` differ.
*   `_` will remain 0.
*   The stdin will still contain multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.
*   `i` will be `n-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times.
