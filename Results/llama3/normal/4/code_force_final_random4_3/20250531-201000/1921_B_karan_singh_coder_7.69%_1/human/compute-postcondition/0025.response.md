Output State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `i` is `n-1`

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `s`, `t`, `s1`, `t1`, `_`, and `stdin` as in the initial state. The value of `n` will remain the same, but `cnt` will be an integer between 0 and `n` (inclusive), depending on the number of mismatches between corresponding characters in `s` and `t`. The value of `i` will be `n-1`, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
