Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been updated based on the comparison of the characters at index `i` in strings `s` and `t`. If the characters are different, `cnt` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
