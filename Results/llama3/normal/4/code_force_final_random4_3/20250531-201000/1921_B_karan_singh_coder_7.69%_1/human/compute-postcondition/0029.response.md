The code prints the value of `s1` if `cnt` is not zero, otherwise it prints 0. Since the current value of `s1` is equal to the current value of `t1`, and `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, the printed value will be the number of '1' characters in `s` if `cnt` is not zero, otherwise it will be 0.
Output: ** `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `i` is `n-1`. The current value of `s1` is equal to the current value of `t1`. The number of '1' characters in `s` if `cnt` is not zero, otherwise 0 is being printed**
