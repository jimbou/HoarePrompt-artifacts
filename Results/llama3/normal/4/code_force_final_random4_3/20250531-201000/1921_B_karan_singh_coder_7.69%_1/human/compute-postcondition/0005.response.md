Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is either 0, 1 or 2, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `i` is 1**

The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the characters at index `i` in strings `s` and `t` are different, otherwise it remains the same. Since `i` is 1, we are comparing the second characters of `s` and `t`. The value of `cnt` can be 0, 1 or 2 depending on whether the characters at index `i` in `s` and `t` are the same or different. The values of the other variables are not affected.
