To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables in the loop head and adjust their states accordingly.


The loop head is `for i in range(n):`, which means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `n`.


At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 to get the state at the start of the next iteration.


Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:


State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is either 0, 1 or 2 (depending on whether `s[0]` is equal to `t[0]` and `s[1]` is equal to `t[1]`), `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `i` is 3**
