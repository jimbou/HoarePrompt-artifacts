Output State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `mat` is a 2D list of size n x n where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to n, `res` is 1, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: '2' followed by the value of `i` which is 0, followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`**.

Explanation: The code increments the value of `res` by `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`. Since `i` is 0, this expression evaluates to `(0 + 1) * (2 * 0 + 1) = 1`. Therefore, `res` is updated to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
