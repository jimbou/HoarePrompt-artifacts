Output State: **`n` is an integer at least 3, `mat` is a 2D list of size n x n where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to n, `res` is 1 + (1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1) + (2 + 1) * (2 * 2 + 1) = 1 + 7 + 15 = 23, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: '2' followed by the value of `i` which is 1, followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated by adding the product of `(i + 1)` and `(2 * i + 1)`, where `i` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
