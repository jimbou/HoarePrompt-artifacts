Output State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `mat` is a 2D list of size n x n where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to n, `res` is 1, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to 1, which is the result of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` where `i` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `res` is now 1, which is a specific value. The values of `n`, `mat`, `i`, and `stdin` are still valid and remain the same as in the initial state.
