Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix by using the formula `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` which is derived from the fact that the maximum sum can be achieved by placing the largest numbers in the matrix in a way that maximizes their contribution to the sum.

The program also correctly prints the maximum sum and the number of operations required to achieve this sum. The number of operations is `n << 1` which is equivalent to `2 * n`, as required by the problem statement.

The program then prints the operations required to achieve the maximum sum. For each `i` from `n` to `1`, it prints two operations: one of type `1` and one of type `2`. The permutation used in each operation is the identity permutation, which is a valid permutation as required by the problem statement.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the required output.

Correctness: **True**
