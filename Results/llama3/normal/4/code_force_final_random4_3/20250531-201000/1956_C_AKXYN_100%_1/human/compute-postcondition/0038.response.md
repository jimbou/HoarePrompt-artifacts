Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `res` is the sum of the first n squares of integers from 1 to n. This is a well-known mathematical formula, which is equal to `n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/6`.
* `n` is an integer at least 1.
* `i` is `n-1`, but it is not used in the print statement.
* `mat` is a 2D list of size n x n, but it is not used in the print statement.
* `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, but it is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is `print(res, n << 1)`. Here, `n << 1` is a bitwise left shift operation, which is equivalent to multiplying `n` by 2.

Therefore, the output will be the sum of the squares of the first `n` integers, followed by `2n`.

Output: **n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/6, 2n (where n is an integer at least 1)**
