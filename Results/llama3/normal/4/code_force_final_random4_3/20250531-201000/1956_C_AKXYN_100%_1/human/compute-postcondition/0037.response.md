Output State: `n` is an integer at least 1, `mat` is a 2D list of size n x n where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to n, `res` is the sum of the first n squares of integers from 1 to n, `i` is n - 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `res` is the sum of the squares of the first `n` integers, `i` is `n-1`, and the other variables remain unchanged.
