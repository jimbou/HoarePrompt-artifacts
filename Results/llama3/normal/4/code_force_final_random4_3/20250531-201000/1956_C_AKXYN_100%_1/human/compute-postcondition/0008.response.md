Output State: **n is an integer at least 1, mat is a 2D list of size n x n where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to n, res is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n - 1, i is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The value of `n` remains the same, the 2D list `mat` remains unchanged, the value of `res` is the sum of the products of `(i + 1)` and `(2 * i + 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 1`, the value of `i` is `n - 1`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged.
