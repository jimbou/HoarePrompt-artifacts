Output State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `mat` is a 2D list of size n x n where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to n, `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1, `i` is n-1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: '2' followed by the value of `i` which is n-1, followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `res` will be the sum of the products of `(i + 1)` and `(2 * i + 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. The value of `i` will be `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The state of the other variables, `mat`, `stdin`, and the printed output, remains unchanged.
