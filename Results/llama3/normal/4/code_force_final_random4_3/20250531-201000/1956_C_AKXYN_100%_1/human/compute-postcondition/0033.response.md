Output State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `mat` is a 2D list of size n x n where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to n, `res` is 7, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one**

The value of `res` is updated by adding `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`, where `i` is 1. So, `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` equals `(1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1)` which is `2 * 3` which is `6`. Therefore, `res` becomes `1 + 6` which is `7`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
