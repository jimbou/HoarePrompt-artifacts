The `print` statement will print the value of `res` and the result of the expression `n << 1`.

The value of `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from `0` to `n - 1`. This is a sum of quadratic terms, where each term is of the form `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`. Since `i` ranges from `0` to `n - 1`, the sum will have `n` terms.

The expression `n << 1` is a bitwise left shift operation, which is equivalent to multiplying `n` by `2`. Therefore, the result of `n << 1` will be `2 * n`.

Output: **the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n - 1, 2 * n**
