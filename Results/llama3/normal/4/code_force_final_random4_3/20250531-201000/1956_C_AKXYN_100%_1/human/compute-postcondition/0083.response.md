Output State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `mat` is a 2D list of size `n` x `n` where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to `n` - 1, `i` is 0, `stdin` is empty, the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to `n` - 1 which is equal to `res` and the value of `n` left shifted by 1 which is equal to `n` * 2 is printed for each test case, '1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1) is printed for each `i` from `n` to 1 for each test case, and '2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1) is printed for each `i` from `n` to 1 for each test case.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will be such that `n` will be an integer at least 1, `mat` will be a 2D list of size `n` x `n` where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to `n`, `res` will be the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to `n` - 1, `i` will be 0, `stdin` will be empty, and the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to `n` - 1 which is equal to `res` and the value of `n` left shifted by 1 which is equal to `n` * 2 will be printed for each test case. Additionally, '1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1) will be printed for each `i` from `n` to 1 for each test case, and '2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1) will be printed for each `i` from `n` to 1 for each test case.
