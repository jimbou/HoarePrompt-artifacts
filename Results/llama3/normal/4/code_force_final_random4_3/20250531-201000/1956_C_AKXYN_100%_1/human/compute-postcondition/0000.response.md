According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from stdin. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the input from stdin must be at least 1.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, the first test case contains an integer that must be at least 1**
