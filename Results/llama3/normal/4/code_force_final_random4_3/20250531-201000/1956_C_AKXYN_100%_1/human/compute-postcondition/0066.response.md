Output: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `mat` is a 2D list of size n x n where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to n, `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1, `i` is n-1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1 which is `res` and 2 times `n` which is `n << 1`**
