The code prints a string that starts with '2', followed by the value of `i` which is `n-2`, and then the numbers from 1 to `n`. Here, `n` is an integer at least 2, and `i` is `n-2`. The `*range(1, n + 1)` expression generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and unpacks them as separate arguments to the `print` function.

Output: **2 [n-2] 1 2 3 ... [n] (where n is an integer at least 2 and n-2 is the value of i)**
