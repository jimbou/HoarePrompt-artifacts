The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is decreased by 1 so `i` is `n-2` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 2.
State: **`n` is an integer at least 2, `mat` is a 2D list of size n x n where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to n, `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-2, `i` is n-2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: 2, the value of `i` which is `n-2` and the range of numbers from 1 to `n` which is `range(1, n + 1)`**
