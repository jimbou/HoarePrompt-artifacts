Output State: **n is an integer at least 1, mat is a 2D list of size n x n where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to n, res is 0, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: '2' followed by the value of i which is 0, followed by the numbers from 1 to n.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is updated to the integer value of the input, which is at least 1. The 2D list `mat` is created with size n x n, where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to n. The variable `res` is initialized to 0. The value of `i` remains 0. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, as one test case has been consumed by the input operation. The output includes the string '2' followed by the value of `i` (which is 0), followed by the numbers from 1 to n.
