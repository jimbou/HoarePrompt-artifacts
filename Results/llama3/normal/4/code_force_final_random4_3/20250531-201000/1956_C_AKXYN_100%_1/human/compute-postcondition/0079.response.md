The code prints a string '1' followed by the value of `i` which is `n-2`, and the range of numbers from 1 to `n` which is `range(1, n + 1)`. Where `n` is an integer at least 2, `mat` is a 2D list of size n x n where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to n, `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-2, `i` is n-2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one.
Output: ** `n` is an integer at least 2, `mat` is a 2D list of size n x n where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to n, `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-2, `i` is n-2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: '1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1)**
