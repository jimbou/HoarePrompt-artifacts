To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, which is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n-1`.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables, `mat`, `res`, and `stdin`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `mat` is a 2D list of size n x n where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to n, `res` is the sum of the first n squares of integers from 1 to n, `i` is n-1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one**
