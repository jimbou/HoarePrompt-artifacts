Output State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `mat` is a 2D list of size `n` x `n` where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`, which is equivalent to `(0 + 1) * (2 * 0 + 1) = 1 * 1 = 1`. The values of `n`, `mat`, `i`, and stdin remain unchanged.
