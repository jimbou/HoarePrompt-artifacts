Output: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `mat` is a 2D list of size n x n where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to n, `res` is the sum of the first n squares of integers from 1 to n, `i` is n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and the sum of the squares of the first `n` integers which is `res` and the value of `n` left shifted by 1 (i.e., `n` multiplied by 2) is being printed, and this is printed: '2' followed by the value of `i` which is `n`, followed by the integers from 1 to `n`**
