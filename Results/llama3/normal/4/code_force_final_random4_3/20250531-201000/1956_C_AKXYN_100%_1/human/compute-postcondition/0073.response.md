Based on the initial state, let's break down the print statement:

`print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))`

Here's what will be printed:

* `'1 %d' % i`: This is a formatted string where `%d` is replaced with the value of `i`, which is `n-1`. So, this part will print `'1 ' + str(n-1)`.
* `*range(1, n + 1)`: This will print the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) separated by spaces.

So, the entire print statement will output a string that starts with `'1 ' + str(n-1)` followed by the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Output: **1 (n-1) 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of n)**
