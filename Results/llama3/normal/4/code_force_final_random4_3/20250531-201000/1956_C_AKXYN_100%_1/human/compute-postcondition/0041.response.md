The code prints a formatted string containing the value of `i` which is `n`, and the values of the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). The `*` operator unpacks the range object into separate arguments to the `print` function, so each number in the range is printed as a separate value.

Since `i` is equal to `n`, the first part of the output will be '1' followed by the value of `n`. The second part of the output will be the numbers from 1 to `n`, separated by spaces.

Output: **1 [n], 1, 2, 3, ..., [n] (where [n] is the value of n)**
