This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains a single integer between 1 and 500 inclusive. For each test case, it calculates the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n - 1, prints this sum along with the value of n multiplied by 2, and then prints two sets of numbers from 1 to n for each i from n to 1. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the standard input empty.
