Output State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `mat` is a 2D list of size n x n where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to n, `res` is the sum of the first n squares of integers from 1 to n, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: '2' followed by the value of `i` which is 0, followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `i` has decreased to 0, and the last iteration of the loop has printed '2' followed by the value of `i` (which is 0) and the numbers from 1 to `n`. The other variables, `n`, `mat`, `res`, and `stdin`, remain unchanged.
