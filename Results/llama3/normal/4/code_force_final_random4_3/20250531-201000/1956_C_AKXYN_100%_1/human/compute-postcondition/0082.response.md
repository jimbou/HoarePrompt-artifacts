Output State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `mat` is a 2D list of size n x n where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to n, `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: '1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1), '2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the value of `i` has reached 0. The 2D list `mat` remains unchanged, and the sum `res` is still the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1. The input `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus one. The loop has printed '1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1), '2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1) for each iteration, where `i` is the current value of `i` in the loop.
