Output State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `mat` is a 2D list of size `n` x `n` where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to `n` - 1, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to `n` - 1 which is equal to `res` and the value of `n` left shifted by 1 which is equal to `n` * 2 is printed, '1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1) is printed for each `i` from `n` to 1, and '2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1) is printed for each `i` from `n` to 1.**

This output state means that the loop has executed `n` times, printing the required output for each iteration. The value of `i` has decreased from `n` to 0, and the loop has printed the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n` - 1, which is equal to `res`, and the value of `n` left shifted by 1, which is equal to `n` * 2. The loop has also printed '1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1) and '2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1) for each `i` from `n` to 1.
