To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than 0. Since `n` is already at least 1, we can adjust the state of `i` to be `n`, which is the starting value of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `mat` is a 2D list of size n x n where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to n, `res` is the sum of the first n squares of integers from 1 to n, `i` is n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and the sum of the squares of the first `n` integers which is `res` and the value of `n` left shifted by 1 (i.e., `n` multiplied by 2) is being printed**
