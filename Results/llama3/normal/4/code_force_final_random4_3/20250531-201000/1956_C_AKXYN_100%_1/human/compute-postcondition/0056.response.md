To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is the loop variable `_`, which is not explicitly used in the loop body. However, the loop condition depends on the value of `int(input())`, which is the number of test cases.

At the end of the previous iteration, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. This means that there is at least one more test case to process.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:

* The loop variable `_` is not explicitly used, so we don't need to adjust its value.
* The loop condition depends on the value of `int(input())`, which is the number of test cases. Since there is at least one more test case to process, the loop can execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `mat` is a 2D list of size n x n where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to n, `res` is the sum of the first n squares of integers from 1 to n, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, and this is printed: '2' followed by the value of `i` which is 0, followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`.**

Note that we didn't adjust the values of `n`, `mat`, `res`, or `i`, as they are not directly related to the loop condition. We only adjusted the state of `stdin` to reflect that there is one fewer test case to process.
