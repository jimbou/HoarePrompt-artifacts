To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for i in range(n, 0, -1):`, which means that `i` will decrease by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0.

The current state is:
- `n` is an integer at least 1
- `mat` is a 2D list of size `n` x `n` where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to `n`
- `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to `n` - 1
- `i` is `n`
- `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one
- The sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to `n` - 1 is printed, which is equal to `res`
- The value of `n` left shifted by 1 is printed, which is equal to `n` * 2
- '1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1) is printed
- '2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1) is printed

Since `i` is `n` and the loop will execute again only if `i` is greater than 0, we need to decrease `i` by 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `mat` is a 2D list of size `n` x `n` where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to `n` - 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to `n` - 1 which is equal to `res` and the value of `n` left shifted by 1 which is equal to `n` * 2, and this is printed: '1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1), and this is printed: '2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1)**
