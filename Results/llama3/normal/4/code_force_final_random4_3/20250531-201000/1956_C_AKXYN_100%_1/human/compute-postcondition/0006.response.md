The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer at least 3, `mat` is a 2D list of size `n` x `n` where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is `2 * (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
