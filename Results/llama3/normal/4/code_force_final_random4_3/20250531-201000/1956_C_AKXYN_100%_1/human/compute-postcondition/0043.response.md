The code prints a string that starts with '2', followed by the value of `i` which is `n`, and then the integers from 1 to `n`. Since `n` is an integer at least 1, the value of `i` is also at least 1. The `*range(1, n + 1)` expression generates a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`, which are then printed after the string '2' and the value of `i`.

Output: **2 [n] 1 2 3 ... [n] (where n is the value of n)**
