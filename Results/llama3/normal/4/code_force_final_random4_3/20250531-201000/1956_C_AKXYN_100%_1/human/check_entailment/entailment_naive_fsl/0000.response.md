Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct because it follows the problem description for every potential case. The program generates a matrix filled with numbers from 1 to n, and then it calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix. The program also prints the maximum sum and the number of operations required to achieve this sum.

The program uses a clever approach to maximize the sum of the numbers in the matrix. It first initializes the matrix with numbers from 1 to n, and then it calculates the sum of the numbers in the matrix. The sum is calculated as the sum of the products of each number and its position in the matrix.

The program then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations required to achieve this sum. The number of operations is calculated as 2n, where n is the size of the matrix.

The program also prints the operations required to achieve the maximum sum. The operations are printed in the format "1 i p1 p2 ... pn" or "2 i p1 p2 ... pn", where i is the row or column index, and p1, p2, ..., pn are the permutation of numbers from 1 to n.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and prints the operations required to achieve this sum. The program also follows the problem description and does not exceed the limit of 2n operations.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
