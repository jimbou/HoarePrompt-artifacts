Output State: **`n` is an integer at least 2, `mat` is a 2D list of size n x n where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to n, `res` is 1 + (1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1) = 7, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: '2' followed by the value of `i` which is 1, followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` has been updated to 7, which is the result of adding `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to the initial value of `res`, which was 1. The values of `n`, `mat`, `i`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The same output is still printed: '2' followed by the value of `i` which is 1, followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`.
