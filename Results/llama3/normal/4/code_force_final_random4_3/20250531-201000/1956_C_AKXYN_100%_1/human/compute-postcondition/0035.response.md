Output State: **`n` is an integer at least 2, `mat` is a 2D list of size n x n where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to n, `res` is 7 + (2 + 1) * (2 * 2 + 1), `i` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to 7 + (2 + 1) * (2 * 2 + 1), which is equal to 7 + 3 * 5 = 7 + 15 = 22. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
