The code prints a string that starts with '2' followed by the value of `i` which is equal to `n`, and then the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) separated by spaces.
Output: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `mat` is a 2D list of size `n` x `n` where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to `n` - 1, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to `n` - 1 which is equal to `res` and the value of `n` left shifted by 1 which is equal to `n` * 2, and this is printed: '1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1), and this is printed: '2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1)**
