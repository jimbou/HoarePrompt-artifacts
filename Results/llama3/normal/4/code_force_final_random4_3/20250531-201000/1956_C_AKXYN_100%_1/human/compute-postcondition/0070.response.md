The `print` statement is printing a string that starts with '2 ', followed by the value of `i`, which is `n`, and then the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Here's a breakdown of the output:

- `'2 %d' % i`: This is a formatted string where `%d` is a placeholder for an integer. The `%` operator is used to insert the value of `i` (which is `n`) into the string. So, this part of the output will be '2 ' followed by the value of `n`.

- `*range(1, n + 1)`: This is using the `*` operator to unpack the range of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) into separate arguments to the `print` function. So, this part of the output will be the numbers from 1 to `n`, separated by spaces.

So, the overall output will be a string that starts with '2 ', followed by the value of `n`, followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`, all separated by spaces.

Output: **2 [n] [1, 2, 3, ..., n] (where n is the value of n)**
