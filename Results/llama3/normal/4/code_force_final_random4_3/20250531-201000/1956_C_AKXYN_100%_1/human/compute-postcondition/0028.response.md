The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1 the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `int(input())` is at least 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `int(input())` must be at least 2.
State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `mat` is a 2D list of size `n` x `n` where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to `n` - 1, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to `n` - 1 which is equal to `res` and the value of `n` left shifted by 1 which is equal to `n` * 2 is printed, '1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1) is printed for each `i` from `n` to 1, and '2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1) is printed for each `i` from `n` to 1.**
