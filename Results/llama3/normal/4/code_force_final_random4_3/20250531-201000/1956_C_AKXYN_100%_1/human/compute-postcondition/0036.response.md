Output State: `n` is an integer at least 1, `mat` is a 2D list of size n x n where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to n, `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n - 1, `i` is n - 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one.

This output state represents the final state after the loop has executed all its iterations. The value of `res` is the sum of the products of `(i + 1)` and `(2 * i + 1)` for all values of `i` from 0 to `n - 1`. The value of `i` is `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The state of `mat` and `stdin` remains unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
