Output State: **n is an integer at least 1, mat is a 2D list of size n x n where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to n, res is 0, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

Explanation:

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` is an integer at least 1, the new value of `n` is also an integer at least 1. The second line creates a 2D list `mat` of size `n` x `n` where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to `n`. The third line resets `res` to 0.

The initial state of `i` is 0, and it is not modified by the code. The initial state of `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, and one test case is consumed by the first line, leaving multiple test cases minus one.

Note that the code does not modify the values of `i` and `stdin` that are not related to the input and output operations. The values of `i` and `stdin` remain the same as in the initial state.
