Output State: **`n` is an integer at least 3, `mat` is a 2D list of size `n` x `n` where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is `2 * (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) + (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated by adding `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to its initial value. Since `i` is 2, the new value of `res` is `2 * (2 + 1) * (2 * 2 + 1) + (2 + 1) * (2 * 2 + 1)`, which simplifies to `2 * 3 * 5 + 3 * 5`. The values of `n`, `mat`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
