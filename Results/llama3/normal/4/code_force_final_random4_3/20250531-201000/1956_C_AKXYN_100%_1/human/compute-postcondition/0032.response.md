To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `n` must still be at least 1.

State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `mat` is a 2D list of size n x n where each row contains consecutive integers from 1 to n, `res` is 1, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one**
