According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. So for the loop to be executed `t` must be greater than 0 and the stdin must have at least 1 test case.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases**
