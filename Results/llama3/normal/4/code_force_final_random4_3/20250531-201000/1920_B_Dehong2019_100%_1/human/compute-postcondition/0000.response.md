Output State: **t is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, k, and x. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.**

The code reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This means that the number of test cases in the standard input is reduced by one. The remaining test cases are still present in the standard input, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains three integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`.
