Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in the list plus the first integer in list `a` plus the third integer in list `a`, if `i + x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is further updated by subtracting twice the `(i+x)`th integer in list `a` plus the fourth integer in list `a` minus twice the `(i+x)`th integer in list `a`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is equal to the initial value of `x`, and `i` is 3.**
