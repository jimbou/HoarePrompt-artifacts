Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of integers sorted in descending order, ans1 is the sum of the integers in list a minus twice the sum of the integers in list a from index k to x-1, ans2 is the maximum of ans1 and the previous value of ans2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, x is an integer, and i is x-1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `ans1` will be the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index `k` to `x-1`, and `ans2` will be the maximum of `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
