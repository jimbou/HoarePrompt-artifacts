Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is the integer value of the second input, `x` is an integer value greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index 0 to `x-1`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index 0 to `x-1`, `i` is `k+x-1`, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `ans2` has been updated to be equal to `ans1`, which is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index 0 to `x-1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
