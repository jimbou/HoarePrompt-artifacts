Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in the list plus the first integer in list `a` plus the third integer in list `a`, if `i + x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is further updated by subtracting twice the `(i+x)`th integer in list `a` plus the fourth integer in list `a` minus twice the `(i+x)`th integer in list `a`, `ans2` is the maximum of the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in the list plus the first integer in list `a` plus the third integer in list `a`, if `i + x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is further updated by subtracting twice the `(i+x)`th integer in list `a` plus the fourth integer in list `a` minus twice the `(i+x)`th integer in list `a` and the previous value of `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is equal to the initial value of `x`, and `i` is 3.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `ans2` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `ans1`, which is a complex expression involving the sum of the integers in list `a`, the sum of the `x` largest integers in the list, and the first, third, and fourth integers in the list, with additional updates if `i + x` is less than `n`.
