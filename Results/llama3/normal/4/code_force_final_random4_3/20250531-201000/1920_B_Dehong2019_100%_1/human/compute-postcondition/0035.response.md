Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the value of `a[k]` minus twice the value of `a[k+1]`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` must be greater than `k+1`, `i` is `k+1`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been updated by subtracting twice the value of `a[k+1]` from its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
