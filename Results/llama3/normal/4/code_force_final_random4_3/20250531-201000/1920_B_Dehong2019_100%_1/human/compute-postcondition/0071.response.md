Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer value greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index 0 to `x-1` plus `a[0]`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index 0 to `x-1`, `i` is 0, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The current value of `i` plus `x` is less than `n`.**
