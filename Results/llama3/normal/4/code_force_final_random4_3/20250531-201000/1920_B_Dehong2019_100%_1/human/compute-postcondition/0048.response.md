Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than `x-1`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index `k` to `x` plus `a[x-1]` minus twice `a[x+i]`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index `k` to `x-1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is an integer greater than `k`, and `i` is `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans1` has been updated by subtracting twice the value of `a[x+i]` from its previous value. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
