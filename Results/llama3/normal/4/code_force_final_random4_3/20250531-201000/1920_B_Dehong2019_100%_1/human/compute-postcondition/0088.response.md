Output State: **t is an integer equal to 0, n is an integer, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of integers sorted in descending order, ans1 is the sum of the integers in list a minus twice the sum of the integers in list a from index 0 to x-1 plus the sum of the integers in list a from index 0 to k-1 minus twice the sum of the integers in list a from index x to k+x-1, ans2 is the maximum of ans1 and its previous value, i is equal to k, stdin contains no inputs, and x is an integer, and ans2 is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: the loop has finished executing all the test cases, and the final maximum value of ans1 and its previous value, which is ans2, is printed. The loop variables t, n, k, a, ans1, ans2, i, and x have the values as described above. The stdin contains no more inputs, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
