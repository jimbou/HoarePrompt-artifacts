Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is the integer value of the first input, k is the integer value of the second input, x is an integer value greater than 0, a is a list of integers sorted in descending order, ans1 is the sum of the integers in list a minus twice the sum of the integers in list a from index 0 to x-1, ans2 is the maximum of ans1 and the sum of the integers in list a minus twice the sum of the integers in list a from index k to x-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is k+x-1, _ is 1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `ans1` will be the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index 0 to `x-1`. The variable `ans2` will be the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index `k` to `x-1`. The variable `i` will be `k+x-1`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
