The value of `ans1` is increased by the value of `a[i]`. The value of `a[i]` is an integer because `a` is a list of integers. The value of `i` is increased by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer value greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `i` is increased by 1, `ans1` is increased by the value of `a[i]`**
