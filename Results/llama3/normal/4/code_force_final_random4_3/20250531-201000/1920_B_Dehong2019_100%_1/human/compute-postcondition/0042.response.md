Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index `k` to `x-1` plus `a[x-1]`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index `k` to `x-1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is an integer greater than `k`, and `i` is `x-1`. The current value of `i` plus `x` is less than `n`.***
