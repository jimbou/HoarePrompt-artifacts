The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1 if `i + x` is less than `n`, and `k` is greater than 0. So for the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again k must be greater than i.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is greater than i, `x` is an integer value greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans2` is the maximum of its previous value and `ans1`, `i` is increased by 1, and `ans1` is increased by the value of `a[i]` minus twice the value of `a[i + x]` if `i + x` is less than `n`.**
