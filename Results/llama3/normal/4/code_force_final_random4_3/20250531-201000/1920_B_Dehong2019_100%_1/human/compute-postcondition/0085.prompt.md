Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is the integer value of the second input, `x` is an integer value greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index 0 to `x-1`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index 0 to `x-1`, `i` is `k+x-1`, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    ans1 += a[i]
    if i + x < n:
        ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
    ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer value greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order. If `i` plus `x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index 0 to `x-1` plus `a[0]` minus twice `a[i+x]`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index 0 to `x-1`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans1` and `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer value greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans2` is the maximum of its previous value and `ans1`, `i` is increased by 1 if `i + x` is less than `n`, and `ans1` is increased by the value of `a[i]` minus twice the value of `a[i + x]` if `i + x` is less than `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is greater than `i`, `x` is an integer value greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and its previous value, `i` is increased by 1. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is increased by the value of `a[i]` minus twice the value of `a[i + x]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
