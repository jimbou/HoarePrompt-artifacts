Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer value greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `i` is increased by 1, `ans1` is increased by the value of `a[i]` minus twice the value of `a[i + x]`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been updated by subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x]` from its previous value, which was increased by the value of `a[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
