Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than `x`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `x` is an integer greater than `k-1`, `i` is `x+1`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index `k` to `x` plus `a[x-1]` minus twice `a[x+i]` minus twice `a[i+x]` plus `a[x+1]`, and `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index `k` to `x-1`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `ans1` has been updated to subtract twice the value of `a[i+x]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
