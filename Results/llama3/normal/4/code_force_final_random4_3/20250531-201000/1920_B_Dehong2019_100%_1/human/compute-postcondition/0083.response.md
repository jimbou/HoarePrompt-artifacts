Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is greater than `i`, `x` is an integer value greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans2` is the maximum of its previous value and `ans1`, `i` is increased by 1. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is increased by the value of `a[i]` minus twice the value of `a[i + x]`.***
