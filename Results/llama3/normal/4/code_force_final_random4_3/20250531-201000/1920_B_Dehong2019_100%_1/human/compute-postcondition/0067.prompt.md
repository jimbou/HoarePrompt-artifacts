Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0, n is the integer value of the first input, k is the integer value of the second input, x is the integer value of the third input, a is a list of integers sorted in descending order, ans1 is the sum of the integers in list a, ans2 is the maximum of ans1 and the sum of the integers in list a minus twice the sum of the integers in list a from index k to x-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is k+x-1, ans2 is printed, _ is 1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    ans1 -= a[i] * 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is the integer value of the second input, `x` is an integer value greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the integer at index `k+x-1`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index `k` to `x-1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is `k+x-1`, `_` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is the integer value of the second input, `x` is an integer value greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the integer at index `k+x` minus twice the integer at index `k+x`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index `k` to `x`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is `k+x`, `_` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is the integer value of the second input, `x` is an integer value greater than `k+x+1`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the integer at index `k+x` minus twice the integer at index `k+x` minus twice the integer at index `k+x+1`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index `k` to `x`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is `k+x+1`, `_` is 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
