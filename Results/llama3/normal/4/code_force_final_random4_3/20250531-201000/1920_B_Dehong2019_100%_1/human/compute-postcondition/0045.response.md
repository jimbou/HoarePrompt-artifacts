Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index `k` to `x-1` plus `a[x-1]`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index `k` to `x-1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is an integer greater than `k`, and `i` is `x-1`. If `i` plus `x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is updated by subtracting twice the integer at index `2x - 1` in the list `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `ans2` is now the maximum of its original value and `ans1`. This means that `ans2` will be the maximum of the two possible values it could have taken, depending on whether `ans1` was greater or not. All other variables remain unchanged.
