Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in the list, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in the list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is equal to the initial value of `x`, `i` is equal to `x-1`.**

In this output state, a new variable `ans2` has been introduced and assigned the same value as `ans1`, which is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in the list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
