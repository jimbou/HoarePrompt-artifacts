The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k+x`, `x` is an integer value greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is `k+x+1` and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than `k+x+1`.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is the integer value of the second input, `x` is an integer value greater than `k+x+1`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the integer at index `k+x` minus twice the integer at index `k+x`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index `k` to `x`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is `k+x+1`, `_` is 1**
