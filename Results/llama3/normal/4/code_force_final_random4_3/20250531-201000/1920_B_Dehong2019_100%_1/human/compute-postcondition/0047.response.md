The value of `ans1` is increased by `a[i]`. Since `i` is `x`, `a[i]` is `a[x]`. The value of `ans1` is now the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index `k` to `x-1` plus `a[x-1]` plus `a[x]`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than `x-1`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index `k` to `x` plus `a[x-1]`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index `k` to `x-1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is an integer greater than `k`, and `i` is `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than `x-1`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index `k` to `x` plus `a[x-1]`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index `k` to `x-1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is an integer greater than `k`, and `i` is `x`.**
