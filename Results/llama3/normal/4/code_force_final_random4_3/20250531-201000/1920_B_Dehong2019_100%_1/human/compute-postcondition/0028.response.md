The code prints the maximum value of `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2` after all iterations of the loop are completed. Where `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in the list plus the sum of the first `k` integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers at indices `x` to `x+k-1` in list `a`, and `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2`.
Output: **the maximum value of ans1 and the previous value of ans2**
