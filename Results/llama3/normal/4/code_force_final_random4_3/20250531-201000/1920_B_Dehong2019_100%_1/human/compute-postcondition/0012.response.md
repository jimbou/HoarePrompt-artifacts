Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in the list plus the first integer in list `a`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in the list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is equal to the initial value of `x`, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been updated by adding the first integer in the list `a` to its initial value. The value of `i` has also been updated to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
