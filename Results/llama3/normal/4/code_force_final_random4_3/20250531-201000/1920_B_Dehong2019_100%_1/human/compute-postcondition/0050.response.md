Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than `x-1`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `x` is an integer greater than `k`, `i` is `x`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index `k` to `x` plus `a[x-1]` minus twice `a[x+i]`, and `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index `k` to `x-1`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans2` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `ans1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
