Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, k, and x. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)
    ans1 = sum(a)
    for i in range(x):
        ans1 -= a[i] * 2
    ans2 = ans1
    for i in range(k):
        ans1 += a[i]
        if i + x < n:
            ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
        ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)
    print(ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The final output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in the list plus the sum of the first `k` integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers at indices `x` to `x+k-1` in list `a`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is equal to the initial value of `x`, and `i` is `k`, and the maximum value of `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2` which is `ans2` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of integers sorted in descending order, ans1 is the sum of the integers in list a minus twice the sum of the integers in list a from index k to k+x-1 plus the sum of the integers in list a from index k to k+x-1, ans2 is the maximum of ans1 and the sum of the integers in list a minus twice the sum of the integers in list a from index k to x-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, x is an integer, and i is k+x-1, and ans2 is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `x` is an integer value greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and its previous value, `i` is equal to `k`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index 0 to `x-1` plus the sum of the integers in list `a` from index 0 to `k-1` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index `x` to `k+x-1`, and ans2 is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
