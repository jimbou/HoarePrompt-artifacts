Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the value of `a[k]`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans1` has been updated to be the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the value of `a[k]`, while the other variables remain unchanged.
