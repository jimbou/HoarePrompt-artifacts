Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer value greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index 0 to `x-1` plus `a[0]` minus twice `a[i+x]`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index 0 to `x-1`, `i` is 0, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The current value of `i` plus `x` is less than `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been updated by subtracting twice the value of `a[i+x]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans1` is now equal to the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index 0 to `x-1` plus `a[0]` minus twice `a[i+x]`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
