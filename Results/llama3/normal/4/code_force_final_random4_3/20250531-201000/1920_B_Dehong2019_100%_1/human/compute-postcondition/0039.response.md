Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of integers sorted in descending order, ans1 is the sum of the integers in list a minus twice the sum of the integers in list a from index k to x-1, ans2 is the sum of the integers in list a minus twice the sum of the integers in list a from index k to x-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, x is an integer, and i is x-1.**

In this output state, the value of ans2 has been updated to be equal to ans1, which is the sum of the integers in list a minus twice the sum of the integers in list a from index k to x-1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
