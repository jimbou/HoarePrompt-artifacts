Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is the integer value of the second input, `x` is an integer value greater than `k+x+1`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the integer at index `k+x` minus twice the integer at index `k+x` minus twice the integer at index `k+x+1`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index `k` to `x`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is `k+x+1`, `_` is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans1` has been updated by subtracting twice the integer at index `k+x+1` from its previous value. The values of the other variables remain the same.
