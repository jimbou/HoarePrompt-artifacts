Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is greater than `i`, `x` is an integer value greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans2` is the maximum of its previous value and `ans1`, `i` is increased by 1, and `ans1` is increased by the value of `a[i]`**.

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been updated by adding the value of `a[i]` to it. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The list `a` is still sorted in descending order, and `i` has been increased by 1. The relationship between `k` and `i` is still maintained, with `k` being greater than `i`. The value of `n` is still the integer value of the first input, and `t` is still an integer greater than 0. The value of `x` is still an integer greater than 0. The value of `ans2` is still the maximum of its previous value and `ans1`.
