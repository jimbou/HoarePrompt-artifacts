Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, k, and x, and the second line contains n integers. The function then calculates the maximum possible sum of the integers in each test case by applying certain operations, and prints the maximum sum for each test case. The operations involve sorting the integers in descending order, subtracting twice the sum of the first x integers, adding the sum of the first k integers, and subtracting twice the sum of the integers from index x to k+x-1. The function repeats this process for each test case and prints the maximum sum obtained for each case.**
