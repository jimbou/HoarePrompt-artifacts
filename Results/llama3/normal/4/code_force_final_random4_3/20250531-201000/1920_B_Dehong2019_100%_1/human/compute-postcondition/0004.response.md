The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` subtracts twice the value of the first element in list `a` from `ans1`. Since `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, the first element is the largest integer in the list. The value of `i` is 0, so `a[i]` is the first element of the list.

The value of `ans1` is updated to be the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the largest integer in the list.

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the largest integer in the list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
