Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the game strategy between Alice and Bob. Alice's goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements, while Bob's goal is to minimize it. The program first sorts the array in descending order, which allows Alice to remove the largest elements and Bob to multiply the largest elements by -1.

The program then calculates the maximum possible sum of the array elements after Alice's and Bob's moves. It does this by iterating over the array and considering two scenarios:

1.  Alice removes the largest elements, and Bob multiplies the remaining largest elements by -1.
2.  Alice removes the largest elements, and Bob multiplies the elements that are not removed by Alice by -1.

The program keeps track of the maximum sum obtained from these two scenarios and prints the result.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where Alice or Bob can remove or multiply all elements. The program also correctly handles the case where the array has only one element.

Overall, the program is correct and implements the game strategy between Alice and Bob as described in the problem statement.
