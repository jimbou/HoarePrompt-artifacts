Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in the list plus the first integer in list `a`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is equal to the initial value of `x`, and `i` is 1. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is updated to be the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in the list plus the first integer in list `a` minus twice the value of the integer at index `i + x` in list `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans2` has been updated to be the maximum of `ans1` and its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans1` is still dependent on the condition `i + x` being less than `n`, and its value is updated accordingly.
