Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer value greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans2` is the maximum of its previous value and `ans1`, `i` is increased by 1 if `i + x` is less than `n`, and `ans1` is increased by the value of `a[i]` minus twice the value of `a[i + x]` if `i + x` is less than `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans2` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `ans1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1 if `i + x` is less than `n`, and the value of `ans1` has been updated accordingly.
