Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than `x-1`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `x` is an integer greater than `k`, and `i` is `x`. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index `k` to `x` plus `a[x-1]` minus twice `a[x+i]`, and `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index `k` to `x-1`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
