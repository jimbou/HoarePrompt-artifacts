Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the largest integer in the list minus twice the second largest integer in the list minus twice the third largest integer in the list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been updated by subtracting twice the third largest integer in the list `a` from its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
