Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in the list, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in the list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is equal to the initial value of `x`, `i` is equal to `x-1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    ans1 += a[i]
    if i + x < n:
        ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
    ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in the list plus the first integer in list `a`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is equal to the initial value of `x`, and `i` is 1. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is updated to be the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in the list plus the first integer in list `a` minus twice the value of the integer at index `i + x` in list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in the list plus the first integer in list `a` plus the third integer in list `a`, if `i + x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is further updated by subtracting twice the `(i+x)`th integer in list `a`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is equal to the initial value of `x`, and `i` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in the list plus the first integer in list `a` plus the third integer in list `a`, if `i + x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is further updated by subtracting twice the `(i+x)`th integer in list `a` plus the fourth integer in list `a` minus twice the `(i+x)`th integer in list `a`, `ans2` is the maximum of the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in the list plus the first integer in list `a` plus the third integer in list `a`, if `i + x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is further updated by subtracting twice the `(i+x)`th integer in list `a` plus the fourth integer in list `a` minus twice the `(i+x)`th integer in list `a` and the previous value of `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is equal to the initial value of `x`, and `i` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
