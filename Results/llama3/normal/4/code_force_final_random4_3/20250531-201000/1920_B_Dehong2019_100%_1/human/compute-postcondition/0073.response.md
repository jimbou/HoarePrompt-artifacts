Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer value greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order. If `i` plus `x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index 0 to `x-1` plus `a[0]` minus twice `a[i+x]`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in list `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in list `a` from index 0 to `x-1`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans1` and `ans2`.***
