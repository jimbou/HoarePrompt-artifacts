Postcondition: ***s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing either a single element 0 or two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of n - 1 elements where the last element is calculated based on the number of '>' characters and the index i is n - 3, el is either '<' or '>' character from s1 at index i. If el is '>', then preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1 with the last element removed, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1 minus 1, and ans is updated based on the number of '>' characters and the index i is n - 3. If ol is less than or equal to zr, then ans[i] is calculated as zeroInd - oneInd, where zeroInd is 2 times the result of func_1(suffZero, ol) and oneInd is 2 times the last element of preOne minus the result of func_1(preOne, 1). Otherwise, the last element of ans is updated based on the number of '>' characters and the index i is n - 3. If el is '<', then suffZero is a list containing two elements: 0 and n, and ans is updated based on the number of '>' characters and the index i is n - 3. If zr is less than or equal to ol, then ans[i] is n + 1 + zeroInd - oneInd where zeroInd is n and oneInd is 2 * func_1(preOne, zr). Otherwise, ans[i] is an integer calculated based on zeroInd and oneInd where zeroInd is an integer calculated based on the suffZero list and ol + 1, and oneInd is an integer calculated based on the preOne list.***
