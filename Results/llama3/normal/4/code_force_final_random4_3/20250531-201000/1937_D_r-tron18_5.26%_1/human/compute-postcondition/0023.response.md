Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing either a single element 0 or two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of n - 1 elements where the last element is updated based on the number of '>' characters and the index i is n - 2, el is either '<' or '>' character from s1 at index i, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is the last element of suffZero which is either 0 or n.**

The code updates the last element of the `ans` list based on the number of '>' characters and the index `i` is `n - 2`. The values of `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi` are calculated using the `func_1` function and the values of `suffZero`, `preOne`, and `zr`. The `ans[i]` is then updated using these calculated values. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
