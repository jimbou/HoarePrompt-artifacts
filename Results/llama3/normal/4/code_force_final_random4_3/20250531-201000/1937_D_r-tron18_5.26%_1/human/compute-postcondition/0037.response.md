Output State: **`preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1` with the last element removed, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1, `n` is a positive integer, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s1` (1-indexed), `suffZero` is a list containing either a single element 0 or two elements: 0 and `n`, `ans` is a list of `n - 1` elements where the last element is calculated based on the number of '>' characters and the index `i` is `n - 3`, `el` is either '<' or '>' character from `s1` at index `i`.**

The code snippet modifies the `preOne` list by removing its last element and decrements the `totalOne` variable by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The `preOne` list now contains cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1` without the last element, and `totalOne` is reduced by 1, reflecting the updated count of '>' characters in `s1`. The rest of the variables maintain their initial values, including `n`, `s1`, `pre`, `suffZero`, `ans`, and `el`.
