Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s1` (1-indexed), `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is either '<' or '>' depending on the character at index `n - 1` in `s1`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `el` which is assigned the value of the character at index `n - 1` in the string `s1`. This character can be either '<' or '>' depending on the value of `s1`.
