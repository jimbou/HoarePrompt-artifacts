Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of n - 1 elements where the last element is calculated based on the number of '>' characters and the index i is n - 2, el is either '<' or '>' character from s1 at index i, zeroInd is n, oneInd is 2 * func_1(preOne, zr), ans[i] is n + 1 + zeroInd - oneInd.**

The code executes the following operations:

1.  `zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`: This line calculates the value of `zeroInd` by adding the last two elements of the `suffZero` list. Since `suffZero` contains the elements 0 and n, `zeroInd` becomes n.
2.  `oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`: This line calculates the value of `oneInd` by calling the function `func_1` with the arguments `preOne` and `zr`, and then multiplying the result by 2. The value of `oneInd` depends on the implementation of the function `func_1`.
3.  `ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`: This line calculates the value of `ans[i]` by subtracting `oneInd` from `zeroInd`, adding n, and then adding 1. The value of `ans[i]` depends on the values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd`.

The final state includes the initial state variables s1, n, pre, totalOne, preOne, suffZero, ans, and el, as well as the new variables zeroInd, oneInd, and the updated value of ans[i].
