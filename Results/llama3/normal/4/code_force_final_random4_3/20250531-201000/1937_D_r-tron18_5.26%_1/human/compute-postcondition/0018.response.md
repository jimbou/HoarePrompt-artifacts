Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s1` (1-indexed), `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing either a single element 0 or two elements: 0 and `n`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is calculated based on the number of '>' characters and the index `i` is `n - 1`. If `el` is '>', then `totalOne` is decreased by 1, `preOne` has its last element removed, and the last element of `ans` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd` if the number of '>' characters is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. If `el` is '<', then `suffZero` contains two elements: 0 and `n`, and the last element of `ans` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, otherwise it is `zeroInd - oneInd`.***
