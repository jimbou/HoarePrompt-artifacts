Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of n - 1 elements where the last element is calculated based on the number of '>' characters and the index i is n - 2, el is either '<' or '>' character from s1 at index i.**

The code block modifies the state of the variables as follows:

*   The first line appends the value of `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` to the `suffZero` list. Since `suffZero` initially contains either a single element 0 or two elements: 0 and `n`, and `i` is `n - 2`, the new value appended to `suffZero` will be `n`. Therefore, `suffZero` will now contain two elements: 0 and `n`.
*   The second line assigns the value of `totalOne` to `ol` and the value of `len(suffZero) - 1` to `zr`. Since `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` and `suffZero` now contains two elements, `ol` will be the number of '>' characters in `s1` and `zr` will be 1.

The other variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `preOne`, `ans`, and `el`) are not modified by the code block.
