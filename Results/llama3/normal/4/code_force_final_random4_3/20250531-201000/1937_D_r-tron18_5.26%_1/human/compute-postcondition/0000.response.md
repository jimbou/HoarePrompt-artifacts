Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, ans is a list of n zeros**.

In this output state, the initial state of `s1` and `n` remains unchanged. The code creates new variables `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, and `ans`. The `pre` list contains the indices (1-indexed) of all '>' characters in `s1`. The `totalOne` variable is set to the number of '>' characters in `s1`, which is the length of the `pre` list. The `preOne` list contains the cumulative sums of the indices of '>' characters in `s1`, starting from 0. The `suffZero` list contains a single element, 0. The `ans` list is initialized with `n` zeros.
