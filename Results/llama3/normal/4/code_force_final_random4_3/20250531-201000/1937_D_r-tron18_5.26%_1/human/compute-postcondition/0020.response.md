Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s1` (1-indexed), `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing either a single element 0 or two elements: 0 and `n`, `ans` is a list of `n - 1` elements where the last element is calculated based on the number of '>' characters and the index `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is either '<' or '>' character from `s1` at index `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `el` is determined by the character at index `i` in the string `s1`. The other variables remain unchanged, as the code only assigns the value of `s1[i]` to `el` without modifying any other variables.
