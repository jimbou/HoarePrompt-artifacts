Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of n - 1 elements where the last element is calculated based on the number of '>' characters and the index i is n - 2, el is either '<' or '>' character from s1 at index i, zeroInd is an integer calculated based on the suffZero list and ol + 1, oneInd is an integer calculated based on the preOne list, ans[i] is an integer calculated based on zeroInd and oneInd.**

The code calculates the value of `zeroInd` based on the `suffZero` list and `ol + 1`, and assigns it to `zeroInd`. It then calculates the value of `oneInd` based on the `preOne` list and assigns it to `oneInd`. Finally, it calculates the value of `ans[i]` based on `zeroInd` and `oneInd` and assigns it to `ans[i]`. The values of `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, and `el` remain unchanged.
