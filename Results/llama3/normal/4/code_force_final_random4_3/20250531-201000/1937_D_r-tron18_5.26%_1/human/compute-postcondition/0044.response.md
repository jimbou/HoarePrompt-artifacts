The code prints the elements of the list `ans`, which contains `n` elements. Each element in `ans` is calculated based on the number of '>' characters and the index `i`.

Since the exact string `s1` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated values of `ans`.

Output: **[calculated values of ans] (where each element is calculated based on the number of '>' characters and the index i)**
