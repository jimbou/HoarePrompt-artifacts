Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, ans is a list of n zeros
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    el = s1[i]
    if el == '>':
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if ol <= zr:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
            oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
            oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
            fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
        preOne.pop()
        totalOne -= 1
    else:
        suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if zr <= ol:
            zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
            oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s1` (1-indexed), `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing either a single element 0 or two elements: 0 and `n`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is calculated based on the number of '>' characters and the index `i` is `n - 1`. If `el` is '>', then `totalOne` is decreased by 1, `preOne` has its last element removed, and the last element of `ans` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd` if the number of '>' characters is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. If `el` is '<', then `suffZero` contains two elements: 0 and `n`, and the last element of `ans` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, otherwise it is `zeroInd - oneInd`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s1` (1-indexed), `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing either a single element 0 or two elements: 0 and `n`, `ans` is a list of `n - 1` elements where the last element is calculated based on the number of '>' characters and the index `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is either '<' or '>' character from `s1` at index `i`. If `el` is '>', then `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1` with the last element removed, and `ans` is updated based on the number of '>' characters and the index `i` is `n - 2`. If `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, then `ans[i]` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd`, where `zeroInd` is 2 times the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)` and `oneInd` is 2 times the last element of `preOne` minus the result of `func_1(preOne, 1)`. Otherwise, the last element of `ans` is updated based on the number of '>' characters and the index `i` is `n - 2`. If `el` is '<', then `suffZero` is a list containing two elements: 0 and `n`, and `ans` is updated based on the number of '>' characters and the index `i` is `n - 2`. If `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, then `ans[i]` is `n + 1 + zeroInd - oneInd` where `zeroInd` is `n` and `oneInd` is 2 * `func_1(preOne, zr)`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is an integer calculated based on `zeroInd` and `oneInd` where `zeroInd` is an integer calculated based on the `suffZero` list and `ol + 1`, and `oneInd` is an integer calculated based on the `preOne` list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing either a single element 0 or two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of n - 1 elements where the last element is calculated based on the number of '>' characters and the index i is n - 3, el is either '<' or '>' character from s1 at index i. If el is '>', then preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1 with the last element removed, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1 minus 1, and ans is updated based on the number of '>' characters and the index i is n - 3. If ol is less than or equal to zr, then ans[i] is calculated as zeroInd - oneInd, where zeroInd is 2 times the result of func_1(suffZero, ol) and oneInd is 2 times the last element of preOne minus the result of func_1(preOne, 1). Otherwise, the last element of ans is updated based on the number of '>' characters and the index i is n - 3. If el is '<', then suffZero is a list containing two elements: 0 and n, and ans is updated based on the number of '>' characters and the index i is n - 3. If zr is less than or equal to ol, then ans[i] is n + 1 + zeroInd - oneInd where zeroInd is n and oneInd is 2 * func_1(preOne, zr). Otherwise, ans[i] is an integer calculated based on zeroInd and oneInd where zeroInd is an integer calculated based on the suffZero list and ol + 1, and oneInd is an integer calculated based on the preOne list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
