Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is zeroInd - oneInd, i is n - 1, el is '>', ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, and zr is 0.**

The code snippet calculates the values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd` using the functions `func_1` and the given lists `suffZero` and `preOne`. The value of `zeroInd` is calculated as twice the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`, and the value of `oneInd` is calculated as twice the last element of `preOne` minus the result of `func_1(preOne, 1)`. The difference between `zeroInd` and `oneInd` is then assigned to the last element of the list `ans`. The values of `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `i`, `el`, `ol`, and `zr` remain unchanged.
