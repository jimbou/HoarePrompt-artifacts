Postcondition: ***s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements: 0 and n + i + 1, ans is a list of n - 1 elements where the last element is calculated based on the number of '>' characters and the index i is n - 3, el is either '<' or '>' character from s1 at index i. If zr <= ol, then ans[i] is calculated as zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1, where zeroInd is suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2] and oneInd is 2 * func_1(preOne, zr). Otherwise, zeroInd is an integer calculated based on the suffZero list and ol + 1, and oneInd is an integer calculated based on the preOne list.***
