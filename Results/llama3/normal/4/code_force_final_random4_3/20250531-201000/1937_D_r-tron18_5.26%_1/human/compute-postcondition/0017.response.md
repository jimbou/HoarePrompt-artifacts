Postcondition: ***s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements: 0 and n, i is n - 1, el is '<', ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 1. If zr is less than or equal to ol, then ans is a list of n integers with the last element being zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1. Otherwise, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is zeroInd - oneInd.***
