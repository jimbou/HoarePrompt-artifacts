Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of n zeros, i is n - 1, el is '<', ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 1**

In this output state, the value of `suffZero` has been updated to contain two elements: 0 and `n`, where `n` is the length of the string `s1`. The value of `ol` has been set to the number of '>' characters in `s1`, which is the same as the value of `totalOne`. The value of `zr` has been set to 1, which is the index of the second element in the `suffZero` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
