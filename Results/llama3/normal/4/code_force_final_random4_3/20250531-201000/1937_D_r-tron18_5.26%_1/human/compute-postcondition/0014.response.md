Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of n integers with the last element being zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1, i is n - 1, el is '<', ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans[i]` has been updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, where `zeroInd` is the sum of the last two elements of `suffZero` (which is `n + 0`) and `oneInd` is twice the value returned by `func_1(preOne, zr)`. The values of `suffZero`, `preOne`, `zr`, `ol`, `el`, `i`, `n`, `totalOne`, and `pre` remain unchanged.
