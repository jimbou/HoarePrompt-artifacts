This function takes a string s1 of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>' as input and returns a list of calculated values. The function calculates the values based on the number of '>' characters and their indices in the string. It iterates through the string from right to left, maintaining a list of indices of '>' characters and a list of cumulative sums of these indices. For each character, it calculates a value based on the number of '>' characters and their indices, and stores this value in a result list. The function returns the result list, which contains the calculated values for each character in the input string.
