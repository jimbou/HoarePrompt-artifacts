#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, times is a non-negative integer.

    #The program returns the difference between the last element of the list `arr` and the element at the index calculated by `max(-n, -1 - times)`, where `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and `times` is a non-negative integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates and returns the difference between the last element of the input list `arr` and the element at a specific index, which is determined by the maximum of two values: the negative length of `arr` and the negative of one minus the input `times`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a string s1 of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>' as input and returns a list of calculated values. The function calculates the values based on the number of '>' characters and their indices in the string. It iterates through the string from right to left, maintaining a list of indices of '>' characters and a list of cumulative sums of these indices. For each character, it calculates a value based on the number of '>' characters and their indices, and stores this value in a result list. The function returns the result list, which contains the calculated values for each character in the input string.
