Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing either a single element 0 or two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of n - 1 elements where the last element is calculated based on the number of '>' characters and the index i is n - 2, el is either '<' or '>' character from s1 at index i, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is the last element of suffZero which is either 0 or n, zeroInd is 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol), oneInd is 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1), ans[i] is zeroInd - oneInd**
