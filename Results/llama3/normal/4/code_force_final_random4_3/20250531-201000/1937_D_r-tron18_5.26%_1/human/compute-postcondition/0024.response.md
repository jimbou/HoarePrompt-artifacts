Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s1` (1-indexed), `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing either a single element 0 or two elements: 0 and `n`, `ans` is a list of `n - 1` elements where the last element is calculated based on the number of '>' characters and the index `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is either '<' or '>' character from `s1` at index `i`, `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `zr` is the last element of `suffZero` which is either 0 or `n`. If `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, then `ans[i]` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd`, where `zeroInd` is 2 times the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)` and `oneInd` is 2 times the last element of `preOne` minus the result of `func_1(preOne, 1)`. Otherwise, the last element of `ans` is updated based on the number of '>' characters and the index `i` is `n - 2`.***
