Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements: 0 and n + i + 1, ans is a list of n - 1 elements where the last element is calculated based on the number of '>' characters and the index i is n - 3, el is either '<' or '>' character from s1 at index i, zeroInd is suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2], oneInd is 2 * func_1(preOne, zr), ans[i] is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1.**

The code snippet calculates the value of `zeroInd` by summing the last two elements of the `suffZero` list, and the value of `oneInd` by calling the function `func_1` with arguments `preOne` and `zr`, and then multiplying the result by 2. The value of `ans[i]` is then calculated by subtracting `oneInd` from `zeroInd` and adding `n + 1`. The values of `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, and `el` remain unchanged.
