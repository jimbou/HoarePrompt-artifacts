Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements: 0 and n + i + 1, ans is a list of n - 1 elements where the last element is calculated based on the number of '>' characters and the index i is n - 3, el is either '<' or '>' character from s1 at index i.**

The code modifies the `suffZero` list by appending a new element, which is the last element of `suffZero` plus `i + 1`. This means that the length of `suffZero` increases by 1, and its last element is updated to `n + i + 1`. The variables `ol` and `zr` are assigned the values of `totalOne` and `len(suffZero) - 1`, respectively. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
