Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1 minus 1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1 with the last element removed, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is zeroInd - oneInd if the number of '>' characters is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the last element is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi, i is n - 1, el is '>', ol is the number of '>' characters in s1 minus 1, and zr is 0.**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables as follows:

- The first line removes the last element from the list `preOne`, which contains the cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`. This reduces the length of `preOne` by 1.
- The second line decrements the value of `totalOne` by 1, which represents the number of '>' characters in `s1`. This means there is one less '>' character in `s1`.

All other variables remain unchanged. The state of `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `i`, `el`, `ol`, and `zr` is not affected by the code snippet.
