Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s1` (1-indexed), `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing either a single element 0 or two elements: 0 and `n`, `ans` is a list of `n - 1` elements where the last element is calculated based on the number of '>' characters and the index `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is either '<' or '>' character from `s1` at index `i`, `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `zr` is the last element of `suffZero` which is either 0 or `n`.**

In this output state, the values of `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, and `el` remain unchanged. The new variables `ol` and `zr` are introduced, where `ol` is assigned the value of `totalOne`, which is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, and `zr` is assigned the value of the last element of `suffZero`, which is either 0 or `n`.
