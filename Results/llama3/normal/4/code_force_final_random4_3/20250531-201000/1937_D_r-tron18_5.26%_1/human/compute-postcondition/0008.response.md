Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi, i is n - 1, el is '>', ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, and zr is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `ans[i]` has been updated based on the calculations involving `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, `n`, and `fi`. The values of `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi` are determined by the functions `func_1` and the lists `preOne` and `suffZero`, as well as the variables `zr` and `n`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
