Functionality: **This function searches for a target integer (`find`) within a list of distinct integers (`array`) from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order. It performs a binary search to find the target integer and returns a list containing two strings representing the indices of the target integer and a specific index (`l`) if the target integer is not found at index `l`. If the target integer is found at index `l`, the function prints 0 and does not return a list. If the target integer is not found at index `l`, the function prints 1 and returns a list containing the indices `l + 1` and `array.index(find) + 1`.**
