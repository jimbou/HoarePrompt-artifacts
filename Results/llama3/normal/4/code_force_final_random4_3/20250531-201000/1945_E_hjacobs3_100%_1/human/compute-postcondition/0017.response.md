Postcondition: ***`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is greater than 1. After the if-else block, if `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, `l` is updated to the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`. Otherwise, `r` is updated to the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`.***
