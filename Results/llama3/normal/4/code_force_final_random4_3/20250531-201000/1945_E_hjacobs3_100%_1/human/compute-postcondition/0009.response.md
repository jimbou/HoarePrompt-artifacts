Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is greater than 1, `r - l` must be greater than 1, `mid` is the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`**

In this output state, the value of `mid` is calculated as the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`, which is `(l + r) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `n` and `r - l` are still valid.
