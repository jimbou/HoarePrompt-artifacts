Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is greater than 1, `l` and `r` are updated such that `r - l` equals 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `array` remains unchanged, the value of `find` remains unchanged, and the length of `array` remains unchanged. However, the values of `l` and `r` are updated such that the difference between `r` and `l` is 1. This means that the loop has narrowed down the search range to a single element in the list.
