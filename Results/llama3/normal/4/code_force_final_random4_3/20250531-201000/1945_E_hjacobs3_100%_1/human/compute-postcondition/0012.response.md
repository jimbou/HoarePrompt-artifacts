Postcondition: ***`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is greater than 1. If `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, `r - l` is greater than 0 and `l` is the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`. Otherwise, `r` is the integer part of the average of `l` and `r` and `r - l` is less than or equal to 1.***
