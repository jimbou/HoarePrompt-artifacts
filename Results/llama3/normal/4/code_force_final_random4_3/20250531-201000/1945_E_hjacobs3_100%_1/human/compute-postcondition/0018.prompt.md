Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: array is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, find is an integer from 1 to n, n is the length of array, l is 0, r is the length of array
Code of the loop:
while r - l > 1:
    mid = (l + r) // 2
    if array[mid] <= find:
        l = mid
    else:
        r = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is greater than 1. After the if-else block, `l` and `r` are updated such that `l` is the integer division of the sum of previous `l` and `r` by 2 if `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, otherwise `r` is the integer division of the sum of `l` and the previous value of `r` by 2. `mid` is the integer division of the sum of updated `l` and `r` by 2. The current value of `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find` if `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, otherwise `array[r]` is greater than `find`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is greater than 1. If `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, `r - l` is greater than 0 and `l` is the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`. Otherwise, `r` is the integer part of the average of `l` and `r` and `r - l` is less than or equal to 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is greater than 1. After the if-else block, if `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, `l` is updated to the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`. Otherwise, `r` is updated to the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
