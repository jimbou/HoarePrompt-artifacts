Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly implements the binary search algorithm, which is the core of the solution.
2. The program correctly handles the case where the target element is not found in the array, in which case it prints 0 and returns an empty list.
3. The program correctly handles the case where the target element is found in the array, but its index is not equal to `l` (the left boundary of the search range). In this case, it prints 1 and returns a list containing the indices of the target element and the element at index `l`. This is because swapping these two elements would make the binary search algorithm work correctly.
4. The program correctly handles the case where the target element is found in the array and its index is equal to `l`. In this case, it prints 0 and returns an empty list, indicating that no swaps are needed.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly solves the problem. The use of binary search is efficient, and the handling of the different cases is correct.

Correctness: **True**
