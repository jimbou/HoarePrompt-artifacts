Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`, `r - l` is less than or equal to 1, `mid` is the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to be the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`, which is the same as the value of `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition `r - l` must be greater than 1 is no longer guaranteed to be true, as `r` has been updated to be closer to `l`.
