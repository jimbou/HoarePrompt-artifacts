Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is greater than 1, `r - l` is greater than 1, `mid` is the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`**

In this output state, the value of `mid` is calculated as the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`, which is `(l + r) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged, and their properties are still valid. The list `array` still contains distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is still an integer from 1 to `n`, and `n` is still greater than 1. Additionally, the difference between `r` and `l` is still greater than 1.
