#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, find is an integer from 1 to n.
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
        
    #State: `array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is greater than 1, `l` and `r` are updated such that `r - l` equals 1.
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns a list containing two strings. The first string is the value of `l + 1`, where `l` is an index such that `r - l` equals 1 and `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`. The second string is the value of `array.index(find) + 1`, where `find` is an integer from 1 to `n` and `array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order. Additionally, the number 1 is printed.
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: `array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is greater than 1, `l` and `r` are updated such that `r - l` equals 1, and `l` equals the index of `find` in `array`, and the number 0 is being printed

#Overall this is what the function does:This function searches for a target integer (`find`) within a list of distinct integers (`array`) from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order. It performs a binary search to find the target integer and returns a list containing two strings representing the indices of the target integer and a specific index (`l`) if the target integer is not found at index `l`. If the target integer is found at index `l`, the function prints 0 and does not return a list. If the target integer is not found at index `l`, the function prints 1 and returns a list containing the indices `l + 1` and `array.index(find) + 1`.
