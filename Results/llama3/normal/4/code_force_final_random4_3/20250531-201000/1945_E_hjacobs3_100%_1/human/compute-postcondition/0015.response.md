Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is greater than 1, `r - l` is greater than 0, `mid` is the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`, `l` is the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, which is the integer part of the average of the original `l` and `r`. The other variables remain unchanged. The difference between `r` and `l` is now greater than 0, since `l` has been updated to be closer to `r`.
