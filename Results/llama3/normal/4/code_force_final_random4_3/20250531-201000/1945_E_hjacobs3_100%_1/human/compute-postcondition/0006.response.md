Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is 0, `r` is the integer division of the sum of `l` and the previous value of `r` by 2, and `array[r]` is greater than `find`**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to be the integer division of the sum of `l` and the previous value of `r` by 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `array` still contains distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, and `find` is still an integer from 1 to `n`. The value of `n` is still greater than 1, and `l` is still 0. The value of `array[r]` is still greater than `find`.
