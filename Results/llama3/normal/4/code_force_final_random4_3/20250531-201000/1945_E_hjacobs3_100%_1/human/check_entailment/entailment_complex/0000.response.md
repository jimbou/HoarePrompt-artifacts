Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where a binary search algorithm is applied to an unsorted permutation of integers from 1 to n. The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm so that after the algorithm is executed, the target integer x is found at the index l.

The program first reads the input, which includes the number of test cases, the length of the permutation n, the target integer x, and the permutation itself. It then calls the function func_1, which performs the binary search and returns a list of indices if the target integer is not found at the index l.

The function func_1 first initializes the variables l and r to 0 and n, respectively. It then enters a while loop that continues until r - l is greater than 1. Inside the loop, it calculates the mid index and updates l and r based on whether the value at the mid index is less than or equal to the target integer x.

After the loop, the function checks if the index l is not equal to the index of the target integer x in the permutation. If they are not equal, it prints 1 and returns a list containing the indices l + 1 and array.index(find) + 1. If they are equal, it prints 0.

The program then prints the result of the function call, which is either a list of indices or nothing if the target integer is found at the index l.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, the program is correct. It correctly performs the binary search and returns the indices of the target integer and the index l if the target integer is not found at index l. It also correctly handles the case where the target integer is found at index l.

Correctness: **True**
