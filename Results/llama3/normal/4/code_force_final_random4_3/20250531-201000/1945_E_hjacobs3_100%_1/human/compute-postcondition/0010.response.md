Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is greater than 1, `r - l` must be greater than 0, `mid` is the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`, `l` is the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, which is the integer part of the average of the original `l` and `r`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the condition `r - l` must be greater than 1 is no longer guaranteed, as `l` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, which could potentially make `r - l` equal to 1. However, it is still guaranteed that `r - l` is greater than 0, since `l` is now equal to `mid`, which is less than or equal to `r`.
