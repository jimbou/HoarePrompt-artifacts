The variables in the loop head are `r` and `l`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the difference between `r` and `l`. If `r - l` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r - l` is less than or equal to 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `r - l` must be greater than 1.
State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is greater than 1, `r - l` is greater than 1**
