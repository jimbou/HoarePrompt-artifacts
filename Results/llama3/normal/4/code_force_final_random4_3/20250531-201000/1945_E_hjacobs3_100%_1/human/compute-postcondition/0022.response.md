Output State: **The program returns a list containing two strings. The first string is the value of `l + 1`, where `l` is an index such that `r - l` equals 1 and `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`. The second string is the value of `array.index(find) + 1`, where `find` is an integer from 1 to `n` and `array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order. Additionally, the number 1 is printed.**
