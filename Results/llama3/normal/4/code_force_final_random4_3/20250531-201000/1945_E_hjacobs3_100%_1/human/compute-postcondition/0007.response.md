Postcondition: ***`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is greater than 1. After the if-else block, `l` and `r` are updated such that `l` is the integer division of the sum of previous `l` and `r` by 2 if `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, otherwise `r` is the integer division of the sum of `l` and the previous value of `r` by 2. `mid` is the integer division of the sum of updated `l` and `r` by 2. The current value of `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find` if `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, otherwise `array[r]` is greater than `find`.***
