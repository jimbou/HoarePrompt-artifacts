Output: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is greater than 1, `l` and `r` are updated such that `r - l` equals 1, and the current value of `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`, and the number 1 is being printed**
