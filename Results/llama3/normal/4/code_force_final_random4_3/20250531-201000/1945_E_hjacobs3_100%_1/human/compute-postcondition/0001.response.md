To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `r - l > 1`. The variables involved in this condition are `r` and `l`.

Given the initial state:
- `array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order.
- `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`.
- `n` is the length of `array`.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is the length of `array`.

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `r - l > 1` must be true. Given that `l` is 0 and `r` is the length of `array`, we can substitute these values into the condition to get `r - 0 > 1`, which simplifies to `r > 1`.

Since `r` is the length of `array` and `n` is also the length of `array`, we can infer that `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is the value of `n`. It must be greater than 1.

State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `array`**
