Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x. However, the program only checks if l is equal to the index of the find element in the array, and if not, it prints 1 and returns the indices of l and the find element. This does not guarantee that p_l will be equal to x after the algorithm is executed.

For example, consider the input:

5
1 3 4 2 5

The program will print 1 and return [1, 4], which means it will swap the elements at indices 1 and 4. However, after the swap, the array will be:

3 1 4 2 5

And the algorithm will still not find the element 1 at index l, because l will be 0 and p_l will be 3, not 1.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and the correctness is False.
