Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is the integer division of the sum of previous `l` and `r` by 2, `r` is the length of `array`, `mid` is the integer division of the sum of `l` and `r` by 2. The current value of `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `array` contains distinct integers from 1 to `n` in any order, and the value to be found `find` is an integer between 1 and `n`. The total number of elements `n` is more than 1. The left boundary `l` has been updated to the middle index, which is the integer division of the sum of the previous left boundary and the right boundary by 2. The right boundary `r` remains the length of the array. The middle index `mid` is still the integer division of the sum of the updated left boundary and the right boundary by 2. The value at the middle index of the array is less than or equal to the value to be found.
