Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `array`, `mid` is the integer division of the sum of `l` and `r` by 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The array remains unchanged, containing distinct integers from 1 to n in any order. The value of 'find' is still an integer between 1 and n. The value of n is still greater than 1. The value of 'l' is still 0. The value of 'r' is still the length of the array. A new variable 'mid' is introduced, which is the integer division of the sum of 'l' and 'r' by 2.
