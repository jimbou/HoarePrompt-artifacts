Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using binary search. However, the permutation is not sorted, so the program allows for at most 2 swaps to be made before running the binary search algorithm.

The program first reads the number of test cases `t`, and then for each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the number to be found `x`. It then reads the permutation `p` separated by spaces.

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes the permutation `array` and the number to be found `find` as input. It initializes two variables `l` and `r` to 0 and `n`, respectively, and then enters a while loop that continues until `r - l` is greater than 1.

Inside the loop, the program calculates the midpoint `mid` of `l` and `r` using the formula `(l + r) // 2`. It then checks if the element at index `mid` in the permutation is less than or equal to `find`. If it is, it sets `l` to `mid`. Otherwise, it sets `r` to `mid`.

After the loop, the program checks if the index `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the permutation. If it is not, it prints 1 and returns a list containing the strings `str(l + 1)` and `str(array.index(find) + 1)`. This indicates that one swap is needed to move the element at index `l` to the correct position.

If `l` is equal to the index of `find`, the program prints 0, indicating that no swaps are needed.

The main program then calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
