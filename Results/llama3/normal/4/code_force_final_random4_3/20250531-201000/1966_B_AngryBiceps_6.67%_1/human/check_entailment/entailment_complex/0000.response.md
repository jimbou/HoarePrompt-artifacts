Reasoning: 

The given Python program is incorrect. The program checks if the first row or the first column of the grid contains only one unique character and is not equal to the last row or column, respectively. However, this is not sufficient to determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

For example, consider a grid where the first row and the last row are the same color, but the first column and the last column are different colors. In this case, the program would print 'YES', but it is actually not possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

A correct solution would need to check if there is a row or a column that contains both 'W' and 'B', and if so, check if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by selecting two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them that color.

Correctness: **False**
