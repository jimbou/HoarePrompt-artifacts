Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is an integer, a is an empty list, first_row is an empty string, last_row is an empty string, _ is 0, stdin is empty**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

After executing the code, the variable `n` is assigned a positive integer value from the input, and `m` is assigned an integer value from the input. The list `a` is initialized as an empty list. The variables `first_row` and `last_row` are initialized as empty strings. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. The input buffer `stdin` is now empty, as its contents have been consumed by the `input()` function.
