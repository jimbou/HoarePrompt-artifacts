Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list containing a single string, first_row is a single character, last_row is a single character, _ is 1, stdin is empty, i is 0**

The code block consists of three lines. The first line appends a string from stdin to the list `a`. Since stdin is empty, this line does not modify any variables. The second line appends the first character of the last string in `a` to `first_row`. Since `a` is empty, this line does not modify any variables. The third line appends the last character of the last string in `a` to `last_row`. Since `a` is empty, this line does not modify any variables.

Therefore, the final state of the variables is the same as the initial state, with no changes.
