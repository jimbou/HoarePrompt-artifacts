Output State: **a is a list containing two strings (the original input from stdin and the new input from stdin), first_row is a string containing the first character of the original input from stdin and the first character of the new input from stdin, last_row is a string containing the last character of the original input from stdin and the last character of the new input from stdin, n is an integer greater than 1, m is an integer, _ is 0, i is 1, stdin is empty**

Explanation:
The code appends a new input from stdin to the list `a`, which originally contained a single string (the input from stdin). The first line of the code adds a new string to the end of the list `a`, making it a list of two strings. The second line appends the first character of the new input to the string `first_row`, which originally contained the first character of the original input. The third line appends the last character of the new input to the string `last_row`, which originally contained the last character of the original input. The values of `n`, `m`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The stdin is empty after the execution of the code.
