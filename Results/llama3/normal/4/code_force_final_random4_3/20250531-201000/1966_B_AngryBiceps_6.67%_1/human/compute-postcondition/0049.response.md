To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list containing two strings, `first_row` is a string of two characters, `last_row` is a string of two characters, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2**
