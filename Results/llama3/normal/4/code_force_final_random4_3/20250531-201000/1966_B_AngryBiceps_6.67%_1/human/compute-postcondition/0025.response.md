According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`a` is a list containing a single string (the input from stdin), `first_row` is a string containing the first character of the input from stdin, `last_row` is a string containing the last character of the input from stdin, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, `stdin` is empty**
