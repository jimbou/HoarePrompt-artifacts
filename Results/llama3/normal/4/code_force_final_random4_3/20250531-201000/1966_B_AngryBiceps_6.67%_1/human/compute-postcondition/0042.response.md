Postcondition: ***a is a list containing n strings (the inputs from stdin), first_row is a string containing the first character of each input from stdin, last_row is a string containing the last character of each input from stdin, n is an integer, m is an integer, _ is 0, stdin is empty, i is n-1. If the first string in the list a contains only one unique character and is not equal to the last string in the list a, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if the length of the set of characters in the first_row is 1 and the first_row is not equal to the last_row, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.***
