Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, m is an integer, a is an empty list, first_row is an empty string, last_row is an empty string, _ is 0, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a.append(input())
    first_row += a[-1][0]
    last_row += a[-1][-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer, m is an integer, a is a list containing one string, first_row is a string consisting of the first character of the input string, last_row is a string consisting of the last character of the input string, _ is 0, stdin is empty, i is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is a positive integer greater than 1, m is an integer, a is a list containing two strings, first_row is a string consisting of the first character of the input string and the first character of the second input string, last_row is a string consisting of the last character of the input string and the last character of the second input string, _ is 0, stdin is empty, i is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is a positive integer greater than 1, m is an integer, a is a list containing three strings, first_row is a string consisting of the first character of the input string, the first character of the second input string, and the first character of the third input string, last_row is a string consisting of the last character of the input string, the last character of the second input string, and the last character of the third input string, _ is 0, stdin is empty, i is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
