Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, m is an integer, a is a list containing three strings, first_row is a string of three characters, last_row is a string of three characters, _ is 1, stdin is empty, i is 2**

The code snippet modifies the list `a` by appending a new string input from stdin, which is now empty. The first character of the newly appended string is added to `first_row`, and the last character of the newly appended string is added to `last_row`. The values of `n`, `m`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged.
