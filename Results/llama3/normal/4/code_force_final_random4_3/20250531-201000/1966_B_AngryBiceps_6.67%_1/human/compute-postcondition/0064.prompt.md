Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each consisting of characters 'W' and 'B'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = []
    first_row = ''
    last_row = ''
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(input())
        first_row += a[-1][0]
        last_row += a[-1][-1]
    if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
        print('NO')
    elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer, m is an integer, a is a list containing n strings, first_row is a string consisting of the first character of each input string, last_row is a string consisting of the last character of each input string, _ is 0, stdin is empty, i is n-1. If the first string in the list a has all characters the same and is not equal to the last string in the list a, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if the first_row has only one unique character and is not equal to last_row, 'NO' is printed. In all other cases, 'YES' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *a is a list containing n strings (the inputs from stdin), first_row is a string containing the first character of each input from stdin, last_row is a string containing the last character of each input from stdin, n is an integer, m is an integer, _ is 0, stdin is empty, i is n-1. If the first string in the list a contains only one unique character and is not equal to the last string in the list a, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if the length of the set of characters in the first_row is 1 and the first_row is not equal to the last_row, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list containing n strings, first_row is a string of n characters, last_row is a string of n characters, _ is 1, stdin is empty, i is n-1. If the first string in the list a contains only one unique character and the first string in the list a is not equal to the last string in the list a, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if the length of the set of the first row is 1 and the first row is not equal to the last row, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
