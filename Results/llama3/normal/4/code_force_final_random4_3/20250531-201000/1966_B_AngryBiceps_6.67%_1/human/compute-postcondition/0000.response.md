To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. Since the loop iterates over the range of the integer conversion of the input, we need to ensure that the input is a positive integer.

State: **stdin contains a positive integer t, _ is 0**
