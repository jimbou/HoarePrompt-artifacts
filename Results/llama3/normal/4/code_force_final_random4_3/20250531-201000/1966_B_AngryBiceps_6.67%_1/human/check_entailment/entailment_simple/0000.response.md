Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program checks if the first row and the last row of the grid are the same, and if the first column and the last column are the same. However, this is not sufficient to determine if all squares in the grid can be the same color.

A counterexample is a 3x3 grid with the following configuration:

BWB
WBW
BWB

In this case, the first row and the last row are the same, and the first column and the last column are the same. However, it is not possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

A correct solution would need to check if there is a path of the same color from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, or if there is a path of the same color from the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner.

Correctness: **False**
