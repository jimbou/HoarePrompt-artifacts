The code snippet consists of three lines that modify the variables `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row`. Here's the combined effect of all lines on the program:

The first line appends a new element to the list `a`, which is initially empty. This new element is the input from `stdin`, which is empty. So, `a` becomes a list containing a single string, which is the input from `stdin`.

The second line concatenates the first character of the last element in `a` (which is the input from `stdin`) to the string `first_row`. Since `first_row` is initially an empty string, it becomes a string containing only the first character of the input from `stdin`.

The third line concatenates the last character of the last element in `a` (which is the input from `stdin`) to the string `last_row`. Since `last_row` is initially an empty string, it becomes a string containing only the last character of the input from `stdin`.

The variables `n`, `m`, `_`, `i`, and `stdin` are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **a is a list containing a single string (the input from stdin), first_row is a string containing the first character of the input from stdin, last_row is a string containing the last character of the input from stdin, n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, _ is 0, i is 0, stdin is empty**
