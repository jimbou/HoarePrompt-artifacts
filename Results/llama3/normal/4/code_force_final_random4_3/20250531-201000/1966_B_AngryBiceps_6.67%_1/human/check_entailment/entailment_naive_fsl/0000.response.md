Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the following input:

3 3
WBW
BWB
WBW

The program will output "YES", but it is not possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing any number of operations. The program only checks if the first row and last row are the same color, but it does not consider the case where the first and last columns are different colors.

A correct solution would need to check all rows and columns to ensure that it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.
