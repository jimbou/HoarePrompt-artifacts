Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is an integer, a is a list containing one string, first_row is a string consisting of the first character of the input string, last_row is a string consisting of the last character of the input string, _ is 0, stdin is empty, i is 0**

The code block consists of three lines. The first line appends the input string to the list `a`. Since `a` was initially empty, it now contains one string. The second line appends the first character of the last string in `a` to `first_row`. Since `a` now contains one string, `first_row` will consist of the first character of that string. The third line appends the last character of the last string in `a` to `last_row`. Since `a` now contains one string, `last_row` will consist of the last character of that string. No other variables are affected.
