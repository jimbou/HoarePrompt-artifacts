Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, m is an integer, a is a list containing three strings, first_row is a string consisting of the first character of the input string, the first character of the second input string, and the first character of the third input string, last_row is a string consisting of the last character of the input string, the last character of the second input string, and the last character of the third input string, _ is 0, stdin is empty, i is 2**

In this final state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 1. The value of `m` also remains unchanged as an integer. The list `a` now contains three strings, including the original two strings and the new string appended from the input. The `first_row` string has been updated to include the first character of the third input string, and the `last_row` string has been updated to include the last character of the third input string. The value of `_` remains 0, and `stdin` is still empty. The value of `i` remains 2.
