The only objects in the loop head are variable  _ and stdin, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _.  If the variable _ is less than the number of lines in the stdin the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, stdin is empty. So for the loop to be executed one more time the stdin must not be empty and the variable _ is 0.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list containing `n` strings, `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each input string, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each input string, `_` is 0, stdin is not empty, `i` is `n-1`**
