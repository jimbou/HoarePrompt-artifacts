Output State: **a is a list containing three strings (the original input from stdin, the new input from stdin, and the latest input from stdin), first_row is a string containing the first character of the original input from stdin, the first character of the new input from stdin, and the first character of the latest input from stdin, last_row is a string containing the last character of the original input from stdin, the last character of the new input from stdin, and the last character of the latest input from stdin, n is an integer greater than 2, m is an integer, _ is 0, i is 2, stdin is empty**

The code appends the latest input from stdin to the list `a`, making it contain three strings. The first line adds the first character of the latest input to `first_row`, and the second line adds the last character of the latest input to `last_row`. The values of `n`, `m`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. Stdin remains empty, as all inputs have been processed.
