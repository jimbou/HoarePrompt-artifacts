The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, i is n-1 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0**
