Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is an empty list, first_row is an empty string, last_row is an empty string, _ is 0, stdin is empty, i is n-1**

The code block first reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `m`, respectively. This empties stdin. The subsequent lines initialize `a` as an empty list, and `first_row` and `last_row` as empty strings. The values of `_` and `i` remain unchanged.
