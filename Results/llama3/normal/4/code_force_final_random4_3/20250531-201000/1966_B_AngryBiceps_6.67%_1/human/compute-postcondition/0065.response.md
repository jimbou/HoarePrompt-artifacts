Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The function iterates over a specified number of test cases, each containing a grid of characters 'W' and 'B'. It checks if the first row or the first column of the grid contains only one unique character and is not equal to the last row or column, respectively. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function modifies the input variables n, m, a, first_row, last_row, _, and i, and empties the stdin.**
