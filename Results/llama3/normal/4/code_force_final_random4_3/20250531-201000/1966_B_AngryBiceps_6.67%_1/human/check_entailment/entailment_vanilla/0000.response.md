Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by checking if the first row and last row of the grid have the same color, and if the first column and last column have the same color. If either of these conditions is not met, it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'.

However, this approach is incorrect. The problem statement allows for any number of operations, not just one. Therefore, it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color even if the first row and last row have different colors, or if the first column and last column have different colors.

For example, consider the following grid:

W B
B W

The first row and last row have different colors, and the first column and last column have different colors. However, it is still possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing two operations: first, select the top-left and bottom-right squares and color all squares in the subrectangle between them white, and then select the top-right and bottom-left squares and color all squares in the subrectangle between them white.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
