The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **a is a list containing two strings (the original input from stdin and the new input from stdin), first_row is a string containing the first character of the original input from stdin and the first character of the new input from stdin, last_row is a string containing the last character of the original input from stdin and the last character of the new input from stdin, n is an integer greater than 2, m is an integer, _ is 0, i is 2, stdin is empty**
