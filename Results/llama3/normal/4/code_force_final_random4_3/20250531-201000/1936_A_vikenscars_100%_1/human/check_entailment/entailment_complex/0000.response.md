Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find two indices `i` and `j` in a secret sequence `p` such that `p_i` XOR `p_j` is maximized. The program uses a comparison function `func_1` to compare items in the sequence and determine the maximum.

The program first finds the index of the maximum item in the sequence by comparing each item with the current maximum. This is done in the first loop of `func_2`, where `max_item_idx` is updated whenever a larger item is found.

Next, the program finds the index of the second maximum item by comparing each item with the current maximum and the second maximum. This is done in the second loop of `func_2`, where `pair_idx` is updated whenever a larger item is found that is not equal to the current maximum.

Finally, the program prints the indices of the maximum and second maximum items, which are `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`, respectively.

The program uses at most `3n` queries, where `n` is the length of the secret sequence `p`. This is because the first loop uses `n-1` queries, and the second loop uses at most `n` queries.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
