Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` and returns a string that is either "<", "=", or ">", `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`, and `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    ans1 = func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)
    if ans1 == '<':
        pair_idx = i
    elif ans1 == '=':
        ans2 = func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)
        if ans2 == '>':
            pair_idx = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` and returns a string that is either "<", "=", or ">", `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far, `i` is 0, `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`, `pair_idx` is either the index of the maximum item found so far or 0, and `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`. If `ans1` equals "<", then `pair_idx` is 0. If `ans1` equals "=", then `pair_idx` is either the index of the maximum item found so far or 0, and if `ans2` equals ">", then `pair_idx` is 0, otherwise `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far. If `ans1` does not equal "=", then `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` and returns a string that is either "<", "=", or ">", `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far, `i` is 1, `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`, `pair_idx` is either the index of the maximum item found so far or 1, and `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)` which is either "<", "=", or ">" depending on the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`. If `ans1` is '<', then `pair_idx` is 1. If `ans1` is '=', then `ans2` is the result of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)` which is either "<", "=", or ">" depending on the result of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`. If `ans2` is '>', then `pair_idx` is 1. Otherwise, `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far. If `ans1` is not '=' or '<', then `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` and returns a string that is either "<", "=", or ">", `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far, `i` is 2, `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`, `pair_idx` is either the index of the maximum item found so far or 2, and `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)` which is either "<", "=", or ">" depending on the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`. If `ans1` is '<', then `pair_idx` is 2. If `ans1` is '=', then if `ans2` is '>', then `pair_idx` is 2. Otherwise, `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far. If `ans1` is not '=' or '<', then `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far. If `ans2` is '>', then `pair_idx` is 2, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, 2, max_item_idx, i)`, and `ans2` is the result of `func_1(2, 2, i, i)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
