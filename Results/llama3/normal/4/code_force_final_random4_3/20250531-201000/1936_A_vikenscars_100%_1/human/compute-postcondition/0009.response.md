Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` and returns a string that is either "<", "=", or ">", `i` is 2, and `ans` is either "<", "=", or ">". If `ans` is "<", then `max_item_idx` is 2. Otherwise, `max_item_idx` is 1.***
