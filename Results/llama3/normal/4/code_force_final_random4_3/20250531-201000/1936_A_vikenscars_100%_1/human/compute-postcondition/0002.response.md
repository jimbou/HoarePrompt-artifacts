The code assigns the value of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` to `ans`. Since `max_item_idx` is 0 and `i` is 1, the function `func_1` is called with arguments (0, 0, 1, 1). The function `func_1` returns a string that is either "<", "=", or ">". The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` and returns a string that is either "<", "=", or ">", `max_item_idx` is 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is either "<", "=", or ">"**
