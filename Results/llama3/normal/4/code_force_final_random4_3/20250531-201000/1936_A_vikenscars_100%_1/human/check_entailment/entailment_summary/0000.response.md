Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find two indices i and j in a secret sequence p such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized. The program uses a comparison function `func_1` to compare items in the sequence and determine the maximum and second maximum items.

The program first finds the index of the maximum item by comparing each item with the current maximum. Then, it finds the index of the second maximum item by comparing each item with the current maximum and the second maximum. Finally, it prints the indices of the maximum and second maximum items.

The program uses at most 3n queries to find the maximum and second maximum items, which meets the problem's requirement. The program's logic is correct, and it should be able to find the correct indices for the maximum and second maximum items.

Correctness: **True**
