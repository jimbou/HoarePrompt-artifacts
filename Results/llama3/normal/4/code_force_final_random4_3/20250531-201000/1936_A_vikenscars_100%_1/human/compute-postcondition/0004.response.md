Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` and returns a string that is either "<", "=", or ">", `max_item_idx` is 1, `i` is 1, and the current value of `ans` is "<"**

In this output state, the value of `max_item_idx` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
