Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` and returns a string that is either "<", "=", or ">", `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far, `i` is 0, `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`, `pair_idx` is 0, and `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, 0, max_item_idx, i)` and the current value of `ans1` is '<'.**

In this output state, the value of `pair_idx` has been updated to `i`, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans1` is still '<', but it is now the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, 0, max_item_idx, i)`, since `pair_idx` has been updated to 0.
