Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` and returns a string that is either "<", "=", or ">", `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far, `i` is `n-1`, and `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`**.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `n` remains a positive integer greater than 1, and `func_1` remains a function with the same properties. The variable `max_item_idx` will hold the index of the maximum item found so far, which is the last index `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returned "<". The variable `i` will be `n-1`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all indices from 1 to `n-1`. The variable `ans` will hold the result of the last comparison made by `func_1`, which is the comparison between the maximum item found so far and the last item.
