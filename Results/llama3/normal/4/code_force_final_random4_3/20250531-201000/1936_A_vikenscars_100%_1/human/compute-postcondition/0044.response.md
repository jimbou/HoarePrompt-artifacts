Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` and returns a string that is either "<", "=", or ">", `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`, and `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all indices from 0 to `n-1`, and the `pair_idx` variable has been updated to the index of the maximum item found so far. The `max_item_idx` variable remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the loop. The `i` variable has reached its final value of `n-1`, and the `ans` variable holds the result of the last comparison made by the loop.
