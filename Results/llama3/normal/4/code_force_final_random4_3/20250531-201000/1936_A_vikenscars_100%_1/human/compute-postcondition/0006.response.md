To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` has increased, `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The states of `func_1`, `max_item_idx`, and `ans` are not affected by the loop head, so they remain the same.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` and returns a string that is either "<", "=", or ">", `max_item_idx` is 1 if `ans` is "<", otherwise `max_item_idx` is 0, `i` is 2, and `ans` is either "<", "=", or ">"**
