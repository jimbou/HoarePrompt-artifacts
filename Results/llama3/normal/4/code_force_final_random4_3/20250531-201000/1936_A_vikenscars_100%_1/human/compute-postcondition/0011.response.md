Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` and returns a string that is either "<", "=", or ">", `i` is 3, `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`, and if `ans` is "<", then `max_item_idx` is 3, otherwise, `max_item_idx` is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, a positive integer greater than 3. The function `func_1` still takes four non-negative integers less than `n` and returns a string that is either "<", "=", or ">". The value of `i` is still 3. The value of `ans` is updated to the result of calling `func_1` with the arguments `max_item_idx`, `max_item_idx`, `i`, and `i`. The value of `max_item_idx` is either 3 or 2, depending on the previous value of `ans`.
