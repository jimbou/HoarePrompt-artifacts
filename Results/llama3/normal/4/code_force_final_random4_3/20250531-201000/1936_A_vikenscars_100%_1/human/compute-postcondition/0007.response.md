The code calls the function `func_1` with the arguments `max_item_idx`, `max_item_idx`, `i`, and `i`, and assigns the result to `ans`. The function `func_1` takes four non-negative integers less than `n` and returns a string that is either "<", "=", or ">".


Since `max_item_idx` is 1 if `ans` is "<", otherwise `max_item_idx` is 0, and `ans` is either "<", "=", or ">", we have two possible cases for `max_item_idx`:


1. If `ans` is "<", then `max_item_idx` is 1.


2. If `ans` is not "<", then `max_item_idx` is 0.


In both cases, `i` is 2.


So, the function `func_1` is called with the arguments 1, 1, 2, 2 in the first case, and with the arguments 0, 0, 2, 2 in the second case.


The function `func_1` returns a string that is either "<", "=", or ">".


Therefore, the value of `ans` is either "<", "=", or ">".


The values of the other variables are not affected.


Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` and returns a string that is either "<", "=", or ">", `max_item_idx` is 1 if `ans` is "<", otherwise `max_item_idx` is 0, `i` is 2, and `ans` is either "<", "=", or ">".**
