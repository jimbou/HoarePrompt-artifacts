Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. 

The program uses two functions: `func_1` to ask queries and `func_2` to find the pair of indices with the maximum XOR value.

In `func_2`, the program first finds the index of the maximum item in the sequence by comparing each item with the current maximum. This is done using the `func_1` function to ask queries of the form "? a a b b" and checking the response.

Once the maximum item is found, the program then finds the pair of indices with the maximum XOR value. It does this by iterating over all items and asking queries of the form "? max_item_idx pair_idx max_item_idx i" and "? pair_idx pair_idx i i". If the response to the first query is '<', it updates the pair_idx. If the response is '=', it asks the second query and updates the pair_idx if the response is '>'. This ensures that the pair_idx always has the maximum XOR value with the max_item_idx.

The program then prints the pair of indices with the maximum XOR value.

The program handles all potential cases because it uses the `func_1` function to ask queries and handle the responses, and it uses the `func_2` function to find the pair of indices with the maximum XOR value. The program also ensures that it does not exceed the limit of 3n queries.

Therefore, the program is correct and handles all potential cases.
