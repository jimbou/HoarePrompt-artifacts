Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` and returns a string that is either "<", "=", or ">", `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`, and `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far.**

In this output state, the value of `pair_idx` is updated to be equal to `max_item_idx`, which is the index of the maximum item found so far. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
