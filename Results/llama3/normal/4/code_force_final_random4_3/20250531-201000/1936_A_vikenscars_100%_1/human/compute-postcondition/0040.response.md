Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` and returns a string that is either "<", "=", or ">", `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far, `i` is 2, `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`, `pair_idx` is 2, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, 2, max_item_idx, i)`, and `ans2` is the result of `func_1(2, 2, i, i)`**.

In this output state, the value of `pair_idx` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions that determine the value of `pair_idx` based on `ans1` and `ans2` are no longer relevant, as `pair_idx` is now explicitly set to 2.
