Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` and returns a string that is either "<", "=", or ">", `i` is 3, `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`, and `max_item_idx` is 3 if `ans` is "<", otherwise, `max_item_idx` is 2.***
