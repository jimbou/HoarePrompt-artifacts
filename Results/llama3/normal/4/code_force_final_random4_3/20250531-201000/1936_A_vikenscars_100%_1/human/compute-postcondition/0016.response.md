To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `i` and `n` in the loop head.


According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, `i` is `n-1`, which means it is not within the range of the loop yet. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be within the range of the loop.


Since the loop iterates over the range of `n`, we can adjust `i` to be 0, which is the starting point of the loop.


State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` and returns a string that is either "<", "=", or ">", `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far, `i` is 0, `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`, and `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far**
