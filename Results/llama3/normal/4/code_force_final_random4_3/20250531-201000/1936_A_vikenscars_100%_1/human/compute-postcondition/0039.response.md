Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` and returns a string that is either "<", "=", or ">", `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far, `i` is 2, `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`, `pair_idx` is either the index of the maximum item found so far or 2, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)` which is either "<", "=", or ">" depending on the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`, and `ans2` is the result of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)` which is either "<", "=", or ">" depending on the result of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`. If `ans1` is '<', then `pair_idx` is 2. If `ans1` is '=', then if `ans2` is '>', then `pair_idx` is 2. Otherwise, `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far. If `ans1` is not '=' or '<', then `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the value of `ans2`, which is the result of calling `func_1` with the current values of `pair_idx`, `i`, and `n`. The value of `pair_idx` is updated based on the values of `ans1` and `ans2`, but its possible values remain the same as in the initial state.
