Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` and returns a string that is either "<", "=", or ">", `i` is 3, `max_item_idx` is 3, `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`**

In this output state, the value of `max_item_idx` has been updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is still the result of the function call `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`, but now `max_item_idx` is 3.
