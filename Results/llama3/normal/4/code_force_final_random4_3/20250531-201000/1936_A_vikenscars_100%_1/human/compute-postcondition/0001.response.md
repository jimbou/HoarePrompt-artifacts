To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Since `n` is already a positive integer greater than 1, we can focus on `i`. The loop will execute if `i` is within the range `[1, n)`.

To guarantee the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be within this range. Let's set `i` to 1, which is the smallest possible value in the range.

The state of `func_1` and `max_item_idx` does not affect the execution of the loop, so we can leave them unchanged.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` and returns a string that is either "<", "=", or ">", `max_item_idx` is 0, `i` is 1**
