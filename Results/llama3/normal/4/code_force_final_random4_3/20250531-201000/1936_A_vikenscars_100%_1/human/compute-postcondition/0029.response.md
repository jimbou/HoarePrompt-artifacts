Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` and returns a string that is either "<", "=", or ">", `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far, `i` is 1, `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`, `pair_idx` is either the index of the maximum item found so far or 0, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`, and `ans1` is either "<", "=", or ">" depending on the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `ans1` has been updated to the result of the function `func_1` called with the arguments `max_item_idx`, `pair_idx`, `max_item_idx`, and `i`. The value of `ans1` can be any of the three possible return values of `func_1`: "<", "=", or ">".
