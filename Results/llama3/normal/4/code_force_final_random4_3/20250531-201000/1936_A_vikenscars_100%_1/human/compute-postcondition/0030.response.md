Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` and returns a string that is either "<", "=", or ">", `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far, `i` is 1, `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`, `pair_idx` is 1, and `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)` which is either "<", "=", or ">" depending on the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`.**

In this output state, the value of `pair_idx` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The function `func_1` still takes four non-negative integers less than `n` and returns a string that is either "<", "=", or ">". The index of the maximum item found so far is still stored in `max_item_idx`, and `ans` is still the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`. The value of `ans1` is still dependent on the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`, which can be either "<", "=", or ">".
