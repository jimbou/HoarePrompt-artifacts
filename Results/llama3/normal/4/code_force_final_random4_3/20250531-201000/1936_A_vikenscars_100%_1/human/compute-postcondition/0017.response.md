Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` and returns a string that is either "<", "=", or ">", `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far, `i` is 0, `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`, `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far, and `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` is the result of calling the function `func_1` with the arguments `max_item_idx`, `pair_idx`, `max_item_idx`, and `i`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
