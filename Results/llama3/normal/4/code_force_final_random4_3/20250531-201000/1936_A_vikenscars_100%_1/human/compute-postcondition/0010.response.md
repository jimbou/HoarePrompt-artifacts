State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` and returns a string that is either "<", "=", or ">", `i` is 3, and `ans` is either "<", "=", or ">". If `ans` is "<", then `max_item_idx` is 3. Otherwise, `max_item_idx` is 2.**
