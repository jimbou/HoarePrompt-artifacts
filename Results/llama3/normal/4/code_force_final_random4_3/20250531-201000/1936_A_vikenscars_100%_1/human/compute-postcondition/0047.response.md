Functionality: **This function finds the index of the maximum item in a set of n items, where n is a positive integer greater than 1. It uses a comparison function `func_1` to compare items and determine the maximum. The function first finds the index of the maximum item by comparing each item with the current maximum. Then, it finds the index of the second maximum item by comparing each item with the current maximum and the second maximum. Finally, it prints the indices of the maximum and second maximum items.**
