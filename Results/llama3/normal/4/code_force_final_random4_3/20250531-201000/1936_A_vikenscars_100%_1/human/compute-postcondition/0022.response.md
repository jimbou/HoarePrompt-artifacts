Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` and returns a string that is either "<", "=", or ">", `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far, `i` is 0, `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`, `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)` and equals "=", and `ans2` is the result of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `ans2` which is assigned the result of calling the function `func_1` with the arguments `pair_idx`, `pair_idx`, `i`, and `i`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
