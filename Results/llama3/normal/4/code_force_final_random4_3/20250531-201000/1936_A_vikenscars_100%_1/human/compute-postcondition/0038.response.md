Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` and returns a string that is either "<", "=", or ">", `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far, `i` is 2, `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`, `pair_idx` is 2, and `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, 2, max_item_idx, i)` which is either "<", "=", or ">" depending on the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, 2, max_item_idx, i)`. If `ans1` is '<', then `ans2` is the result of `func_1(2, 2, i, i)` which is either "<", "=", or ">" depending on the result of `func_1(2, 2, i, i)`. If `ans2` is '>', then `pair_idx` is 2. Otherwise, `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far. If `ans1` is not '=' or '<', then `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `pair_idx` is updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans1` is updated to the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, 2, max_item_idx, i)`, and if `ans1` is '<', then `ans2` is updated to the result of `func_1(2, 2, i, i)`. The value of `pair_idx` is either 2 or the index of the maximum item found so far, depending on the values of `ans1` and `ans2`.
