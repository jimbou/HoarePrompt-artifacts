Based on the precondition, we can analyze the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

* `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum item found so far. Since `i` is `n-1`, it means that the maximum item is found at the last index of the sequence (since `i` is the current index being processed).
* `pair_idx` is also the index of the maximum item found so far, which is the same as `max_item_idx`.

Now, let's look at the print statement:
```
print(f'! {max_item_idx} {pair_idx}')
```
The print statement uses an f-string to format the output. The `!` is a literal character, and `{max_item_idx}` and `{pair_idx}` are placeholders for the values of the variables.

Since `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` are the same, the output will be:
```
! n-1 n-1
```
Here, `n-1` is the value of `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`, which is the index of the maximum item found so far.

Output: **! [n-1] [n-1] (where n-1 is the index of the maximum item found so far)**
