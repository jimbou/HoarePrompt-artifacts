The code prints the sum of the integer division of `m` by `a`, the integer division of `m` by `b`, and 2. Where `m` is an integer greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`, and `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive).

Output: **m // a + m // b + 2 (where m is an integer greater than or equal to both a and b, and a and b are integers between 1 and 10^18)**
