This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of three integers a, b, and m. For each case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to make a and b equal to m, which is either 2 if m is less than a or b, or the sum of m divided by a, m divided by b, and 2 otherwise. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.
