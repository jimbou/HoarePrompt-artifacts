The code prints the result of the expression `m // a + m // b + 2`, where `m`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the standard input.

Since `m`, `a`, and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), the expression `m // a` calculates the integer division of `m` by `a`, and `m // b` calculates the integer division of `m` by `b`. The results of these divisions are then added together and 2 is added to the sum.

The value of `m // a` is the largest integer less than or equal to `m/a`, and the value of `m // b` is the largest integer less than or equal to `m/b`. The sum of these two values plus 2 is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^18 + 2 (inclusive).

Output: **an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^18 + 2 (inclusive), which is the result of the expression m // a + m // b + 2**
