Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, `m` are integers (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18). If `m` is less than `a` or `m` is less than `b`, the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`, and the value of `m // a + m // b + 2` is printed.***
