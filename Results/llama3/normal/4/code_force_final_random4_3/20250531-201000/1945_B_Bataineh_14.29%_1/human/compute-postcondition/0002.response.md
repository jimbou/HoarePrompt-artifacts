The code accepts three integers a, b, m from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin contains t lines, each containing three integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18). The values of the other variables are not affected. Since stdin now contains t-1 lines, we will include it in the output state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, `m` are integers (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18)**
