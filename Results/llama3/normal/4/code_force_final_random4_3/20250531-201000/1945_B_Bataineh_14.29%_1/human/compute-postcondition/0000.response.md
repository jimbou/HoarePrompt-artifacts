Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines, each containing three integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18)**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin now contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`, where each of these integers is between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive).
