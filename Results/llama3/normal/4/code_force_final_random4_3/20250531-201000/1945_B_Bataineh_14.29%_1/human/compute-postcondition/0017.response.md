The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `m` are integers (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18). If `m` is less than `a` or `m` is less than `b`, the number 2 is being printed. Otherwise, the value of the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` is being printed.**
