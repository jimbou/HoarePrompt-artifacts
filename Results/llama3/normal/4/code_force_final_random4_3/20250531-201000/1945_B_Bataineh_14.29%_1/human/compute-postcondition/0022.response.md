Output: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `m` are integers (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing three integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18). If `m` is less than `a` or `m` is less than `b`, the number 2 is being printed. Otherwise, the value of the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` is being printed.**
