Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `m` are integers (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18).**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to the integers read from the input, which are between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive). The stdin now contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), since one line has been read and processed.
