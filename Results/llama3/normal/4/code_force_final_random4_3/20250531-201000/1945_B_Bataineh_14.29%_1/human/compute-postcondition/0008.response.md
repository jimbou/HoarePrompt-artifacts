The code prints the value of `m // a + m // b + 2`, where `m`, `a`, and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), and `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`. The value of `m // a` is the integer division of `m` by `a`, and similarly for `m // b`. The sum of these two values plus 2 is then printed.
Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, `m` are integers (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18). Additionally, m is greater than or equal to both a and b, and the value of `m // a + m // b + 2` is printed**
