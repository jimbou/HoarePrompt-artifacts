Reasoning:
The given Python program is correct. It accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The program correctly handles the cases where m is less than a or b, and where m is greater than or equal to a and b. In the former case, it prints 2, as the problem statement explains that in this scenario, it is possible to see no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously. In the latter case, it calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time by adding the number of fireworks launched by the first installation (m // a), the number of fireworks launched by the second installation (m // b), and 2 (to account for the fireworks that are visible for one minute). This calculation is consistent with the problem statement and the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
