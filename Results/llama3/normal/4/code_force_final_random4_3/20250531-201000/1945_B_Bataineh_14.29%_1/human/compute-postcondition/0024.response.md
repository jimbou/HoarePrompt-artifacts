Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is `t`, `a`, `b`, `m` are integers (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), stdin is empty. If `m` is less than `a` or `m` is less than `b`, the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, the value of the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), and the variable `i` will be equal to `t`. The variables `a`, `b`, and `m` will still be integers between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive). The standard input (stdin) will be empty, as all the input lines will have been processed by the loop. The loop will have printed either the number 2 or the result of the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` for each iteration, depending on the values of `m`, `a`, and `b`.
