Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `m` are integers (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing three integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18). If `m` is less than `a` or `m` is less than `b`, the number 2 is being printed. Otherwise, the value of the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` is being printed.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to the new values read from the input. The stdin now contains `t-4` lines, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, `m`. The condition for printing the number 2 or the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` is still valid.
