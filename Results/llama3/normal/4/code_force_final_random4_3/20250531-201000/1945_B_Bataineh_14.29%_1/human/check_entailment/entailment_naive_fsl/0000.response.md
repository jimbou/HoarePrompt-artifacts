Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when `m` is equal to `a` or `b`. In this case, the program prints `2`, but the correct answer should be `m // a + m // b + 1` or `m // a + m // b + 2` depending on whether `a` or `b` is equal to `m`. 

For example, if `a = 5`, `b = 5`, and `m = 5`, the program will print `2`, but the correct answer is `3` because there will be one firework from each installation visible at the same time, and one more firework from each installation will be visible for one minute after the previous one.

The correct code should be:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)
```

This code correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time by dividing `m` by `a` and `b` and adding `2` to account for the fireworks that are visible for one minute after the previous ones.
