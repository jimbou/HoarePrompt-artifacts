Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 3, `j` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 0, `p` is the element of `l` at index 2, `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `q` is equal to `i + 1` then `j` is set to 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In natural language, the output state is: `n` is still a positive integer greater than 2, `l` is still a list of integers, `i` has been incremented by 1 and is now 3, `j` remains either 0 or 1, `_` is still 0, `p` is still the element of `l` at index 2, `q` is still the element of `l` at index `p - 1`, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The condition regarding `j` being set to 1 if `q` is equal to `i + 1` is still applicable, but since `i` has changed, the condition is now `q` being equal to 4.
