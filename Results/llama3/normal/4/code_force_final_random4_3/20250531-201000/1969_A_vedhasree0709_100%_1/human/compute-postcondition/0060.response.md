The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer. `n` being an integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer from stdin and `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a list of integers from stdin, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
