The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` was 2, so the new value of `i` is 3. The value of `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`, and `p` is the element of `l` at index 2. The value of `j` depends on whether `q` is equal to `i + 1`. Since `i` is now 3, `j` is 1 if `q` is equal to 4, and 0 otherwise. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 3, `_` is 1, `p` is the element of `l` at index 2, `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`, and `j` is 1 if `q` is equal to 4, and 0 otherwise.**
