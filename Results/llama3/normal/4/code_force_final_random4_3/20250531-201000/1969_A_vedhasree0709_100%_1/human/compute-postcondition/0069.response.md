Output State: **n is an integer from stdin and n is greater than i, l is a list of integers from stdin, i is either 0 + 1 or remains unchanged, j is 1, p is the element of l at index i, q is the element of l at index p - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `p` has been updated to be the element of `l` at index `i`, and the value of `q` has been updated to be the element of `l` at index `p - 1`. The values of `n`, `l`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
