The only objects in the loop head are variable `_` and `input()`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed, the input must be greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, `_` is 0, input() must be greater than 0**
