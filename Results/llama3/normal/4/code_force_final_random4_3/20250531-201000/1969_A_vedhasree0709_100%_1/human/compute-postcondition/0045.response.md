Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `j` is 1 if `q` is equal to 2, otherwise `j` is 0, `_` is 1, `p` is the element of `l` at index 2, `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `q` is equal to 2, then the number 2 is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The value of `p` is now the element of `l` at index 2, and the value of `q` is now the element of `l` at index `p - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for printing the number 2 is still dependent on the value of `q` being equal to `i + 1`, which is now 2.
