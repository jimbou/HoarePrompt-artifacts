Postcondition: ***n is an integer from stdin and n is greater than or equal to i + 2, l is a list of integers from stdin, i is either 1 + 1 or remains unchanged + 1, j is 1, p is the element of l at index i, q is the element of l at index p - 1. If q is equal to i + 1, then the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
