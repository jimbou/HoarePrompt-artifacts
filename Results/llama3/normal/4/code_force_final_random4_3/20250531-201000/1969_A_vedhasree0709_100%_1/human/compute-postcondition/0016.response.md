Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `j` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 0, `p` is the element of `l` at index 2, `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `q` equals 2 plus 1, then `j` is 1. Otherwise, `j` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The values of `n`, `l`, `_` remain unchanged. The value of `p` is now the element of `l` at index 2, and the value of `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`. The value of `j` is still either 0 or 1, and it will be 1 if `q` equals 2 plus 1, otherwise, it remains unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.
