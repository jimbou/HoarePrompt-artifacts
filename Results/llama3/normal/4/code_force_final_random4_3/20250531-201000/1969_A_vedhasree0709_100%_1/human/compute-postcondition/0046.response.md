The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 2. `n` being at least 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `j` is 1 if `q` is equal to 2, otherwise `j` is 0, `_` is 1, `p` is the element of `l` at index 2, `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `q` is equal to 2, then the number 2 is being printed.**
