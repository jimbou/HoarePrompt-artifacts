Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 0, `p` is the first element of `l`, `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `q` is equal to `i + 1`, then `j` is set to 1. Otherwise, `j` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `q` and `j` are still valid. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
