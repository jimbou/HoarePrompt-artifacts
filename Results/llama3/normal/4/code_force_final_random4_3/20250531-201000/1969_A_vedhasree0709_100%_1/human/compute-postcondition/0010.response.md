The variable in the loop head is variable i and n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and n. If i is less than or equal to n - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 1, n is a positive integer. n being a positive integer does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to n is greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 0, `p` is the first element of `l`, `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `q` is equal to `i + 1`, then `j` is set to 1. Otherwise, `j` remains unchanged.**
