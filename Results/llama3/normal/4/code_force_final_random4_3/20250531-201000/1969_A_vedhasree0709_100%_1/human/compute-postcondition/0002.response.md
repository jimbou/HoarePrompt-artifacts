To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition `i <= n - 1`.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.

The loop condition depends on `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`. Since `i` is 0, this condition is satisfied if `n` is greater than 0. Given that `n` is already stated to be a positive integer, no adjustment to `n` is necessary to ensure the loop can execute at least once. The value of `i` being 0 also satisfies the condition without needing any adjustment.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states of `i` and `n` for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers**
