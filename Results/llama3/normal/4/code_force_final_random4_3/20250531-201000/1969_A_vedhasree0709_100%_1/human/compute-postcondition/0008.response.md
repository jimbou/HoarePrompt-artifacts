Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, l is a list of integers, i is 0, j is either 0 or 1, _ is 0, p is the first element of l, q is the element of l at index p - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If q is equal to i + 1, then j is set to 1. Otherwise, j remains unchanged.***
