Postcondition: ***n is at least 2, l is a list of integers, i is 1, j is 1 if q is equal to i + 1, otherwise j is 0, _ is 1, p is the element of l at index i, q is the element of l at index p - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If q is equal to i + 1, then the number 2 is being printed.***
