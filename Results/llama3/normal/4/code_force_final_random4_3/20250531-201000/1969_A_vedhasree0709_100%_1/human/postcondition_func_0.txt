This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of distinct integers from 1 to n. It then checks if the list contains a cycle of length 2 by iterating through the list and checking if the element at index i is equal to i+1. If such a cycle is found, it prints 2 and stops. If no such cycle is found after iterating through the entire list, it prints 3. The function does not modify the input variables and only prints the result to standard output.
