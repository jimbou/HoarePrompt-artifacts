The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 0, so the new value of `i` is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 1 if `q` is equal to `i + 1`, otherwise `j` is 0, `_` is 1, `p` is the element of `l` at index `i`, `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.**
