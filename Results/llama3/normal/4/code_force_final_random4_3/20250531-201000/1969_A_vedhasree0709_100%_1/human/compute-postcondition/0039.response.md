To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0.

To guarantee the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than or equal to `n - 1`. Since `i` is 1, we need to make sure that `n` is at least 2.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 1 if `q` is equal to `i + 1`, otherwise `j` is 0, `_` is 1, `p` is the element of `l` at index `i`, `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.**
