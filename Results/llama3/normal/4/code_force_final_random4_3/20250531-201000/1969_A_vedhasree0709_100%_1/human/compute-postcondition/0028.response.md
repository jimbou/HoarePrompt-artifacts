Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 0, `p` is the last element of `l`, `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `j` is 0, the number 3 is being printed.***
