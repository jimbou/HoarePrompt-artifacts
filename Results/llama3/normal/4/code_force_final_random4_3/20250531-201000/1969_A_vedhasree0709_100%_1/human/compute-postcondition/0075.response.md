To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 1 + 1 or remains unchanged + 1, and `n` is greater than `i`.

To guarantee the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than or equal to `n - 1`. Since `i` can increase by 1, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than the new value of `i`.

Let's assume the new value of `i` is `i + 1`. Then, we need `n` to be greater than `i + 1`. Since `n` is already greater than `i`, we can conclude that `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 2`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer from stdin and `n` is greater than or equal to `i + 2`, `l` is a list of integers from stdin, `i` is either 1 + 1 or remains unchanged + 1, `j` is 1, `p` is the element of `l` at index `i`, `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`.**
