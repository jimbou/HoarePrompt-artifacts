Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (greater than 1) and then a list of distinct integers (from 1 to the integer) of the same length as the integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i <= n - 1:
        p = l[i]
        q = l[p - 1]
        if q == i + 1:
            print(2)
            j = 1
            break
        i += 1
    if j == 0:
        print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 0, `p` is the last element of `l`, `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `j` is 0, the number 3 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer, l is a list of integers, i is n, j is either 0 or 1, _ is 1, p is the last element of l, q is the element of l at index p - 1. If j is 0, the number 3 is being printed. Otherwise, no additional actions are performed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer from stdin, `l` is a list of integers from stdin, `i` is `n`, `j` is 1. If `j` is 0, then the current value of `i` is `n`, the current value of `j` is 0, and the number 3 is being printed. Otherwise, no change occurs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
