Output State: **`n` is an integer from stdin and `n` is greater than or equal to `i + 2`, `l` is a list of integers from stdin, `i` is either 2 or remains unchanged + 1, `j` is 1, `p` is the element of `l` at index `i`, `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`. If `q` is equal to `i + 1`, then the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 2 or remains unchanged + 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition `n` is greater than or equal to `i + 2` is still valid, as `n` is still an integer from stdin and `i` has only increased by 1. The list `l` and the variables `j`, `p`, and `q` are also unchanged. The condition for printing the number 2 is still dependent on the value of `q` being equal to `i + 1`.
