Postcondition: ***n is an integer from stdin and n is greater than or equal to 0, l is a list of integers from stdin, if the value of q is equal to i + 1, then i is 0, j is 1, p is the first element of l, q is the element of l at index p - 1, and the number 2 has been printed. Otherwise, the values of i, j, p, and q remain unchanged.***
