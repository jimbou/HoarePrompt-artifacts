To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as there are more inputs to read from `stdin`. The variable `_` is used to iterate over the range of inputs, but it's not directly related to the state of the other variables.

Since the loop head only involves the variable `_` and the `input()` function, we can only adjust the state of `_` and the input stream.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and there are multiple test cases minus 2 inputs left in `stdin`. For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more input left in `stdin`, and `_` should be incremented to 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 1, `p` is the last element of `l`, `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `j` is 0, the number 3 is being printed.**
