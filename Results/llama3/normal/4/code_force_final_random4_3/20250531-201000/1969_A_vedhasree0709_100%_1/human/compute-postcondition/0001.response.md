Output State: **n is a positive integer, l is a list of integers, i is 0, j is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers**

The code snippet reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, then reads a space-separated list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `l`. The variables `i` and `j` are initialized to 0. The variable `_` remains unchanged at 0. After the code executes, stdin contains multiple test cases minus the two inputs that were read.
