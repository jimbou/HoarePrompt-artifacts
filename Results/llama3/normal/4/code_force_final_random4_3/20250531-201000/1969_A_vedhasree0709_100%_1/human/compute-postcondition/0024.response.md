Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is `n`, `j` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 0, `p` is the last element of `l`, `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   `n` remains a positive integer.
*   `l` remains a list of integers.
*   `i` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has iterated `n` times.
*   `j` is either 0 or 1, depending on whether the condition `q == i + 1` was ever true during the loop's execution. If it was true, `j` is set to 1; otherwise, it remains 0.
*   `_` remains 0.
*   `p` is the last element of `l`, which was accessed during the last iteration of the loop.
*   `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`, which was accessed during the last iteration of the loop.
*   The stdin remains unchanged, containing multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.
