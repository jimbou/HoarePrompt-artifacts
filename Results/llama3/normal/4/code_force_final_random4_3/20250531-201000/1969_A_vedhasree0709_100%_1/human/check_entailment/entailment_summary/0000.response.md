Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to have at least 2 friends at his party.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of friends and the list of their best friends. It then checks if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (i.e., a cycle of length 2). If such a pair is found, it prints 2, because Monocarp only needs to send invitations to these two friends. If no such pair is found, it prints 3, because Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least three friends to have at least two friends at the party.

The program's logic is correct and it handles all possible cases. It also does not modify the input variables and only prints the result to standard output, as required.

Correctness: **True**
