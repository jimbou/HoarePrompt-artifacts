Output State: **`n` is an integer from stdin and `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a list of integers from stdin, `i` is either 0 + 1 or remains unchanged, `j` is 1, `p` is the first element of `l`, `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1` if `q` is equal to `i + 1`, otherwise `q` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is an integer from stdin and is greater than or equal to 0. The list `l` also remains unchanged as it is a list of integers from stdin. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 if `q` is equal to `i + 1`, otherwise, it remains unchanged. The value of `j` remains unchanged as 1. The value of `p` remains unchanged as the first element of `l`. The value of `q` remains unchanged if `q` is not equal to `i + 1`, otherwise, it is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`.
