To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved are `_` and the input value.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and the input value is not explicitly stated, but we know that `_` is incremented by 1 at each iteration.

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be less than the input value. Since `_` is currently 1, it will be incremented to 2 at the start of the next iteration.

The input value remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables `n`, `l`, `i`, `j`, `p`, and `q` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is `n`, `j` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 2, `p` is the last element of `l`, `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`**
