Output State: **n is an integer from stdin and n is greater than or equal to i + 2, l is a list of integers from stdin, i is either 1 + 1 or remains unchanged + 1, j is 1, p is the element of l at index i, q is the element of l at index p - 1.**

The code snippet provided does not modify the values of `n`, `l`, `i`, or `j`. The first line assigns the value of the element at index `i` in list `l` to `p`. The second line assigns the value of the element at index `p - 1` in list `l` to `q`. Since `i` is either 1 + 1 or remains unchanged + 1, and `p` is the element of `l` at index `i`, the value of `p` is the element of `l` at index `i`. Similarly, since `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`, the value of `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `l` remains a list of integers from stdin. The value of `i` is either 1 + 1 or remains unchanged + 1, and `j` remains 1.
