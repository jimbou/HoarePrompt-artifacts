Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers less than 2^31 that is not empty, `num` is the first number in the list. If `num` is not in the dictionary `count`, then `res` is 1 and `count` is a dictionary that contains the key `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` with a value of 1. Otherwise, `res` is 0 and the count of `num` in the dictionary `count` is decreased by 1.***
