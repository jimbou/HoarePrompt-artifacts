Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than 2^31 that is not empty, num is the second number in the list, count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] is 1 more than its previous value, res is 1 more than its previous value.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The list `a` also remains unchanged with `n` non-negative integers less than 2^31 and is not empty. The value of `num` is still the second number in the list. The count of `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` in the dictionary `count` has been incremented by 1. The value of `res` has also been incremented by 1.
