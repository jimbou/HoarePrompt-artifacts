Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers less than 2^31 that must have at least 3 numbers, `num` is the third number in the list, `count[num]` is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `count[num]` is decreased by 1, where `num` is the third number in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains `n` non-negative integers less than 2^31, and `num` is still the third number in the list. The value of `n` is still a positive integer.
