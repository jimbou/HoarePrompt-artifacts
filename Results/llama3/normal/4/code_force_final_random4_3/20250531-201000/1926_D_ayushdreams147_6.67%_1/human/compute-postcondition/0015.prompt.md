Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than 2^31, res is 0, count is an empty dictionary
Code of the loop:
for num in a:
    if num not in count:
        count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
        res += 1
    else:
        count[num] -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers less than 2^31 that is not empty, `num` is the first number in the list. If `num` is not in the dictionary `count`, then `res` is 1 and `count` is a dictionary that contains the key `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` with a value of 1. Otherwise, `res` is 0 and the count of `num` in the dictionary `count` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers less than 2^31 that is not empty, `num` is the second number in the list. If `num` is in `count`, `count[num]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is 1 more than its previous value and `res` is 1 more than its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers less than 2^31 that must have at least 3 numbers, `num` is the third number in the list. If `num` is in `count`, then `count[num]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is 1 more than its original value and `res` is 1 more than its original value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
