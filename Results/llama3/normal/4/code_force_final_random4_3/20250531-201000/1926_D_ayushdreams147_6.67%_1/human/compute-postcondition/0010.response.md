Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers less than 2^31 that is not empty, `num` is the second number in the list. If `num` is in `count`, `count[num]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is 1 more than its previous value and `res` is 1 more than its previous value.***
