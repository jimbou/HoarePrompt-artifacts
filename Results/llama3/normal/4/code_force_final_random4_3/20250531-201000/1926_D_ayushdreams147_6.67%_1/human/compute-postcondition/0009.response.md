The value of `count[num]` is decreased by 1. The value of `num` is the second number in the list `a`. The value of `n` is still a positive integer and `a` is still a list of `n` non-negative integers less than 2^31 that is not empty. The value of `count[num]` is decreased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers less than 2^31 that is not empty, `num` is the second number in the list, `count[num]` is decreased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers less than 2^31 that is not empty, `num` is the second number in the list, `count[num]` is decreased by 1**
