Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers less than 2^31 that must have at least 3 numbers, `num` is the third number in the list. If `num` is in `count`, then `count[num]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is 1 more than its original value and `res` is 1 more than its original value.***
