To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is the first number in the list `a`. For the loop to execute again, `num` needs to be the next number in the list `a`. Since `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, we can assume that the list has at least two elements.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers less than 2^31 that is not empty, `num` is the second number in the list.**

Note that we don't need to adjust the states of `res` and `count` because they are not part of the loop head.
