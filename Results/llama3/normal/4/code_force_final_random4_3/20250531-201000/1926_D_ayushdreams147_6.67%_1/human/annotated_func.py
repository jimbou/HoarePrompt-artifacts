#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and a is a list of n non-negative integers less than 2^31.
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, a is an empty list, res is the number of unique integers in the original list a, count is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in the original list a and the values are all 0.
    return res
    #The program returns the number of unique integers in the original list 'a', which is 0 since 'a' is an empty list.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns the number of unique integers in the list. The function modifies the input list to empty and creates a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers from the original list and the values are all 0. The function's primary purpose is to count the unique integers in the input list.
