Output State: **`t` is 0, `_` is `t`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains no test cases.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variable `_` will be equal to the initial value of `t`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` will still be within their respective ranges, but their values will be the last values read from the input. The standard input `stdin` will be empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
