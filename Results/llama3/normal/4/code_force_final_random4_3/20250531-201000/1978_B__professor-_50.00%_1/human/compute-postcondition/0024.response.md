Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. If `b` is greater than `a`, the program prints the sum of the arithmetic series from `a` to `b` with `n` terms. If `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program prints the value `(2 * [b] - [n] + 1) * [n] / 2`. Otherwise, the program prints the product of the average of `a` and `b` and `n`, where the average of `a` and `b` is calculated as `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n`***
