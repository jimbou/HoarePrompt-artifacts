Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9) â€” the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if b <= a:
        print(n * a)
    elif b - a >= n:
        print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
    else:
        print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the product of `n` and `a` is being printed. If `b` is greater than `a`, then if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the sum of all integers from `b - n + 1` to `b` is being printed. Otherwise, the sum of the arithmetic series with first term `a`, last term `b`, and `n` terms is being printed, which is equal to the integer part of ((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. If `b` is greater than `a`, the program prints the sum of the arithmetic series from `a` to `b` with `n` terms. If `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program prints the value `(2 * [b] - [n] + 1) * [n] / 2`. Otherwise, the program prints the product of the average of `a` and `b` and `n`, where the average of `a` and `b` is calculated as `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the product of `n` and `a` is being printed. Otherwise, if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program prints the integer part of the product of `(2 * b - n + 1)` and `n` divided by 2. Otherwise, the program prints the sum of the arithmetic series with first term `a`, last term `b`, and `n` terms, calculated as the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
