Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from stdin, splits it into three integers, and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`, respectively. Since stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, after reading one line of input, there are still multiple test cases minus one left in stdin. The values of `t` and `_` are not affected by this code.
