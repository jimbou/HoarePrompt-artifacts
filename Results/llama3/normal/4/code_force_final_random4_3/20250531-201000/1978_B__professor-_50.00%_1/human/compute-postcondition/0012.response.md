Output: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. `b` is greater than `a`. The difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`, and the sum of the arithmetic series with first term `a`, last term `b`, and `n` terms is being printed, which is equal to the integer part of ((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)**
