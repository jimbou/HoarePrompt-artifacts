Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 0, and the value of `_` remains 0. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values of the three integers from the input, which are between 1 and 10^9. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one, as one test case has been read and processed.
