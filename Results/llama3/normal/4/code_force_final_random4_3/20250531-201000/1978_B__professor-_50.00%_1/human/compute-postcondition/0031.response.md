The code prints the result of a mathematical expression involving the variables `a`, `b`, and `n`. The expression calculates the sum of an arithmetic series with `n` terms, where the first term is `a` and the last term is `b`. The formula used is the sum of an arithmetic series: `n * (a + b) / 2`, but in this case, it's modified to `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n`.

Since `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, the result of the expression will be a large integer.

Output: **the sum of an arithmetic series with n terms, where the first term is a and the last term is b, calculated as (b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n**
