The code prints the result of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`, which is an integer value.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

* `2 * b` is an integer value between 2 and 2 * 10^9 (since `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9).
* `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9.
* `2 * b - n + 1` is an integer value between 2 and 2 * 10^9 - 10^9 + 1 = 10^9 + 1.
* `(2 * b - n + 1) * n` is an integer value between 2 * 10^9 and (10^9 + 1) * 10^9 = 10^18 + 10^9.
* Finally, dividing the result by 2 gives an integer value between 10^9 and (10^18 + 10^9) / 2 = 5 * 10^17 + 5 * 10^8.

So, the output will be an integer value within this range.

Output: **an integer value between 10^9 and 5 * 10^17 + 5 * 10^8**
