Output: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and the sum of the arithmetic series from `a` to `b` with `n` terms is being printed, where the sum is calculated as the product of the average of `a` and `b` and `n`, and the average of `a` and `b` is calculated as `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n`**
