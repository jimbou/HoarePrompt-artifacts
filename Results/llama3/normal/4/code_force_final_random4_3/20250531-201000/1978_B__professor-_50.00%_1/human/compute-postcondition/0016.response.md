Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the input values from the stdin, which are integers between 1 and 10^9. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two, as one test case has been read and processed.
