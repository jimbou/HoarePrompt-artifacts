The code prints the result of the formula `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`, where `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9.
Output: ** `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and this is printed: `(2 * [b] - [n] + 1) * [n] / 2`**
