Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the product of `n` and `a` is being printed. Otherwise, if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program prints the integer part of the product of `(2 * b - n + 1)` and `n` divided by 2. Otherwise, the program prints the sum of the arithmetic series with first term `a`, last term `b`, and `n` terms, calculated as the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms.***
