The code prints the result of a mathematical expression involving the variables `a`, `b`, and `n`. The expression calculates the sum of an arithmetic series with `n` terms, where the first term is `a` and the last term is `b`. The formula used is the sum of an arithmetic series: `n * (a + b) / 2`, but it's modified to `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. `(b - a) / 2` calculates the average of the difference between `b` and `a`. Since `b` and `a` are integers between 1 and 10^9, this expression will result in an integer value.
2. `(b - a + 1)` calculates the number of terms in the arithmetic series. This is because the series starts at `a` and ends at `b`, and there are `b - a + 1` terms in between.
3. The product of `(b - a) / 2` and `(b - a + 1)` gives the sum of the arithmetic series, but without considering the first term `a`.
4. `a * n` adds the contribution of the first term `a` to the sum, multiplied by the number of terms `n`.

The final result is the sum of the arithmetic series, which is an integer value.

Output: **the sum of the arithmetic series with n terms, where the first term is a and the last term is b**
