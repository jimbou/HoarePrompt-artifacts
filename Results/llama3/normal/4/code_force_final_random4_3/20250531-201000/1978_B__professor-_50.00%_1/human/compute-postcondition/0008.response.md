The code prints the result of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`, which is an integer value.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

* `2 * b`: This expression multiplies the value of `b` by 2. Since `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, the result will be an even integer between 2 and 2*10^9.
* `- n + 1`: This expression subtracts the value of `n` from the result of the previous step and then adds 1. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, the result will be an integer between 1 and 2*10^9 - n + 1.
* `* n`: This expression multiplies the result of the previous step by the value of `n`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, the result will be an integer between n and n*(2*10^9 - n + 1).
* `/ 2`: This expression divides the result of the previous step by 2. Since the result is an integer, the division will be exact, and the result will be an integer between n/2 and n*(2*10^9 - n + 1)/2.

The final result is an integer value that represents the result of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`.

Output: **an integer value representing the result of the expression (2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2**
