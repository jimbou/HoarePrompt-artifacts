The code prints the result of a mathematical expression involving the variables `a`, `b`, and `n`. The expression calculates the sum of an arithmetic series with `n` terms, where the first term is `a` and the common difference is `(b - a + 1) / 2`.

Since `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 and greater than `a`, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, the expression will evaluate to a specific integer value.

However, without knowing the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `n`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of the expression.

Output: **the sum of an arithmetic series with n terms, where the first term is a and the common difference is (b - a + 1) / 2 (where a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9 and greater than a, and n is an integer between 1 and 10^9)**
