The code prints the calculated value of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`, which is then converted to an integer using the `int()` function.

Based on the precondition, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. The expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2` calculates the sum of an arithmetic series with `n` terms, where the first term is `2 * b - n + 1` and the common difference is 1.

Since `n` and `b` are integers, the expression will evaluate to an integer value. The `int()` function will not change the value, as it is already an integer.

Therefore, the output will be the calculated value of the expression, which is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (since `n` and `b` are between 1 and 10^9).

Output: **an integer between 1 and 10^18**
