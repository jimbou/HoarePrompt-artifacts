Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9) â€” the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `t` is assigned a positive integer value from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` is the number of buns, `a` is the usual price of a bun, and `b` is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.
