Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. `b` is greater than `a`. The current value of `b` minus `a` is greater than or equal to `n`***
