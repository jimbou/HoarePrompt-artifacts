Output: ** `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: the sum of the arithmetic series with first term `a`, last term `b`, and `n` terms, calculated as the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms, which is equal to `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`**
