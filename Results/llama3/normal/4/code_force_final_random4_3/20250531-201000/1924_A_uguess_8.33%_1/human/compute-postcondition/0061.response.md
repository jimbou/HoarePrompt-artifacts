Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least 2 characters, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is 1, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0-indexed), and `stdin` contains the remaining test cases. If `cur` was equal to (1 << k) - 1, then `cnt` is 2 and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt` is 1 and no change is made to the variables.***
