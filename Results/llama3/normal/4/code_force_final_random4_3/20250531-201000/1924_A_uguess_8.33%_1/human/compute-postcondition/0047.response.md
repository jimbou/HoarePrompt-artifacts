Output State: **t is greater than 1, n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is 0, cur is 0, i is 1, and stdin contains the remaining test cases.**

The code block reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m` from the input and assigns them to the corresponding variables. It then reads a string `s` of length `m` from the input, which comprises only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The variables `cnt` and `cur` are initialized to 0. The value of `t` remains greater than 1, and `i` is set to 1. The stdin now contains the remaining test cases.
