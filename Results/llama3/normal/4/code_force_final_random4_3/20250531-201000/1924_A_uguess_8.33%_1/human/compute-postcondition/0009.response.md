Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m that must have at least 1 character, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, ss is the first character in the string, cnt is 1, i is 0, cur_ss is an integer between 0 and k-1, cur is 0, stdin contains the remaining test cases.**

In this final state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `cur` has been reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged, retaining their initial values and properties as specified in the precondition.
