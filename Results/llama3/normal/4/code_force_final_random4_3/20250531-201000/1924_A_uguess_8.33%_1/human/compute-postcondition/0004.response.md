Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length m that must have at least 1 character, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the first character in the string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `i` is 0, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and k-1, stdin contains the remaining test cases**

The code assigns the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')` to `cur_ss`. Since `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, which comprises only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')` will be an integer between 0 and k-1. The values of the other variables are not affected.
