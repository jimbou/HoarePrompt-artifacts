State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is greater than 1, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m`, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is the number of times the substring of length `k` with different characters appears in the string `s`, `cur` is 0 if the last substring of length `k` in the string `s` has different characters, otherwise `cur` is the bit mask of the last substring of length `k` in the string `s`, `i` is 2, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0-indexed), `tmp` is either an empty string or a string consisting of the character 'a' if the current value of `cur` has the bit `i` set to 1, otherwise `tmp` is a string consisting of the character 'b', and `ans` is a string consisting of `k-1` 'a's repeated `cnt` times, and `stdin` contains the remaining test cases.**
