Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `m` is a non-negative integer between 3 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least 3 characters, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is 1, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0-indexed), `cnt` is 1, `cur` is 0, and `stdin` contains the remaining test cases.**

The value of `cur_ss` is updated to the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0-indexed), which is calculated using the ASCII values of `ss` and 'a'. The ASCII value of 'a' is subtracted from the ASCII value of `ss` to get the position of `ss` in the alphabet. The other variables remain unchanged.
