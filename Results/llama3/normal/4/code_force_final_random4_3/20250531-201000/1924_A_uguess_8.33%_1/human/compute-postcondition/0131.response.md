Output State: **n, k are greater than or equal to 0, m, t is 0, s is a string of length m that must have at least m characters, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the position of the character ss in the alphabet (0-indexed), cnt is an integer between 0 and m, cur is either cur + (1 << cur_ss) or 0, tmp is either an empty string or a string consisting of a single character which is the k-th lowercase English alphabet, and ans is a string consisting of k-1 'a's repeated cnt times, followed by tmp, and then n - cnt - 1 'a's. If the current value of cur does not have the k-th bit set, i.e., cur & 1 << k equals 0, then tmp is a string consisting of a single character which is the k-th lowercase English alphabet.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the loop has iterated over all the lowercase English alphabets from 'a' to the k-th alphabet. The value of `i` is now equal to `k`, and the value of `tmp` is either an empty string or a string consisting of a single character which is the k-th lowercase English alphabet. The value of `ans` is a string consisting of `k-1` 'a's repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then `n - cnt - 1` 'a's. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
