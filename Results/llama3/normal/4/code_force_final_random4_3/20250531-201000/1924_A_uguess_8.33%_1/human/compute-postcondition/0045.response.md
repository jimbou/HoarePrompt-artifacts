Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. If the number of times a substring of length k with different characters appears in the string s is greater than or equal to n, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, and a string "ans" of length n, comprising only of the character 'a' plus k minus 1 is printed, and stdin contains the remaining test cases.***
