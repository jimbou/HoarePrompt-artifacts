Output State: **t is greater than 1, n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m that must have at least 2 characters, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is 2 if cur was equal to (1 << k) - 1 and the bit corresponding to the position of the second character ss in the alphabet is set in cur, otherwise cnt is 1, i is 1, ss is the second character in the string s, cur_ss is the position of the character ss in the alphabet (0-indexed), cur is 0, and stdin contains the remaining test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1 if the bit corresponding to the position of the second character `ss` in the alphabet is set in `cur`. Otherwise, the value of `cnt` remains unchanged. The value of `cur` has been reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
