Output: **`n`, `k`, `m`, `t`, `i` are integers, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least `m` characters, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0-indexed), `cnt` is an integer equal to or greater than `n`, `cur` is either `cur` + (1 << `cur_ss`) or 0, `tmp` is an empty string, and `ans` is a string consisting of `k`-1 'a's repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then `n` - `cnt` - 1 'a's. If `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, then `cnt` is `cnt` + 1, `cur` is 0, and `ans` is a string consisting of `k`-1 'a's repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then `n` - `cnt` - 1 'a's. Otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged, and `ans` remains a string consisting of `k`-1 'a's repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then `n` - `cnt` - 1 'a's. If `cur` & 1 << `cur_ss` == 0, then `cur` is either `cur` + (1 << `cur_ss`) or 0. If `cur` & 1 << `cur_ss` != 0, then `cur` remains unchanged, and 'YES' is printed**
