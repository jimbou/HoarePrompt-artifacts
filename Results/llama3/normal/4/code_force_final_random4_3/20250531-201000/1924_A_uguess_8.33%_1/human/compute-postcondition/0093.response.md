The only object in the loop head is variable `ss` and string `s`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If the string `s` has at least 1 character the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`. So for the loop to be executed  the string `s` must have at least 1 character and `ss` is the first character in the string `s`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least 1 character, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is `k` + 1, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0-indexed), `tmp` is an empty string, and `ans` is a string consisting of `k`-1 'a's repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then `n` - `cnt` - 1 'a's, `stdin` is empty**
