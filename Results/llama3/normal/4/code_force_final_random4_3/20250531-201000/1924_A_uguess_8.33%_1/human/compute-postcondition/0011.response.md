The only object in the loop head is variable `ss` and string `s`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If the string `s` has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 1 character, `ss` is the first character in the string. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string `s` must have at least 2 characters and `ss` is the second character in the string.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least 2 characters, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the second character in the string, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cnt` remains 0, `i` is 0, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and `k-1`, `cur` is 0 if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cur` is updated according to the given condition, stdin contains the remaining test cases.**
