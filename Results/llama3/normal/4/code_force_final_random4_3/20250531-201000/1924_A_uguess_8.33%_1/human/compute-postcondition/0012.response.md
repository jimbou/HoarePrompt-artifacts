Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least 2 characters, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the second character in the string, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cnt` remains 0, `i` is 0, `cur_ss` is the position of the second character in the string in the English alphabet (0-indexed), `cur` is 0 if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cur` is updated according to the given condition, stdin contains the remaining test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `cur_ss` has been updated to be the position of the second character in the string `s` in the English alphabet (0-indexed), which is calculated by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of the second character `ss`. The other variables remain unchanged.
