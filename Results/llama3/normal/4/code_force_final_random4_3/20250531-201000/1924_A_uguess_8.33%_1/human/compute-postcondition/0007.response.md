Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length m that must have at least 1 character, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the first character in the string, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and k-1, stdin contains the remaining test cases. If `cur` bitwise AND 1 left shifted by `cur_ss` bits is 0, then `cur` is updated to 1 plus the current value of `cur` left shifted by `cur_ss` bits.***
