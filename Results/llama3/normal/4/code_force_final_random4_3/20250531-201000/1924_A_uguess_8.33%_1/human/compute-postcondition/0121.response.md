The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the states of other variables do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`n`, `k` must be greater than 0, `m`, `t`, `i` is 0, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least `m` characters, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0-indexed), `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `m`, `cur` is either `cur` + (1 << `cur_ss`) or 0, `tmp` is an empty string, and `ans` is a string consisting of `k`-1 'a's repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then `n` - `cnt` - 1 'a's.**
