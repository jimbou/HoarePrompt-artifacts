Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 1, n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is the number of times the substring of length k with different characters appears in the string s, cur is 0 if the last substring of length k in the string s has different characters, otherwise cur is the bit mask of the last substring of length k in the string s, i is 1, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the position of the character ss in the alphabet (0-indexed), tmp is an empty string, ans is a string consisting of k-1 'a's repeated cnt times, and stdin contains the remaining test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is greater than 1, n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is greater than 0, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is the number of times the substring of length k with different characters appears in the string s, cur is 0 if the last substring of length k in the string s has different characters, otherwise cur is the bit mask of the last substring of length k in the string s, i is 0, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the position of the character ss in the alphabet (0-indexed), tmp is either an empty string or a string consisting of the character 'a' (because i is 0), and ans is a string consisting of k-1 'a's repeated cnt times, and stdin contains the remaining test cases. If the current value of cur does not have the bit i set to 1, then tmp is set to the string consisting of the character 'a'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is greater than 1, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m`, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is the number of times the substring of length `k` with different characters appears in the string `s`, `cur` is 0 if the last substring of length `k` in the string `s` has different characters, otherwise `cur` is the bit mask of the last substring of length `k` in the string `s`, `i` is 1, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0-indexed), `tmp` is either an empty string or a string consisting of the character 'a' if the current value of `cur` has the bit `i` set to 1, otherwise `tmp` is a string consisting of the character 'b', and `ans` is a string consisting of `k-1` 'a's repeated `cnt` times, and `stdin` contains the remaining test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 1, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is greater than 1, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m`, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is the number of times the substring of length `k` with different characters appears in the string `s`, `cur` is 0 if the last substring of length `k` in the string `s` has different characters, otherwise `cur` is the bit mask of the last substring of length `k` in the string `s`, `i` is 2, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0-indexed), `tmp` is either a string consisting of the character 'c' if the current value of `cur` has the bit `i` set to 0, otherwise `tmp` is either an empty string or a string consisting of the character 'a' if the current value of `cur` has the bit `i` set to 1, otherwise `tmp` is a string consisting of the character 'b', and `ans` is a string consisting of `k-1` 'a's repeated `cnt` times, and `stdin` contains the remaining test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
