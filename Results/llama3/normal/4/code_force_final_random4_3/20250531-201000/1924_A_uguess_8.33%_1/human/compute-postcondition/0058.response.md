The code increments the value of `cur` by 1 shifted to the left by the value of `cur_ss`. Since `cur_ss` is the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0-indexed), it is a value between 0 and `k-1`. Therefore, `1 << cur_ss` is a power of 2 between 1 and 2^k-1.

The value of `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`, which is a non-negative integer between 1 and 2^k-1.

The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least 2 characters, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `i` is 1, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0-indexed), `cur` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 2^k-1, and `stdin` contains the remaining test cases.**
