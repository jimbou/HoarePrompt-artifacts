Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 1, n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is 0, cur is 0, i is 1, and stdin contains the remaining test cases.
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 1, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least 1 character, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `i` is 1, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0-indexed), and `stdin` contains the remaining test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least 2 characters, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is 1, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0-indexed), and `stdin` contains the remaining test cases. If `cur` was equal to (1 << k) - 1, then `cnt` is 2 and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt` is 1 and no change is made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `m` is a non-negative integer between 3 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least 3 characters, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is 1, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0-indexed), and `stdin` contains the remaining test cases. If `cur` is equal to 2 to the power of `k` minus 1, then `cnt` is 2 and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cur` is set to 2 to the power of `cur_ss` if it was not already set to the bit corresponding to `cur_ss`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
