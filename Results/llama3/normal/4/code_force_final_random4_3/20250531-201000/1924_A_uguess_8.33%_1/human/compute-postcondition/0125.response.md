The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `k`, `k` is greater than 0. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again k must be greater than i.
State: **`n`, `k` are greater than i, `m`, `t` is 0, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least `m` characters, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0-indexed), `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `m`, `cur` is either `cur` + (1 << `cur_ss`) or 0, `tmp` is either an empty string or a string consisting of a single character which is the `i-th` lowercase English alphabet, and `ans` is a string consisting of `k`-1 'a's repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then `n` - `cnt` - 1 'a's. If the current value of `cur` does not have the `i-th` bit set, i.e., `cur` & 1 << `i` equals 0, then `tmp` is a string consisting of a single character which is the `i-th` lowercase English alphabet.**
