Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least 2 characters, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the second character in the string, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cnt` remains 0, `i` is 0, `cur_ss` is the position of the second character in the string in the English alphabet (0-indexed), `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`, stdin contains the remaining test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` is updated by adding `1` shifted to the left by `cur_ss` places. This means that the `cur_ss`-th bit of `cur` is set to `1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
