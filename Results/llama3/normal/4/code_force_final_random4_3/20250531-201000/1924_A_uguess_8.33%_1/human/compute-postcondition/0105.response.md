Output State: **n, k, m, t, i are integers, s is a string of length m that must have at least 2 characters, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, ss is the second character in the string s, cur_ss is the position of the character ss in the alphabet (0-indexed), cnt is 1, cur is 0, tmp is an empty string, and ans is a string consisting of k-1 'a's repeated cnt times, followed by tmp, and then n - cnt - 1 'a's.**

In this output state, the value of cnt has been incremented by 1, making it 1. The value of cur has been reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties as specified in the precondition.
