Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0, n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is 0, cur is 0, i is 0, stdin contains the remaining test cases.
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least 1 character, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the first character in the string, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cnt` remains 0, `i` is 0, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and `k-1`, `cur` is 0 if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cur` is updated according to the given condition, stdin contains the remaining test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least 2 characters, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the second character in the string, `cur_ss` is the position of the second character in the string in the English alphabet (0-indexed). If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 2, `cur` is 0, and `i` is 0. Otherwise, `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)` if the bit corresponding to the position of the second character in the string is not set in `cur`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is greater than 0, n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m that must have at least 3 characters, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, ss is the third character in the string, cur_ss is the position of the third character in the string in the English alphabet (0-indexed), which is equal to ord(ss) - ord('a'). If the bit corresponding to the position of the third character in the string is not set in cur, then cur is updated to cur + (1 << cur_ss). If cur equals (1 << k) - 1, then cnt is 2, cur is 0, and i is 0. Otherwise, cnt is 1 plus its original value, cur is 0, and i is unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
