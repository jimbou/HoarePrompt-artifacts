The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is greater than 1, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m`, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is the number of times the substring of length `k` with different characters appears in the string `s`, `cur` is 0 if the last substring of length `k` in the string `s` has different characters, otherwise `cur` is the bit mask of the last substring of length `k` in the string `s`, `i` is 1, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0-indexed), `tmp` is either an empty string or a string consisting of the character 'a' (because `i` is 1), and `ans` is a string consisting of `k-1` 'a's repeated `cnt` times, and `stdin` contains the remaining test cases. If the current value of `cur` does not have the bit `i` set to 1, then `tmp` is set to the string consisting of the character 'a'.**
