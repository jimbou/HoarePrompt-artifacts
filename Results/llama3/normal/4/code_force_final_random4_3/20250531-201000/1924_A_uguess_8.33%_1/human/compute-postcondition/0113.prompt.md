Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is 0, cur is 0, t is greater than 2, i is k + 1, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the position of the character ss in the alphabet (0-indexed), tmp is an empty string, and ans is a string consisting of k-1 'a's repeated cnt times, followed by tmp, and then n - cnt - 1 'a's, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `k`, `m`, `t`, `i` are integers, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least 1 character, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0-indexed), `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `cur` is either 0 or 1 shifted to the left by `cur_ss` places, `tmp` is an empty string, and `ans` is a string consisting of `k`-1 'a's repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then `n` - `cnt` - 1 'a's. If `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, then `cnt` is 1, `cur` is 0, and `ans` is a string consisting of `k`-1 'a's repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then `n` - `cnt` - 1 'a's. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, and `ans` remains a string consisting of `k`-1 'a's repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then `n` - `cnt` - 1 'a's.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `k`, `m`, `t`, `i` are integers, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least 2 characters, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0-indexed), `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `cur` is either `cur` + (1 << `cur_ss`) or 0, `tmp` is an empty string, and `ans` is a string consisting of `k`-1 'a's repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then `n` - `cnt` - 1 'a's. If `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, then `cnt` is 1, `cur` is 0, and `ans` is a string consisting of `k`-1 'a's repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then `n` - `cnt` - 1 'a's. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, and `ans` remains a string consisting of `k`-1 'a's repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then `n` - `cnt` - 1 'a's. If `cur` & 1 << `cur_ss` == 0, then `cur` is either `cur` + (1 << `cur_ss`) or 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `k`, `m`, `t`, `i` are integers, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least 3 characters, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0-indexed) and is equal to `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `cur` is either `cur` + (1 << `cur_ss`) or 0, `tmp` is an empty string, and `ans` is a string consisting of `k`-1 'a's repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then `n` - `cnt` - 1 'a's. If `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, then `cnt` is 1, `cur` is 0, and `ans` is a string consisting of `k`-1 'a's repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then `n` - `cnt` - 1 'a's. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, and `ans` remains a string consisting of `k`-1 'a's repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then `n` - `cnt` - 1 'a's. If `cur` & 1 << `cur_ss` == 0, then `cur` is either `cur` + (1 << `cur_ss`) or 0. If `cur` & 1 << `cur_ss` != 0, then `cur` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
