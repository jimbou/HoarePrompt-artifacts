The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is unknown, `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `k` must be greater than `i`. 
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is greater than 1, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m`, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is the number of times a substring of length `k` with different characters appears in the string `s`, if the bit at position `i` of `cur` is 0, then `tmp` is 'a', `ans` is a string of length `cnt`, comprising only of the character 'a' plus `k` minus 1, and 'NO' is printed, stdin contains the remaining test cases, `i` is 1**
