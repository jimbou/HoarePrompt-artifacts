Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `m`, `t`, `i` are integers, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least 1 character, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0-indexed), `cnt` is 0, `cur` is either 0 or 1 shifted to the left by `cur_ss` places, `tmp` is an empty string, and `ans` is a string consisting of `k`-1 'a's repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then `n` - `cnt` - 1 'a's. If `cur` and `1` shifted to the left by `cur_ss` places have no bits in common, then `cur` is 1 shifted to the left by `cur_ss` places. Otherwise, `cur` is 0.***
