Output State: **`n`, `k`, `m`, `t`, `i` are integers, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least 2 characters, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0-indexed), `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `cur` is either `cur` + (1 << `cur_ss`) or 0, `tmp` is an empty string, and `ans` is a string consisting of `k`-1 'a's repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then `n` - `cnt` - 1 'a's. If `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, then `cnt` is 1, `cur` is 0, and `ans` is a string consisting of `k`-1 'a's repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then `n` - `cnt` - 1 'a's. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, and `ans` remains a string consisting of `k`-1 'a's repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then `n` - `cnt` - 1 'a's.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been updated by adding (1 << `cur_ss`) to its previous value. If the new value of `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, then `cnt` is set to 1 and `cur` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
