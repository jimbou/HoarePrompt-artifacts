Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a non-negative integer, `n`, `k`, and `m` are non-negative integers and 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26 and 1 <= m <= 1000, stdin contains the remaining test cases, including the second line of the first test case, which is a string s of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    cur = 0
    for ss in s:
        cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
        if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
            cur += 1 << cur_ss
        if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
            cnt += 1
            cur = 0
    if cnt >= n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        tmp = ''
        ans = chr(ord('a') + k - 1) * cnt
        for i in range(k):
            if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
        ans += tmp
        ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is greater than 0, n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. If the number of times a substring of length k with different characters appears in the string s is greater than or equal to n, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, and a string "ans" of length n, comprising only of the character 'a' plus k minus 1 is printed, and stdin contains the remaining test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is greater than 1, n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is the number of times the substring of length k with different characters appears in the string s. If cnt is greater than or equal to n, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, i is k, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the position of the character ss in the alphabet (0-indexed), tmp is either an empty string or a string consisting of the character corresponding to the last value of i in the loop, and ans is a string consisting of k-1 'a's repeated cnt times, followed by tmp, and then n - cnt - 1 'a's, and ans is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The program prints a string consisting of `k-1` 'a's repeated `cnt` times, followed by an empty string, and then `n - cnt` 'a's if `cnt` is less than `n`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints 'YES' and the string `ans` remains unchanged, consisting of `k-1` 'a's repeated `cnt` times, followed by an empty string, and then `n - cnt - 1` 'a's.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
