Output: **t is greater than 1, n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is the number of times the substring of length k with different characters appears in the string s, cur is 0 if the last substring of length k in the string s has different characters, otherwise cur is the bit mask of the last substring of length k in the string s, i is k, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the position of the character ss in the alphabet (0-indexed), tmp is either an empty string or a string consisting of the character corresponding to the last value of i in the loop, and ans is a string consisting of k-1 'a's repeated cnt times, followed by tmp, and then n - cnt - 1 'a's, and stdin contains the remaining test cases, and ans is printed**
