Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0, n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is the number of times a substring of length k with different characters appears in the string s, cur is 0, i is 0, stdin contains the remaining test cases, tmp is an empty string, ans is a string of length cnt, comprising only of the character 'a' plus k minus 1, and 'NO' is printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is greater than 0, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m`, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is the number of times a substring of length `k` with different characters appears in the string `s`, if the bit at position `i` of `cur` is 0, then `tmp` is 'a', `ans` is a string of length `cnt`, comprising only of the character 'a' plus `k` minus 1, and 'NO' is printed, stdin contains the remaining test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is greater than 1, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m`, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is the number of times a substring of length `k` with different characters appears in the string `s`, `i` is 1, and `ans` is a string of length `cnt`, comprising only of the character 'a' plus `k` minus 1. If the bit at position `i` of `cur` is 0, then `tmp` is 'b', otherwise `tmp` is 'a'. 'NO' is printed, and stdin contains the remaining test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is greater than 2, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m`, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is the number of times a substring of length `k` with different characters appears in the string `s`, `i` is 2, `ans` is a string of length `cnt`, comprising only of the character 'a' plus `k` minus 1. If the bit at position `i` of `cur` is 0, then `tmp` is 'c', 'NO' is printed, and stdin contains the remaining test cases. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
