Output State: **t is greater than 1, n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is the number of times the substring of length k with different characters appears in the string s, cur is 0 if the last substring of length k in the string s has different characters, otherwise cur is the bit mask of the last substring of length k in the string s, i is 1, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the position of the character ss in the alphabet (0-indexed), and stdin contains the remaining test cases.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all characters in the string s. The variable cnt now holds the total count of substrings of length k with different characters in the string s. The variable cur is reset to 0 if the last substring of length k in the string s has different characters, otherwise it holds the bit mask of the last substring of length k in the string s. The variable ss holds the last character in the string s, and cur_ss holds its position in the alphabet. The other variables remain unchanged.
