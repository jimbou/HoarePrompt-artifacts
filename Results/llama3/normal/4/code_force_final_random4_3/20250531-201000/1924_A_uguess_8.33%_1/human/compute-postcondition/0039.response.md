Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is greater than 2, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m`, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is the number of times a substring of length `k` with different characters appears in the string `s`, `i` is 2, `ans` is a string of length `cnt`, comprising only of the character 'a' plus `k` minus 1, `tmp` is 'c', and 'NO' is printed, and stdin contains the remaining test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been updated to 'c' because `i` is 2 and `ord('a') + i` equals the ASCII value of 'c'. The other variables remain unchanged.
