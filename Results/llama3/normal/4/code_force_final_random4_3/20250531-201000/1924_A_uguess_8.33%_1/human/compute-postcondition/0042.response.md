Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is the number of times a substring of length k with different characters appears in the string s, i is equal to k, ans is a string of length n, comprising only of the character 'a' plus k minus 1, and 'NO' is printed, stdin contains the remaining test cases.**

The code modifies the value of `ans` by appending `tmp` to it and then adding `n - cnt - 1` occurrences of the character 'a'. The length of `ans` becomes `n`, and it now comprises only of the character 'a' plus `k` minus 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `i`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged.
