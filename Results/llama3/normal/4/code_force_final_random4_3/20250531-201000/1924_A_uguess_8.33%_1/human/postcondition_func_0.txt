The function determines if a given string contains a specified number of substrings with distinct characters of a certain length. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and generates a string of a specified length, consisting of a specific character repeated a certain number of times, followed by another character, and then the first character repeated again to fill the remaining length.
