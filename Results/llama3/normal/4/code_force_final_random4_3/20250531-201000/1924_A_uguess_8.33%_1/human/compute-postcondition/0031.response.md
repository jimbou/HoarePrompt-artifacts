According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is greater than 0, n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is the number of times a substring of length k with different characters appears in the string s, cur is 0, i is 0, stdin contains the remaining test cases, tmp is an empty string, ans is a string of length cnt, comprising only of the character 'a' plus k minus 1, and 'NO' is printed does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **t is greater than 0, n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is greater than 0, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is the number of times a substring of length k with different characters appears in the string s, cur is 0, i is 0, stdin contains the remaining test cases, tmp is an empty string, ans is a string of length cnt, comprising only of the character 'a' plus k minus 1, and 'NO' is printed**
