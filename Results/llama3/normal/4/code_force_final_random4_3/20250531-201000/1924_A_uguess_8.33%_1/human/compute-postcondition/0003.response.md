The only variable in the loop head is variable  ss and s, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string s. If the string s has at least 1 character the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than 0, n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, cnt is 0, cur is 0, i is 0, stdin contains the remaining test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the string s must have at least 1 character and the ss is the first character in the string.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length m that must have at least 1 character, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the first character in the string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains the remaining test cases**
