Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is greater than 1, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m`, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is the number of times a substring of length `k` with different characters appears in the string `s`, `tmp` is 'b', `ans` is a string of length `cnt`, comprising only of the character 'a' plus `k` minus 1, 'NO' is printed, stdin contains the remaining test cases, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been updated to 'b' because `i` is 1 and `chr(ord('a') + i)` returns the character 'b'. The other variables remain unchanged.
