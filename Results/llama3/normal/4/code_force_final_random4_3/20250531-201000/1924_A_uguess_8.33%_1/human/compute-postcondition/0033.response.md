Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is greater than 0, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m`, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is the number of times a substring of length `k` with different characters appears in the string `s`, `cur` is a value such that the bit at position `i` is 0, `i` is 0, `tmp` is 'a', `ans` is a string of length `cnt`, comprising only of the character 'a' plus `k` minus 1, and 'NO' is printed, stdin contains the remaining test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been updated to 'a' because `i` is 0 and `chr(ord('a') + i)` returns the character 'a' when `i` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
