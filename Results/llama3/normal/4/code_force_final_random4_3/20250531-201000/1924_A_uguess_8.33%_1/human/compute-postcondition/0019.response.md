Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least 3 characters, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the third character in the string, `cur_ss` is the position of the third character in the string in the English alphabet (0-indexed), which is equal to `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cur` is `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`, `cnt` is 2 if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, and `i` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `cur` has been updated by adding the value of `(1 << cur_ss)` to it. This means that the bit corresponding to the position of the third character in the string has been set in `cur`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
