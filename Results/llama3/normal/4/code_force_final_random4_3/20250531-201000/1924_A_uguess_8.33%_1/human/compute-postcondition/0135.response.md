Postcondition: **The program prints a string consisting of `k-1` 'a's repeated `cnt` times, followed by an empty string, and then `n - cnt` 'a's if `cnt` is less than `n`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints 'YES' and the string `ans` remains unchanged, consisting of `k-1` 'a's repeated `cnt` times, followed by an empty string, and then `n - cnt - 1` 'a's.**
