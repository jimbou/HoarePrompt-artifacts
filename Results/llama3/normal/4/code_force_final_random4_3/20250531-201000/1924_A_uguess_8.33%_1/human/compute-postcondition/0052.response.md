Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least 1 character, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 1, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0-indexed), and `stdin` contains the remaining test cases. If the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is 0, then `cur` is updated to `cur + 1 << cur_ss`, setting the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` to 1.***
