Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m`, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is the number of times a substring of length `k` with different characters appears in the string `s`, `i` is equal to `k`, `ans` is a string of length `cnt`, comprising only of the character 'a' plus `k` minus 1, and 'NO' is printed, stdin contains the remaining test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that all variables not affected by the loop head and body remain unchanged. The loop counter `i` is equal to `k`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The string `tmp` is assigned the character corresponding to the last iteration of the loop, which is the character at position `k-1` in the alphabet (since indexing starts at 0). The rest of the variables maintain their initial values.
