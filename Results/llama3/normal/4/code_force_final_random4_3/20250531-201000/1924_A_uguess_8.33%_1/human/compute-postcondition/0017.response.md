To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for ss in s:`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `s` is a string of length `m` with at least 2 characters, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. `ss` is the second character in the string.

For the loop to execute again, we need to consider the next character in the string `s`. Since `ss` is the second character, the next character would be the third character in the string.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least 3 characters, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the third character in the string, `cur_ss` is the position of the third character in the string in the English alphabet (0-indexed). If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 2, `cur` is 0, and `i` is 0. Otherwise, `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)` if the bit corresponding to the position of the third character in the string is not set in `cur`.**
