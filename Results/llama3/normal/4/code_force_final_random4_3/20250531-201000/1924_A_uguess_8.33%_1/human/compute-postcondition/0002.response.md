Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is 0, cur is 0, i is 0, stdin contains the remaining test cases.**

The first line of the code assigns the values of n, k, and m from the input to the corresponding variables. The second line assigns the string s from the input to the variable s. The third and fourth lines initialize the variables cnt and cur to 0, respectively. The variable i remains unchanged at 0. The values of t and stdin are not affected by the code.
