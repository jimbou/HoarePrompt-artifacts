To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ss` and `s`.

According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`. For the loop to execute again, `ss` should be the next character in the string `s`.

Since `s` has at least 1 character, we can conclude that `s` has at least 2 characters for the loop to execute again. Therefore, `ss` should be the second character in the string `s`.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least 2 characters, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `i` is 1, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0-indexed), and `stdin` contains the remaining test cases.**
