Output State: **The program prints 'YES' if the number of times a substring of length k with different characters appears in the string s is greater than or equal to n, otherwise it prints 'NO' and a string "ans" of length n, comprising only of the character 'a' plus k minus 1.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the program will print 'YES' if the number of times a substring of length k with different characters appears in the string s is greater than or equal to n, otherwise it will print 'NO' and a string "ans" of length n, comprising only of the character 'a' plus k minus 1.
