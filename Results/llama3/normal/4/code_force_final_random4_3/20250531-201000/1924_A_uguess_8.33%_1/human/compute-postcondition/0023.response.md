Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is the number of times a substring of length k with different characters appears in the string s, cur is 0, i is 0, stdin contains the remaining test cases.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of t, n, k, and m remain unchanged. The string s has been fully processed, and the variable cnt now holds the count of substrings of length k with different characters that appear in the string s. The variable cur has been reset to 0, indicating that all characters in the string have been processed. The variable i remains unchanged, and the stdin still contains the remaining test cases.
