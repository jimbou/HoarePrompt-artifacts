Output State: **t is greater than 1, n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is the number of times the substring of length k with different characters appears in the string s, cur is 0 if the last substring of length k in the string s has different characters, otherwise cur is the bit mask of the last substring of length k in the string s, i is 1, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the position of the character ss in the alphabet (0-indexed), tmp is an empty string, ans is a string consisting of k-1 'a's repeated cnt times, and stdin contains the remaining test cases.**

The code snippet does not modify the values of t, n, k, m, s, cnt, cur, i, ss, or cur_ss. It only introduces two new variables: tmp, which is assigned an empty string, and ans, which is assigned a string consisting of k-1 'a's repeated cnt times. The remaining test cases in stdin are not affected by the code.
