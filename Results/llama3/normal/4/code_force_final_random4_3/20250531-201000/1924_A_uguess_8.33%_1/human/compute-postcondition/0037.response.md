Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is greater than 1, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m`, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is the number of times a substring of length `k` with different characters appears in the string `s`, `i` is 1, and `ans` is a string of length `cnt`, comprising only of the character 'a' plus `k` minus 1. If the bit at position `i` of `cur` is 0, then `tmp` is 'b', otherwise `tmp` is 'a'. 'NO' is printed, and stdin contains the remaining test cases.***
