Postcondition: **`n`, `k` are greater than 0, `m`, `t`, `i` is 0, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least `m` characters, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0-indexed), `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `m`, `cur` is either `cur` + (1 << `cur_ss`) or 0, `tmp` is an empty string, and `ans` is a string consisting of `k`-1 'a's repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then `n` - `cnt` - 1 'a's. The current value of `cur` does not have the `i-th` bit set, i.e., `cur` & 1 << `i` equals 0.**
