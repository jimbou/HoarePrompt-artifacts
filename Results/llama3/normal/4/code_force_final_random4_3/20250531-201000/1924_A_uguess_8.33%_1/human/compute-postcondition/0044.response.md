The code prints the string `ans` which is a string of length `n`, comprising only of the character 'a' plus `k` minus 1.
Output: **t is greater than 0, n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is the number of times a substring of length k with different characters appears in the string s, i is equal to k, ans is a string of length n, comprising only of the character 'a' plus k minus 1, and 'NO' is printed, stdin contains the remaining test cases, and the string "ans" is printed which is a string of length n, comprising only of the character 'a' plus k minus 1**
