Output State: **n, k are greater than or equal to 0, m, t is 0, s is a string of length m that must have at least m characters, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the position of the character ss in the alphabet (0-indexed), cnt is an integer between 0 and m, cur is either cur + (1 << cur_ss) or 0, tmp is an empty string, and ans is a string consisting of k-1 'a's repeated cnt times, followed by tmp, and then n - cnt 'a's.**

The code appends the string tmp to ans, and then appends n - cnt - 1 'a's to ans. Since tmp is either an empty string or a string consisting of a single character which is the k-th lowercase English alphabet, and the current value of cur does not have the k-th bit set, tmp is a string consisting of a single character which is the k-th lowercase English alphabet. Therefore, ans becomes a string consisting of k-1 'a's repeated cnt times, followed by the k-th lowercase English alphabet, and then n - cnt 'a's.
