Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is the number of times a substring of length k with different characters appears in the string s, cur is 0, i is 0, stdin contains the remaining test cases, tmp is an empty string, ans is a string of length cnt, comprising only of the character 'a' plus k minus 1, and 'NO' is printed.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns an empty string to the variable `tmp`. The second line assigns a string of length `cnt` to the variable `ans`, where each character is the result of adding `k-1` to the ASCII value of 'a' and converting it back to a character using the `chr` function. This means that `ans` will be a string of length `cnt`, comprising only of the character 'a' plus `k-1`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
