Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n, k, m, t, i are integers, s is a string of length m that must have at least m characters, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the position of the character ss in the alphabet (0-indexed), cnt is an integer between 0 and m, cur is either cur + (1 << cur_ss) or 0, tmp is an empty string, and ans is a string consisting of k-1 'a's repeated cnt times, followed by tmp, and then n - cnt - 1 'a's.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `k` are greater than 0, `m`, `t` is 0, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least `m` characters, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0-indexed), `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `m`, `cur` is either `cur` + (1 << `cur_ss`) or 0, `tmp` is either an empty string or a string consisting of a single character which is the `i-th` lowercase English alphabet, and `ans` is a string consisting of `k`-1 'a's repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then `n` - `cnt` - 1 'a's. If the current value of `cur` does not have the `i-th` bit set, i.e., `cur` & 1 << `i` equals 0, then `tmp` is a string consisting of a single character which is the `i-th` lowercase English alphabet.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `k` are greater than `i`, `m`, `t` is 0, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least `m` characters, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0-indexed), `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `m`, `cur` is either `cur` + (1 << `cur_ss`) or 0, `tmp` is either an empty string or a string consisting of a single character which is the `i-th` lowercase English alphabet, and `ans` is a string consisting of `k`-1 'a's repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then `n` - `cnt` - 1 'a's. If the current value of `cur` does not have the `i-th` bit set, i.e., `cur` & 1 << `i` equals 0, then `tmp` is a string consisting of a single character which is the `i-th` lowercase English alphabet.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `k` are greater than `i+1`, `m`, `t` is 0, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least `m` characters, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0-indexed), `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `m`, `cur` is either `cur` + (1 << `cur_ss`) or 0, `tmp` is either an empty string or a string consisting of a single character which is the `(i+1)-th` lowercase English alphabet, and `ans` is a string consisting of `k`-1 'a's repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then `n` - `cnt` - 1 'a's. If the current value of `cur` does not have the `(i+1)-th` bit set, i.e., `cur` & 1 << `(i+1)` equals 0, then `tmp` is a string consisting of a single character which is the `(i+1)-th` lowercase English alphabet, and `i` is `i+1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
