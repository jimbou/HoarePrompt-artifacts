The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a non-negative integer does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0. 
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `k`, and `m` are non-negative integers and 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26 and 1 <= m <= 1000, stdin contains the remaining test cases, including the second line of the first test case, which is a string s of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `i` is 0**
