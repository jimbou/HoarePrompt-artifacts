The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state contains multiple test cases, the first line of the first test case is read, which contains three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`. However, only the first integer `n` is read and assigned to `t` because `int(input())` only reads the first integer from the input.

The values of `n`, `k`, and `m` are not affected, and the second line of the first test case, which contains the string `s`, is still in the input buffer. The remaining test cases are also still in the input buffer.

Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `n`, `k`, and `m` are non-negative integers and 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26 and 1 <= m <= 1000, stdin contains the remaining test cases, including the second line of the first test case, which is a string s of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.**
