Postcondition: ***`n`, `k` are greater than `i+1`, `m`, `t` is 0, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least `m` characters, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0-indexed), `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `m`, `cur` is either `cur` + (1 << `cur_ss`) or 0, `tmp` is either an empty string or a string consisting of a single character which is the `(i+1)-th` lowercase English alphabet, and `ans` is a string consisting of `k`-1 'a's repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then `n` - `cnt` - 1 'a's. If the current value of `cur` does not have the `(i+1)-th` bit set, i.e., `cur` & 1 << `(i+1)` equals 0, then `tmp` is a string consisting of a single character which is the `(i+1)-th` lowercase English alphabet, and `i` is `i+1`.***
