The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not specified, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m`, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If the number of times a substring of length `k` with different characters appears in the string `s` is greater than or equal to `n`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, and a string "ans" of length `n`, comprising only of the character 'a' plus `k` minus 1 is printed, and `i` is 1, and stdin contains the remaining test cases.**
