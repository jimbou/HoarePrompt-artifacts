The code prints a string consisting of k-1 'a's repeated cnt times, followed by tmp, and then n - cnt - 1 'a's. Here, cnt is the number of times the substring of length k with different characters appears in the string s, tmp is either an empty string or a string consisting of the character corresponding to the last value of i in the loop, and n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26.

Output: **a string consisting of k-1 'a's repeated cnt times, followed by tmp, and then n - cnt - 1 'a's (where cnt is the number of times the substring of length k with different characters appears in the string s, tmp is either an empty string or a string consisting of the character corresponding to the last value of i in the loop, and n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26)**
