Based on the precondition, the code will print a string 'YES' regardless of the values of the variables `n`, `k`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, `cnt`, `cur`, `tmp`, and `ans`. The print statement is not dependent on any of these variables, so the output will always be the same.

Output: **YES**
