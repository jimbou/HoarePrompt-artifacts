Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least 2 characters, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `i` is 1, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0-indexed), and `stdin` contains the remaining test cases.**

The value of `cur_ss` is updated to be the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0-indexed), which is calculated by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of `ss`. The other variables remain unchanged.
