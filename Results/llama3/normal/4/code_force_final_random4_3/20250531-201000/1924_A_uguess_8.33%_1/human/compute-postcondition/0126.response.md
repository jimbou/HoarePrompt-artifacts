Output State: **`n`, `k` are greater than `i`, `m`, `t` is 0, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least `m` characters, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0-indexed), `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `m`, `cur` is either `cur` + (1 << `cur_ss`) or 0, `tmp` is a string consisting of a single character which is the `i-th` lowercase English alphabet, and `ans` is a string consisting of `k`-1 'a's repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then `n` - `cnt` - 1 'a's.**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been updated to a string consisting of a single character which is the `i-th` lowercase English alphabet, as determined by the expression `chr(ord('a') + i)`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
