Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least 2 characters, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the second character in the string, `cur_ss` is the position of the second character in the string in the English alphabet (0-indexed). If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 2, `cur` is 0, and `i` is 0. Otherwise, `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)` if the bit corresponding to the position of the second character in the string is not set in `cur`.***
