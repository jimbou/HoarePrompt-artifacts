Output State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, and stdin contains 1 input: t space-separated integers.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, from 1 to 2. The values of the other variables, `x`, `subseq_lens`, and `mx`, remain unchanged. The stdin still contains 1 input: t space-separated integers, as it was not affected by the code.
