Output State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the lengths of the subsequences of consecutive powers of 2 that sum up to the original value of `x`, `mx` is the maximum length of these subsequences, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1`, and stdin contains 1 input: t space-separated integers.**

In this output state, the value of `x` remains 0, and the list `subseq_lens` and the maximum length `mx` are still valid as they were not modified by the code. The new variable `ansv` is introduced, which is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1`, generated using a list comprehension. The stdin still contains 1 input: t space-separated integers, as it was not affected by the code.
