The code prints the element at index `i` of the list `ansv`, which is the second element of the list `ansv` since `i` is 1. The list `ansv` contains integers from 0 to `mx-1` plus all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one.

Since `mx` is the maximum length of the subsequences in `subseq_lens`, the list `ansv` will have elements from 0 to `mx-1` followed by all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one.

Therefore, the second element of `ansv` (at index 1) will be 1, which is the second integer from the range 0 to `mx-1`.

Output: **1**
