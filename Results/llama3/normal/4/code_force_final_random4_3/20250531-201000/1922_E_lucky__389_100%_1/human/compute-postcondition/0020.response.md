Output State: **x is an integer between 1 and 1000, x is not equal to 2, i is the smallest integer such that 2 to the power of i is greater than x, subseq_lens is a list containing i - 1, mx is the maximum of 0 and i - 1, and stdin contains 1 input: t space-separated integers.**

In this output state, the value of x has been reduced by 2 to the power of i - 1, where i is the smallest integer such that 2 to the power of i is greater than x. The list subseq_lens now contains the value i - 1, which is the length of a subsequence. The variable mx has been updated to be the maximum of its original value (0) and i - 1. The value of i remains the smallest integer such that 2 to the power of i is greater than x, and stdin still contains 1 input: t space-separated integers.
