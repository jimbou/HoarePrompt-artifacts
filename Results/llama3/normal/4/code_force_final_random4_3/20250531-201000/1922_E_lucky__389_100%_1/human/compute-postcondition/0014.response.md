According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `i`. If 2 to the power of `i` is less than or equal to `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is an integer between 4 and 1000, `i` is 2. `x` being an integer between 4 and 1000 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `x` is greater than or equal to 2 to the power of 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 2 to the power of 3, `i` is 2, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, stdin contains 1 input: t space-separated integers.**
