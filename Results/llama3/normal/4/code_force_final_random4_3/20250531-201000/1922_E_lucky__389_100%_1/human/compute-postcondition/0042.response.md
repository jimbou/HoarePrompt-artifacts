According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If 2 to the power of `i` is less than or equal to `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `x` is greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute one more time, 2 to the power of `i` must be less than or equal to `x`. Since `i` is 3, 2 to the power of `i` is 8. Therefore, `x` must be greater than or equal to 8.

State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 8, `i` is 3**
