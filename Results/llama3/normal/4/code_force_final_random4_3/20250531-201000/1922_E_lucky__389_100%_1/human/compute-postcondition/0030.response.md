Output State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 2 ** (i - 1), `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(x) + 1, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, and stdin contains 1 input: t space-separated integers.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `x` is greater than or equal to 2 raised to the power of `i - 1`, `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base 2 logarithm of `x` plus 1, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, and stdin contains 1 input: t space-separated integers.
