Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `x` is not equal to 2, `i` is the smallest integer such that 2 to the power of `i` is greater than `x`, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, stdin contains 1 input: t space-separated integers.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `x` remains an integer between 1 and 1000, not equal to 2, and `i` becomes the smallest integer such that 2 to the power of `i` is greater than `x`. The other variables, `subseq_lens` and `mx`, remain unchanged as an empty list and 0, respectively. The input in stdin also remains the same, containing 1 input of t space-separated integers.
