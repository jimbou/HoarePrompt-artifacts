Output State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(x) + 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `subseq_lens` contains the value `i - 1`, and `mx` is the maximum value between its original value and `i - 1`.**

In this final state, the value of `x` has been reduced by `2 ** (i - 1)`, which is a power of 2. The value of `i` remains the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(x) + 1`, but its value may have changed due to the reduction in `x`. The list `subseq_lens` now contains the value `i - 1`, which is the length of a subsequence. The value of `mx` has been updated to be the maximum of its original value and `i - 1`, which represents the maximum length of a subsequence found so far.
