Output State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `mx` is the maximum length of these subsequences, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` plus the second and third element of `subseq_lens`, `i` is 2, and stdin contains 1 input: t space-separated integers.**

In this output state, the value of `ansv` has been updated to include the third element of `subseq_lens` (since `i` is 2), in addition to the integers from 0 to `mx-1` and the second element of `subseq_lens`. The other variables remain unchanged.
