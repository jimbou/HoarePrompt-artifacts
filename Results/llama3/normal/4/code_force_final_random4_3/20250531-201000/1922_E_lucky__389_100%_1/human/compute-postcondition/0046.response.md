Output State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `x` remains greater than or equal to 2, and the value of `i` remains 0. The code `break` causes the program to exit the innermost loop or if statement it is currently inside, but does not change the values of any variables.
