The variable in the loop head is variable i and x, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables i and x.  If 2 to the power of i is less than or equal to x, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 1 and x is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, x must be greater than or equal to 4.
State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 1, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, and stdin contains 1 input: t space-separated integers.**
