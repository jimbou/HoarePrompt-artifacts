The code prints the length of the list `ansv`. 
The list `ansv` contains integers from 0 to `mx-1` plus all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one. 
Since `mx` is the maximum length of the subsequences in `subseq_lens`, `mx` is equal to the maximum value in `subseq_lens`. 
The list `subseq_lens` has at least `len(subseq_lens)` elements. 
Therefore, the length of `ansv` is equal to the sum of `mx` and `len(subseq_lens)-1`. 
Since `mx` is the maximum value in `subseq_lens`, `mx` is less than or equal to `len(subseq_lens)`. 
Therefore, the length of `ansv` is less than or equal to the sum of `len(subseq_lens)` and `len(subseq_lens)-1`. 
This sum is equal to 2 times `len(subseq_lens)` minus 1. 
Since `i` is `len(subseq_lens)-1`, the length of `ansv` is equal to 2 times `i` plus 1.
Output: **2 times i plus 1 (where i is len(subseq_lens)-1)**
