The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `2 ** i` is less than or equal to `x`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 0 and `x` is greater than or equal to 2. Since `2 ** 0` is 1, which is less than or equal to `x`, the loop can certainly execute one time. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
