Output State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, and stdin contains 1 input: t space-separated integers.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains 1 input: t space-separated integers.
