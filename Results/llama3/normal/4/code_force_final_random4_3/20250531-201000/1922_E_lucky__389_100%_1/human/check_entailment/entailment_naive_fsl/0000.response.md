Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the input X = 3. The program should output an array with exactly 3 increasing subsequences, but the output is:

1
0

This output has only 2 increasing subsequences: [] and [0]. The correct output for X = 3 should be an array with 3 increasing subsequences, such as [0, 1].

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle the case when X is not a power of 2. The program tries to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to X and then subtracts it from X, but this approach does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly X increasing subsequences.
