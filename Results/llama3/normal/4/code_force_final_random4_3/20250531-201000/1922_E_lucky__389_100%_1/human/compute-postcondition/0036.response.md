According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is greater than or equal to 2. Since `x` is already greater than 0, no adjustment is needed for `x` to ensure the loop can execute again.

State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 2. If `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is not equal to 0, `subseq_lens` has been appended with the value of `i - 1`, and `mx` is equal to the maximum of its original value and `i - 1**
