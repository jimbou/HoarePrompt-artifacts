Output State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers that must have at least `len(subseq_lens)` elements, `mx` is the maximum length of these subsequences, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` plus all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one, `i` is `len(subseq_lens)-1`, and stdin contains 1 input: t space-separated integers.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The value of `x` remains 0, the list `subseq_lens` has at least as many elements as its length, the maximum length `mx` of these subsequences remains the same, the list `ansv` now includes all integers from 0 to `mx-1` plus all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one, the loop counter `i` reaches the last index of `subseq_lens`, and the input in stdin remains unchanged.
