To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved in it.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `subseq_lens`. Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `mx` is the maximum length of these subsequences, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` plus the second and third element of `subseq_lens`, `i` is 3**
