Output State: **`x` is an integer between 4 and 1000, `i` is 2, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, stdin contains 1 input: t space-separated integers.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains 1 input: t space-separated integers.
