Postcondition: ***`x` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(x) + 1. If `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `subseq_lens` contains the value `i - 1`, and `mx` is the maximum value between its original value and `i - 1`.***
