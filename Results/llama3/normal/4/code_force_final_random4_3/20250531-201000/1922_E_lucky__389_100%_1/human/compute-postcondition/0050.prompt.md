Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *x is an integer between 1 and 1000, x is not equal to 2, stdin contains 1 input: t space-separated integers, subseq_lens is an empty list, mx is 0
Code of the loop:
while x != 0:
    i = 0
    while 2 ** i <= x:
        i += 1
    if i == 0:
        break
    else:
        subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
        x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
        mx = max(mx, i - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `x` is not equal to 2, `i` is the smallest integer such that 2 to the power of `i` is greater than `x`, `subseq_lens` is a list containing `i - 1` if `i` is not 0, otherwise it is an empty list, `mx` is the maximum of 0 and `i - 1`, and stdin contains 1 input: t space-separated integers. If `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`x` is greater than or equal to 2. If `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is not equal to 0, `subseq_lens` has been appended with the value of `i - 1`, and `mx` is equal to the maximum of its original value and `i - 1`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`x` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(x) + 1. If `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `subseq_lens` contains the value `i - 1`, and `mx` is the maximum value between its original value and `i - 1`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
