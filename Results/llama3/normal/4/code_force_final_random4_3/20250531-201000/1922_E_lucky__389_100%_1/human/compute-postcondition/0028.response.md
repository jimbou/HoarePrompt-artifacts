The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `2 ** i` is less than or equal to `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `x` is greater than or equal to 4. Since `2 ** 2` is 4, we need to ensure that `x` is greater than 4 for the loop to execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, and stdin contains 1 input: t space-separated integers.**
