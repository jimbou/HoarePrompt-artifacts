Output State: **x is 0, subseq_lens is a list of integers representing the lengths of the subsequences of consecutive powers of 2 that sum up to the original value of x, mx is the maximum length of these subsequences, and stdin contains 1 input: t space-separated integers.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of x has been reduced to 0, and the list subseq_lens contains the lengths of the subsequences of consecutive powers of 2 that sum up to the original value of x. The variable mx holds the maximum length of these subsequences. The state of the other variables, including stdin, remains unchanged.
