According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If 2 to the power of `i` is less than or equal to `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2, and `x` must be greater than or equal to 4 (since 2^2 = 4). No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2**
