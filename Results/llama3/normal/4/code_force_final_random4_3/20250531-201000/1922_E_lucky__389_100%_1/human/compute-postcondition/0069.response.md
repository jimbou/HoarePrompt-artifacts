Output: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers that must have at least `len(subseq_lens)` elements, `mx` is the maximum length of these subsequences, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` plus all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, and stdin contains 1 input: t space-separated integers, and the 2nd element of the list `ansv` which is 0 is being printed, and this is printed: 0**
