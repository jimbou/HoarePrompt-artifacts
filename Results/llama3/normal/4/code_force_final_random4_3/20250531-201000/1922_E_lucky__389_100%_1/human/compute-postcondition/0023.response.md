Output State: **`x` is not equal to 0, `i` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing `i - 1` if `i` is not 0, otherwise it is an empty list, `mx` is the maximum of 0 and `i - 1`, and stdin contains 1 input: t space-separated integers.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been changed to 0. The other variables `x`, `subseq_lens`, and `mx` are still valid and their values are not affected by the code. The value of `subseq_lens` is an empty list because `i` is 0, and the value of `mx` is 0 because it is the maximum of 0 and `i - 1`, which is -1. The stdin still contains 1 input: t space-separated integers.
