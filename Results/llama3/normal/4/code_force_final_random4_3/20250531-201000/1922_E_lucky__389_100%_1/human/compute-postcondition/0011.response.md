The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and its initial value is 0, so the new value of `i` is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains 1 input: t space-separated integers.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is 1, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, stdin contains 1 input: t space-separated integers.**
