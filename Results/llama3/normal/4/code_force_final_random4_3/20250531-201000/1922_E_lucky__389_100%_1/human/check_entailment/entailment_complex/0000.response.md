Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array of integers with exactly X increasing subsequences. The program uses a greedy approach to construct the array by finding the lengths of the subsequences of consecutive powers of 2 that sum up to the original value of X.

The program correctly handles the case when X is 2, printing 1 and 0 as required. For other values of X, it calculates the lengths of the subsequences, finds the maximum length, and constructs the array of integers.

The program then prints the length of the array and its elements, separated by spaces. The output format matches the required format specified in the problem statement.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. The function `func_1()` is not defined anywhere in the code. It seems that the function is supposed to read the input and call the main logic of the program, but its implementation is missing.

2. The variable `t` is not used anywhere in the code. It seems that it is supposed to represent the number of test cases, but its value is not utilized.

3. The program does not handle the case when X is 1. According to the problem statement, X is a positive integer, so X can be 1. However, the program does not handle this case explicitly.

4. The program does not handle the case when X is greater than 2^64 - 1. According to the problem statement, X can be up to 10^18, which is greater than 2^64 - 1. However, the program uses 64-bit integers to represent X, which may cause overflow for large values of X.

5. The program does not handle the case when the input is invalid. According to the problem statement, the input should be a positive integer, but the program does not check for invalid inputs.

6. The program does not follow the required output format for the case when there is no array with exactly X increasing subsequences. According to the problem statement, the program should print -1 in this case, but the program does not handle this case explicitly.

7. The program does not handle the case when the array has more than 200 elements. According to the problem statement, the array should have at most 200 elements, but the program does not check for this condition.

8. The program does not handle the case when the elements of the array are not in the range [-10^9, 10^9]. According to the problem statement, the elements of the array should be in this range, but the program does not check for this condition.

Correctness: **False**
