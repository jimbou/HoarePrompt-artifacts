Output: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers that must have at least `len(subseq_lens)` elements, `mx` is the maximum length of these subsequences, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` plus all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one, `i` is `len(subseq_lens)-1`, and stdin contains 1 input: t space-separated integers, and the length of ansv which is equal to mx + len(subseq_lens) -1 is being printed**
