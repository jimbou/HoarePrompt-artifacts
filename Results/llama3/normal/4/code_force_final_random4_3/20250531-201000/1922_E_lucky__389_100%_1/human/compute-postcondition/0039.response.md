Output State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `x` remains the same, which is greater than or equal to 2. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. We are still breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.
