This function reads an integer input from stdin, representing the number of subsequences of consecutive powers of 2 that sum up to the original value. If the input is 2, it prints 1 and 0 and returns without modifying the state. Otherwise, it calculates the lengths of these subsequences, finds the maximum length, and constructs a list of integers from 0 to the maximum length minus 1, plus all subsequence lengths except the first one. It then prints the length of this list and its elements, separated by spaces. The function does not return any value or modify the input variables, but instead prints the results to stdout.
