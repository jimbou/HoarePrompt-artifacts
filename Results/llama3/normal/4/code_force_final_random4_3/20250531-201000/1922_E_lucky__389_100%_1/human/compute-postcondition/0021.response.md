Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `x` is not equal to 2, `i` is the smallest integer such that 2 to the power of `i` is greater than `x`, `subseq_lens` is a list containing `i - 1` if `i` is not 0, otherwise it is an empty list, `mx` is the maximum of 0 and `i - 1`, and stdin contains 1 input: t space-separated integers. If `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
