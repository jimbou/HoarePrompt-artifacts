The only variable in the loop head is variable x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x.  If x is not equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, x is an integer between 1 and 1000, x is not equal to 2. Since x is already not equal to 0 (it's between 1 and 1000), no adjustment is needed.

State: **x is an integer between 1 and 1000, x is not equal to 2, stdin contains 1 input: t space-separated integers, subseq_lens is an empty list, mx is 0**
