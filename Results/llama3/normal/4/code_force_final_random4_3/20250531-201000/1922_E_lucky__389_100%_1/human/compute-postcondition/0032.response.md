Output State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `x` and `i` remain unchanged, as the `break` statement only exits the innermost loop or if statement, without modifying any variables. The condition `x` is greater than or equal to 2 still holds, and the value of `i` remains 0.
