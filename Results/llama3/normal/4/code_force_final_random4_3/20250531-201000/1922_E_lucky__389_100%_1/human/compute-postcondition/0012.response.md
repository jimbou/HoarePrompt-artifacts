To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `x` and `i` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `2 ** i` is less than or equal to `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `x` is an integer between 2 and 1000. Since `2 ** 1` is 2, which is less than or equal to `x`, we need to ensure that `2 ** (i + 1)` is also less than or equal to `x`. This means `x` must be greater than or equal to `2 ** 2`, which is 4.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` is an integer between 4 and 1000, `i` is 1, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, stdin contains 1 input: t space-separated integers.**
