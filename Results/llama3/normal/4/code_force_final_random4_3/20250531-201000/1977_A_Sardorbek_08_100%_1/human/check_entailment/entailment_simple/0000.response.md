Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether it is possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, based on the problem description.

The program first reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of moves (n) and the desired number of cubes (m).

The program then checks the following conditions:

1. If n is equal to m, it prints "YES" because it is possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes by putting one cube on top of the tower n times.

2. If n is less than m, it prints "NO" because it is not possible to build a tower with more cubes than the number of moves.

3. If n is greater than m, it checks if n and m have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd). If they do, it prints "Yes" because it is possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes by putting one cube on top of the tower n times and then removing some cubes to get the desired number of cubes. If n and m do not have the same parity, it prints "No" because it is not possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
