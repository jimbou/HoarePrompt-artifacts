Postcondition: ***a is greater than 0, i is 0, b and c are integers, q is a tuple containing two integers, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). If b is equal to c, 'YES' is printed. If b is not equal to c, then if b is less than c, 'NO' is printed. If b is not less than c, then if b and c have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.***
