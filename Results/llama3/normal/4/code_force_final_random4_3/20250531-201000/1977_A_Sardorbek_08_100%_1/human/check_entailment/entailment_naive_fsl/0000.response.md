Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly handles all possible cases. The problem description states that Nikita can either put exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or remove exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower in one move. The program checks if the number of moves (n) is equal to the number of cubes (m), in which case it prints "YES". If n is less than m, it prints "NO" because Nikita cannot have more cubes than moves. If n is greater than m, it checks if n and m have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd). If they do, it prints "YES" because Nikita can always end up with m cubes by making n moves. If n and m have different parity, it prints "NO" because Nikita cannot end up with m cubes by making n moves.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where n is equal to m, n is less than m, and n is greater than m. It also correctly handles the cases where n and m have the same parity and different parity. Therefore, the program is correct.
