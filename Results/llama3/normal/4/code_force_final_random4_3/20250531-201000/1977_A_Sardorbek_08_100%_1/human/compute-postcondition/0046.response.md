Output State: **a is equal to 0, i is equal to the initial value of a, b and c are integers, q is a tuple containing two integers, stdin is empty. If b equals c, 'YES' is printed a times. If b is less than c, 'NO' is printed a times. If b is greater than c, if b and c have the same parity, 'Yes' is printed a times. Otherwise, 'No' is printed a times.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of 'a' will be 0, and the value of 'i' will be equal to the initial value of 'a'. The values of 'b' and 'c' will be the last pair of integers read from the input, and 'q' will be a tuple containing these two integers. The input will be empty, as all lines will have been read. The output will depend on the values of 'b' and 'c' in each iteration. If 'b' equals 'c', 'YES' will be printed 'a' times. If 'b' is less than 'c', 'NO' will be printed 'a' times. If 'b' is greater than 'c', if 'b' and 'c' have the same parity, 'Yes' will be printed 'a' times. Otherwise, 'No' will be printed 'a' times.
