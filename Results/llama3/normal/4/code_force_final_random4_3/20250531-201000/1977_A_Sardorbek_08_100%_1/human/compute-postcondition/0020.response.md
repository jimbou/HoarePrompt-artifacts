The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `a` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than 1.
State: **`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` and `c` are integers, `q` is a tuple containing two integers, `stdin` contains `t-2` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 100). If `b` is equal to `c`, 'YES' is printed. If `b` is not equal to `c`, then if `b` is less than `c`, 'NO' is printed. If `b` is not less than `c`, then if `b` and `c` have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**
