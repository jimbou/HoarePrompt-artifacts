This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of two integers. It then compares these integers and prints 'YES' if they are equal, 'NO' if the first integer is less than the second, 'Yes' if the first integer is greater than the second and they have the same parity, and 'No' otherwise. The function repeats this process for the specified number of test cases, leaving the input stream empty upon completion.
