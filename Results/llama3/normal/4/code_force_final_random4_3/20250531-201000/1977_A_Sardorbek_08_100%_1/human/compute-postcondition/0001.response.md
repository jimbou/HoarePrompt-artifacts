To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `a` and `i` since they are the only variables in the loop head.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, we can adjust the state to `a` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0 (since the loop starts from 0).

State: **`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100)**
