Output State: **a is greater than 2, i is 2, b is an integer, c is an integer, q is a tuple containing two integers, stdin contains t-5 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). If b equals c, 'YES' is being printed. If b is less than c, 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, if b and c have the same parity, 'Yes' is being printed. Otherwise, 'No' is being printed.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `b` and `c`, respectively. The second line creates a tuple `q` containing the values of `b` and `c`. 

After the execution of the code, `b` and `c` are assigned the values of the two integers read from stdin. The tuple `q` is created with these values. The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged. Stdin now contains t-5 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). The printing conditions remain the same.
