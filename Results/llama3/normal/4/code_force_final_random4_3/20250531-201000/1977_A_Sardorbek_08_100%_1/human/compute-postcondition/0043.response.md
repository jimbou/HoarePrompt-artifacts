Postcondition: ***a is greater than 2, i is 2, b is an integer, c is an integer, q is a tuple containing two integers, stdin contains t-5 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). If b equals c, 'YES' is being printed. If b is less than c, 'NO' is being printed. If b and c have the same parity, 'Yes' is being printed. Otherwise, 'No' is being printed.***
