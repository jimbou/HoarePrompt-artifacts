Reasoning:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. If `b` (the number of moves) is equal to `c` (the number of cubes), it's possible to build a tower with exactly `c` cubes by adding one cube at a time, so the program correctly prints 'YES'.

2. If `b` is less than `c`, it's impossible to build a tower with exactly `c` cubes because Nikita can't add more cubes than the number of moves he has, so the program correctly prints 'NO'.

3. If `b` is greater than `c` and they have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), it's possible to build a tower with exactly `c` cubes by adding and removing cubes in a way that leaves `c` cubes at the end. For example, if `b` is 5 and `c` is 3, Nikita can add 3 cubes, remove 1, and then add 1 to end up with 3 cubes. The program correctly prints 'Yes' in this case.

4. If `b` is greater than `c` but they have different parity, it's impossible to build a tower with exactly `c` cubes because Nikita can't change the parity of the number of cubes by adding and removing cubes, so the program correctly prints 'No'.

Correctness: **True**
