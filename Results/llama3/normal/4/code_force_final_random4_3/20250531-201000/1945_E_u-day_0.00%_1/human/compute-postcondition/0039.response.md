Postcondition: ***low is equal to high, st is a set containing all the mid values calculated during the loop execution, n is greater than or equal to 0, i is n-1, k is a reassigned value returned by func_1(), arr is a reassigned value returned by func_2(), pos is either i or -1 depending on whether arr[i] equals k. If the current value of arr[low] is equal to k, then the value 0 is printed. Otherwise, the value 1 is printed, and the value of low + 1 and pos + 1 is printed, where low + 1 is equal to high + 1 and pos + 1 is either i + 1 or 0 depending on whether arr[i] equals k.***
