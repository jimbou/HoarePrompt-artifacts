Output State: **n is greater than or equal to 0, i is n-1, k is a reassigned value returned by func_1(), arr is a reassigned value returned by func_2(), pos is either i or -1 depending on whether arr[i] equals k, low is 0, high is n-1, st is an empty set**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `k`, `arr`, and `pos` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the given code snippet. The code only introduces two new variables, `low` and `high`, which are assigned the values 0 and `n-1`, respectively. Additionally, an empty set `st` is created. The relationship between `arr`, `i`, `k`, and `pos` remains the same as in the initial state.
