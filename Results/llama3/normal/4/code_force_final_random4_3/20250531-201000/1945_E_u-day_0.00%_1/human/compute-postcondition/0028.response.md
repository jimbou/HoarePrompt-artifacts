Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is a reassigned value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a reassigned value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is either `i` or `-1` depending on whether `arr[i]` equals `k`, `st` is a set containing `mid` and possibly other elements, `low` is equal to `mid`, `high` is either greater than `mid` or `mid + 1`, `mid` is the average of `low` and `high`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 2, `i` is still `n-1`, `k` and `arr` are still reassigned values returned by their respective functions, `pos` is still either `i` or `-1` depending on the condition, `st` still contains `mid` and possibly other elements, `low` is now equal to `mid`, `high` is still either greater than `mid` or `mid + 1`, and `mid` is still the average of `low` and `high`.
