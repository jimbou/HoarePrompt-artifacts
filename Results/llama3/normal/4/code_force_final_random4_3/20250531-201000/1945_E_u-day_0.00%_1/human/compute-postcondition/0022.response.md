Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is a reassigned value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a reassigned value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is either `i` or `-1` depending on whether `arr[i]` equals `k`, `st` is a set containing `mid` and possibly other elements, `low` is less than `mid - 1`, `high` is `mid`, `mid` is the average of `low` and `mid`.**

In this output state, the value of `high` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, which is the average of `low` and `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `mid` is now also equal to `high`, since `high` has been updated to be equal to `mid`.
