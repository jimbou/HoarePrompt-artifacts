You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and pos is the index of k in arr.
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is a reassigned value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a reassigned value returned by `func_2()`. If the current value of `arr` at index `i` is equal to the current value of `k`, then `pos` is `i`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1.
    low, high = 0, n - 1
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: low is equal to high, st is a set containing all the mid values calculated during the loop execution, n is greater than or equal to 0, i is n-1, k is a reassigned value returned by func_1(), arr is a reassigned value returned by func_2(), pos is either i or -1 depending on whether arr[i] equals k.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: (the next index after low, either n or 0)
    #State: *low is equal to high, st is a set containing all the mid values calculated during the loop execution, n is greater than or equal to 0, i is n-1, k is a reassigned value returned by func_1(), arr is a reassigned value returned by func_2(), pos is either i or -1 depending on whether arr[i] equals k. If the current value of arr[low] is equal to k, then the value 0 is printed. Otherwise, the value 1 is printed, and the value of low + 1 and pos + 1 is printed, where low + 1 is equal to high + 1 and pos + 1 is either i + 1 or 0 depending on whether arr[i] equals k.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: low is equal to high, st is a set containing all the mid values calculated during the loop execution, n is greater than or equal to 0, i is n-1, k is a reassigned value returned by func_1(), arr is a reassigned value returned by func_2(), pos is either i or -1 depending on whether arr[i] equals k. The current value of arr[low] is equal to k, and the value 0 is being printed

Case_2: low is equal to high, st is a set containing all the mid values calculated during the loop execution, n is greater than or equal to 0, i is n-1, k is a reassigned value returned by func_1(), arr is a reassigned value returned by func_2(), pos is either i or -1 depending on whether arr[i] equals k, and the value at index low in arr is not equal to k, and 1 is printed, and the value of low + 1 and pos + 1 is printed, where low + 1 is equal to high + 1 and pos + 1 is either i + 1 or 0 depending on whether arr[i] equals k


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
