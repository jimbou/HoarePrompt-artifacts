Output State: **n is greater than 2, i is n-1, k is a reassigned value returned by func_1(), arr is a reassigned value returned by func_2(), pos is either i or -1 depending on whether arr[i] equals k, low is 0, high is n-1, st is a set containing mid, mid is (0 + n-1) // 2**

The code snippet calculates the middle index `mid` of the range defined by `low` and `high`, and adds this index to the set `st`. The value of `mid` is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2, which is equivalent to the average of `low` and `high` rounded down to the nearest integer. Since `low` is 0 and `high` is `n-1`, `mid` becomes `(0 + n-1) // 2`, which simplifies to `(n-1) // 2`. The set `st` now contains this calculated value of `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged.
