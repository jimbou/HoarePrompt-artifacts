Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is a reassigned value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a reassigned value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is either `i` or `-1` depending on whether `arr[i]` equals `k`, `st` is a set containing `mid` and possibly other elements, `low` is equal to `mid`, `high` is updated based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` and `k`, `mid` is the average of `low` and `high`**.

In this output state, the value of `low` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `high` and `mid` is still maintained, as `mid` is the average of `low` and `high`. The values of `n`, `i`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, and `st` are still the same as in the initial state.
