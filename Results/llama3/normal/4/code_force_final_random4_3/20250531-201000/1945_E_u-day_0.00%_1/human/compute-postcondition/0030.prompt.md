Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is greater than or equal to 0, i is n-1, k is a reassigned value returned by func_1(), arr is a reassigned value returned by func_2(), pos is either i or -1 depending on whether arr[i] equals k, low is 0, high is n-1, st is an empty set
Code of the loop:
while low + 1 < high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    st.add(mid)
    if arr[mid] > k:
        high = mid
    else:
        low = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is greater than 2, i is n-1, k is a reassigned value returned by func_1(), arr is a reassigned value returned by func_2(), pos is either i or -1 depending on whether arr[i] equals k, st is a set containing mid, low and high are updated based on the comparison of arr[mid] and k. If arr[mid] is greater than k, low remains 0 and high is updated to mid. If arr[mid] is less than or equal to k, low is updated to mid and high remains n-1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *n is greater than 2, i is n-1, k is a reassigned value returned by func_1(), arr is a reassigned value returned by func_2(), pos is either i or -1 depending on whether arr[i] equals k, st is a set containing mid and possibly other elements. If arr[mid] > k, then low is less than mid - 1 and high is mid. Otherwise, low is equal to mid. mid is the average of low and high.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *n is greater than 2, i is n-1, k is a reassigned value returned by func_1(), arr is a reassigned value returned by func_2(), pos is either i or -1 depending on whether arr[i] equals k, st is a set containing mid and possibly other elements. If arr[mid] is greater than k, then low is either less than mid - 1 or equal to mid, and high is equal to mid. Otherwise, low is equal to mid, and high is either greater than mid or mid + 1. In both cases, mid is the average of low and high.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
