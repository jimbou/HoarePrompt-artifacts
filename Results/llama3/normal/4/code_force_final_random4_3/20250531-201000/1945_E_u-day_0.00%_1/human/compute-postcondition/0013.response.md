To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `low + 1 < high`. The variables involved in this condition are `low` and `high`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 0
- `i` is `n-1`
- `k` is a reassigned value returned by `func_1()`
- `arr` is a reassigned value returned by `func_2()`
- `pos` is either `i` or `-1` depending on whether `arr[i]` equals `k`
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `n-1`
- `st` is an empty set

The condition `low + 1 < high` needs to be satisfied for the loop to execute. Since `low` is 0 and `high` is `n-1`, we need to ensure that `0 + 1 < n - 1`. Simplifying this, we get `1 < n - 1`, which further simplifies to `2 < n`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 2. This is because if `n` were 2 or less, the condition `low + 1 < high` would not be met, and the loop would not execute.

The states of `i`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, and `st` do not affect the loop's ability to execute the first time, as they are not part of the loop condition. Thus, we only need to adjust the state of `n` to ensure the loop can proceed.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is a reassigned value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a reassigned value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is either `i` or `-1` depending on whether `arr[i]` equals `k`, `low` is 0, `high` is `n-1`, `st` is an empty set**
