The code snippet provided consists of three lines. The first line calls a function `func_1()` and assigns its return values to `n` and `k`. The second line calls another function `func_2()` and assigns its return value to `arr`. The third line assigns the value `-1` to `pos`.

Since the functions `func_1()` and `func_2()` are not defined in the provided code snippet, we cannot determine their exact behavior or the values they return. However, based on the initial state and the code provided, we can infer the following:

- The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a positive integer such that `1 <= k <= n`. After the first line executes, `n` and `k` will be reassigned the values returned by `func_1()`. Without knowing the specifics of `func_1()`, we can't determine the exact values of `n` and `k` after this line, but they will be set based on the function's return values.
- The initial state also mentions that `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order. After the second line executes, `arr` will be reassigned the value returned by `func_2()`. Again, without the specifics of `func_2()`, we can't determine the exact value of `arr`, but it will be set based on the function's return value.
- The variable `pos` is initially described as the index of `k` in `arr`. After the third line executes, `pos` will be set to `-1`, indicating that the index of `k` in `arr` is no longer tracked or is considered invalid after the execution of the code snippet.

Given the lack of information about the functions `func_1()` and `func_2()`, the final state of `n`, `k`, and `arr` cannot be precisely determined. However, we can state the following about the output state:

Output State: **n and k are reassigned values returned by func_1(), arr is reassigned the value returned by func_2(), and pos is -1.**
