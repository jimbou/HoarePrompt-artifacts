Postcondition: ***n is greater than 2, i is n-1, k is a reassigned value returned by func_1(), arr is a reassigned value returned by func_2(), pos is either i or -1 depending on whether arr[i] equals k, st is a set containing mid and possibly other elements. If arr[mid] > k, then low is less than mid - 1 and high is mid. Otherwise, low is equal to mid. mid is the average of low and high.***
