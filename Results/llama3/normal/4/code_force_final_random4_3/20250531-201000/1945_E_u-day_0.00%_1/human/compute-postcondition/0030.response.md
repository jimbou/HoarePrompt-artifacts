Output State: **low is equal to high, st is a set containing all the mid values calculated during the loop execution, n is greater than or equal to 0, i is n-1, k is a reassigned value returned by func_1(), arr is a reassigned value returned by func_2(), pos is either i or -1 depending on whether arr[i] equals k.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the search space defined by low and high has been narrowed down to a single point, where low is equal to high. The set st contains all the mid values calculated during the loop execution. The other variables, n, i, k, arr, and pos, remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
