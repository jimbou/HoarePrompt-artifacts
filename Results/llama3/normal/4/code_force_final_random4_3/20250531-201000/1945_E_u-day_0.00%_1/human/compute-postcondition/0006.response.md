Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is a reassigned value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a reassigned value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `pos` has been updated to 1, regardless of the previous condition that checked if the current value of `arr` at index `i` is equal to the current value of `k`. The values of `n`, `i`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code.
