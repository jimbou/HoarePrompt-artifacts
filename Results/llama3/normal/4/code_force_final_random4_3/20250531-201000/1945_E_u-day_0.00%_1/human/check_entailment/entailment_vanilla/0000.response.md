Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the input using the `func_1` and `func_2` functions, which correctly parse the input into integers and store them in a list.

2. The program then finds the position of the target number `k` in the array `arr` using a simple linear search. This is correct.

3. The program then performs a binary search on the array `arr` to find the target number `k`. However, the array is not sorted, which is a requirement for binary search. The program attempts to work around this by swapping elements in the array before performing the binary search.

4. The program checks if the element at the `low` index is equal to the target number `k`. If it is, the program prints 0, indicating that no swaps are needed. This is correct.

5. If the element at the `low` index is not equal to the target number `k`, the program prints 1, indicating that one swap is needed. The program then prints the indices of the `low` element and the target number `k`, which are the indices that need to be swapped. This is correct.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program only checks if the element at the `low` index is equal to the target number `k`, but it does not check if the element at the `high` index is equal to the target number `k`. This means that if the target number `k` is at the `high` index, the program will incorrectly print 1 and swap the wrong elements.

Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.

Correctness: **False**
