This function searches for a target value `k` in a list of distinct integers `arr` and determines its presence and position. It first finds the index `pos` of `k` in `arr` if it exists. Then, it performs a binary search to find the position of `k` in `arr`. If `k` is found at the final search position `low`, it prints 0. If `k` is not found, it prints 1 and the next index after `low` (which is `high + 1`) and the position of `k` in `arr` (either `i + 1` or 0). The function does not modify the input list `arr` or the target value `k`.
