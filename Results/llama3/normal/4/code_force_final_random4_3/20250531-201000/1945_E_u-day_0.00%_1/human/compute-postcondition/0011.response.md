Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is a reassigned value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a reassigned value returned by `func_2()`. If the current value of `arr` at index `i` is equal to the current value of `k`, then `pos` is `i`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` will be the same as the initial value, `i` will be the last index of the loop (i.e., `n-1`), and `k` and `arr` will still be the reassigned values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()`, respectively. The value of `pos` will be the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.
