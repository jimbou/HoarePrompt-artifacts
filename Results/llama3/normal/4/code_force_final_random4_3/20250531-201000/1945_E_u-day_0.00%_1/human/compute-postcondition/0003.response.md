Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is a reassigned value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a reassigned value returned by `func_2()`, and `pos` is 0. The current value of `arr` at index `i` is equal to the current value of `k`**

In this output state, the value of `pos` has been updated to 0, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the relationship between the current value of `arr` at index `i` and the current value of `k` is still valid.
