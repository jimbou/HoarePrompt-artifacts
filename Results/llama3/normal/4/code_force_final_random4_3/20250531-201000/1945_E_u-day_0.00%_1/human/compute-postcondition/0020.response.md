To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `low` and `high` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `low + 1 < high`. At the end of the last iteration, `low` and `high` are updated based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` and `k`. To guarantee the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that `low` is not equal to `high - 1`.

Since `n` is greater than 2, `high` is initially `n-1`. If `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, `high` is updated to `mid`, which is less than `n-1`. If `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `k`, `low` is updated to `mid`, which is less than `n-1`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `low` and `high` such that `low` is not equal to `high - 1`. We can do this by ensuring that `low` is less than `high - 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is a reassigned value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a reassigned value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is either `i` or `-1` depending on whether `arr[i]` equals `k`, `st` is a set containing `mid`, `low` is less than `high - 1`, `high` is updated based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` and `k`**
