Output State: **n is greater than 2, i is n-1, k is a reassigned value returned by func_1(), arr is a reassigned value returned by func_2(), pos is either i or -1 depending on whether arr[i] equals k, st is a set containing mid and possibly other elements, low is either less than mid - 1 or equal to mid, high is either greater than mid or mid + 1, mid is the average of low and high**.

The code calculates the average of `low` and `high` and assigns it to `mid`. It then adds `mid` to the set `st`. The values of `n`, `i`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged.
