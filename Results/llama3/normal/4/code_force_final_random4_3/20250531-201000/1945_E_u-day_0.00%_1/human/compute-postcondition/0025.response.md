To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `low` and `high` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `low + 1 < high`. At the end of the last iteration, we know:

* `n` is greater than 2 (this information is not directly relevant to the loop condition)
* `i` is `n-1` (this information is not directly relevant to the loop condition)
* `k` is a reassigned value returned by `func_1()` (this information is not directly relevant to the loop condition)
* `arr` is a reassigned value returned by `func_2()` (this information is not directly relevant to the loop condition)
* `pos` is either `i` or `-1` depending on whether `arr[i]` equals `k` (this information is not directly relevant to the loop condition)
* `st` is a set containing `mid` and possibly other elements (this information is not directly relevant to the loop condition)
* `low` is either less than `mid - 1` or equal to `mid` (depending on the comparison of `arr[mid]` and `k`)
* `high` is either `mid` or greater than `mid` (depending on the comparison of `arr[mid]` and `k`)
* `mid` is the average of `low` and `high`

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the states of `low` and `high` so that `low + 1 < high`. Since we don't know the exact values of `low` and `high`, we can only adjust their relationship.

If `low` is less than `mid - 1`, then `low` must be less than `high - 1` to ensure the loop can execute again. If `low` is equal to `mid`, then `high` must be greater than `mid + 1` to ensure the loop can execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is a reassigned value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a reassigned value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is either `i` or `-1` depending on whether `arr[i]` equals `k`, `st` is a set containing `mid` and possibly other elements, `low` is either less than `mid - 1` or equal to `mid`, and `high` is either greater than `mid` or `mid + 1`**
