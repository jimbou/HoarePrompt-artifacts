Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is a reassigned value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a reassigned value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is either `i` or `-1` depending on whether `arr[i]` equals `k`, `st` is a set containing `mid` and possibly other elements, `low` is either less than `mid - 1` or equal to `mid`, `mid` is the average of `low` and `high`, and `high` is equal to `mid`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `high` is updated to be equal to `mid`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still greater than 2, `i` is still `n-1`, `k` and `arr` are still reassigned values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, `pos` is still either `i` or `-1` depending on whether `arr[i]` equals `k`, and `st` is still a set containing `mid` and possibly other elements. The relationship between `low` and `mid` remains the same, and `mid` is still the average of `low` and `high`, which is now equal to `mid`.
