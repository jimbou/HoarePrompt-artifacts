Based on the initial state, let's break down the variables and their values:

* `low` is equal to `high`
* `st` is a set containing all the mid values calculated during the loop execution (not relevant to the print statement)
* `n` is greater than or equal to 0
* `i` is `n-1`
* `k` is a reassigned value returned by `func_1()` (unknown value)
* `arr` is a reassigned value returned by `func_2()` (unknown value)
* `pos` is either `i` or `-1` depending on whether `arr[i]` equals `k`
* The value at index `low` in `arr` is not equal to `k`
* `1` is printed (not relevant to the print statement)

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(low + 1, pos + 1)`

* `low + 1`: Since `low` is equal to `high`, we can't determine the exact value of `low`. However, we know that `low` is an index in the `arr` list. Therefore, `low + 1` will be the next index after `low`.
* `pos + 1`: If `arr[i]` equals `k`, then `pos` is `i`, which is `n-1`. If `arr[i]` does not equal `k`, then `pos` is `-1`. In either case, adding `1` to `pos` will result in either `n` or `0`.

Since we can't determine the exact values of `low` and `pos`, we can't provide a precise numerical output. However, we can describe the output as:

Output: **(the next index after low, either n or 0)**
