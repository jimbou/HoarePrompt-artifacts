Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the binary search algorithm as described in the problem description. The problem description states that the loop should continue until `r - l = 1`, but the program's loop condition is `low + 1 < high`, which is not equivalent.

Moreover, the program does not correctly handle the case where the target element is not found in the array. According to the problem description, if the target element is not found, the program should output the indices of the elements that need to be swapped to make the array sorted. However, the program does not do this.

For example, if the input is `n = 5, x = 3, p = [3, 5, 4, 2, 1]`, the program will output `2` and then `2 4` and `1 5`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `2` and then the indices of the elements that need to be swapped to make the array sorted, which are `2 4` and `1 3`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
