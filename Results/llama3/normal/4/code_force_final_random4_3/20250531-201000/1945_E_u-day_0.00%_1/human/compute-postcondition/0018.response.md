Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is a reassigned value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a reassigned value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is either `i` or `-1` depending on whether `arr[i]` equals `k`, `low` is `(0 + n-1) // 2`, `high` is `n-1`, `st` is a set containing `(0 + n-1) // 2`, and `arr[(0 + n-1) // 2]` is less than or equal to `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `low` has been updated to be the middle index of the array, which is calculated as `(0 + n-1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged. The array `arr` and the set `st` still contain the same values, and the position `pos` is still determined by whether the element at index `i` in `arr` is equal to `k`. The bounds `high` and `n` are still the same, and `i` is still one less than `n`.
