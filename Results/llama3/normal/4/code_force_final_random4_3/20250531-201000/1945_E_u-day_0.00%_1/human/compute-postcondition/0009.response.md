Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is a reassigned value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a reassigned value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `pos` has been updated to be equal to the current value of `i`, which is 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The condition that determines the value of `pos` is no longer relevant, as `pos` is now directly assigned the value of `i`.
