Output State: **n is greater than 2, i is n-1, k is a reassigned value returned by func_1(), arr is a reassigned value returned by func_2(), pos is either i or -1 depending on whether arr[i] equals k, low is 0, high is (0 + n-1) // 2, st is a set containing (0 + n-1) // 2, mid is (0 + n-1) // 2. The current value of arr[mid] is greater than k.**

In this output state, the value of `high` has been updated to `(0 + n-1) // 2`, which is the same as the value of `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `arr[mid]` is greater than `k` still holds true.
