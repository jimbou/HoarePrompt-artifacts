Output State: **n is greater than 2, i is n-1, k is a reassigned value returned by func_1(), arr is a reassigned value returned by func_2(), pos is either i or -1 depending on whether arr[i] equals k, st is a set containing mid and possibly other elements, low is less than high - 1, high is updated based on the comparison of arr[mid] and k, mid is the average of low and high.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `k`, `arr`, and `pos` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet. The set `st` now contains the newly added element `mid`, in addition to any other elements it may have had before. The variables `low` and `high` maintain their relationship, with `low` being less than `high - 1`. The value of `high` is updated based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` and `k`, but the exact value is not specified. The variable `mid` is assigned the average of `low` and `high`.
