To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n` and `k` are reassigned values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is reassigned the value returned by `func_2()`, and `pos` is -1. However, these states do not guarantee that the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 0 and `i` to be 0 (the starting value of the range).

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is a reassigned value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a reassigned value returned by `func_2()`, and `pos` is -1**
