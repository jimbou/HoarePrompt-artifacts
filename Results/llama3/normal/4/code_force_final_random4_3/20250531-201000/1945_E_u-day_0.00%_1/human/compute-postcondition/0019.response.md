Postcondition: **n is greater than 2, i is n-1, k is a reassigned value returned by func_1(), arr is a reassigned value returned by func_2(), pos is either i or -1 depending on whether arr[i] equals k, st is a set containing mid, low and high are updated based on the comparison of arr[mid] and k. If arr[mid] is greater than k, low remains 0 and high is updated to mid. If arr[mid] is less than or equal to k, low is updated to mid and high remains n-1.**
