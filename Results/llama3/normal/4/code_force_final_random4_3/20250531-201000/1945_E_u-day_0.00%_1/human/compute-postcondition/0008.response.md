To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is a reassigned value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a reassigned value returned by `func_2()`. If the current value of `arr` at index `i` is equal to the current value of `k`, then `pos` is 1. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1.**
