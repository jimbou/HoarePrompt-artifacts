To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, results is an empty list, index is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with two inputs each: a list of integers and multiple pairs of integers. So for the loop to be executed  the t must be greater than 0 and _ is 0.
State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than 0, results is an empty list, index is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with two inputs each: a list of integers and multiple pairs of integers, _ is 0**
