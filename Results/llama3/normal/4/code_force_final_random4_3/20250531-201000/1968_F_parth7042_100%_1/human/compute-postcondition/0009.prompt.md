Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than 0, results is an empty list, index is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases with two inputs each: a list of integers and multiple pairs of integers, _ is 0, n is an integer, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 zeros, pf is a list of n+1 zeros, mp is a dictionary with a single key-value pair: 0 maps to a list containing a single element 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than 0, results is an empty list, index is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases with two inputs each: a list of integers and multiple pairs of integers, _ is 0, n is an integer and must be greater than 0, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the integer at index 3 of data, pf is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the XOR of the value at index 0 and the value at index 1 of a, mp is a dictionary with a key-value pair: the value at index 1 of pf maps to a list containing a single element 1, i is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than 0, results is an empty list, index is 5, stdin contains multiple test cases with two inputs each: a list of integers and multiple pairs of integers, _ is 0, n is an integer and must be greater than 1, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the integer at index 3 of data and the value at index 2 is the integer at index 4 of data, pf is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the XOR of the value at index 0 and the value at index 1 of a and the value at index 2 is the XOR of the value at index 1 and the value at index 2 of a, mp is a dictionary with a key-value pair: the value at index 1 of pf maps to a list containing a single element 1 and the value at index 2 of pf maps to a list containing a single element 2, i is 2

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than 0, results is an empty list, index is 6, stdin contains multiple test cases with two inputs each: a list of integers and multiple pairs of integers, _ is 0, n is an integer and must be greater than 2, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the integer at index 3 of data, the value at index 2 is the integer at index 4 of data, and the value at index 3 is the integer at index 5 of data, pf is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the XOR of the value at index 0 and the value at index 1 of a, the value at index 2 is the XOR of the value at index 1 and the value at index 2 of a, and the value at index 3 is the XOR of the value at index 2 and the value at index 3 of a, mp is a dictionary with a key-value pair: the value at index 1 of pf maps to a list containing a single element 1, the value at index 2 of pf maps to a list containing a single element 2, and the value at index 3 of pf maps to a list containing a single element 3, i is 3




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
