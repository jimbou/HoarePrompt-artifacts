Output State: **t is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than 0, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO'. If x is equal to 0, an additional 'YES' is appended to results. Otherwise, results remains unchanged. index is n + 9, _ is 2, n is an integer and must be greater than 0, q must be greater than 2, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the integer at index i + 2 of data for all i in range(1, n + 1), pf is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the XOR of the value at index i - 1 and the value at index i of a for all i in range(1, n + 1), mp is a dictionary with a key-value pair: the value at index i of pf maps to a list containing a single element i for all i in range(1, n + 1), i is n, l is an integer equal to the value at index n + 3 of data, r is an integer equal to the value at index n + 4 of data, x is an integer equal to the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1], v1 is a list containing all the indices i such that pf[i] is equal to pf[r], v2 is a list containing all the indices i such that pf[i] is equal to pf[l - 1], it1 is the index of the first occurrence of l in v1, it2 is the index of the last occurrence of r in v2.**
