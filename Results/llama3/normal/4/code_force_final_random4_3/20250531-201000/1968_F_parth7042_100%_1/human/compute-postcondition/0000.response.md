Output State: **t is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, results is an empty list, index is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with two inputs each: a list of integers and multiple pairs of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is the first input from stdin, which is an integer. The `results` list is empty, as it was initialized as an empty list. The `index` variable is 1, as it was incremented by 1 after reading the first input. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but each test case now has two inputs: a list of integers and multiple pairs of integers.
