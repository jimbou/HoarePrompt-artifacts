Output State: **t is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than 0, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop, index is n + 2 * q + 1, _ is q, n is an integer and must be greater than 0, q is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the integer at index i + 2 of data for all i in range(1, n + 1), pf is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the XOR of the value at index i - 1 and the value at index i of a for all i in range(1, n + 1), mp is a dictionary with a key-value pair: the value at index i of pf maps to a list containing a single element i for all i in range(1, n + 1), i is n, l is an integer equal to the value at index n + 2 * q + 1 of data, r is an integer equal to the value at index n + 2 * q + 2 of data, x is an integer equal to the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1], v1 is a list containing all the indices i such that pf[i] is equal to pf[r], v2 is a list containing all the indices i such that pf[i] is equal to pf[l - 1], it1 is the index of the first occurrence of l in v1, it2 is the index of the last occurrence of r in v2.**

This output state represents the final state of the program after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop has iterated q times, and for each iteration, it has appended either 'YES' or 'NO' to the results list based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The index variable has been incremented by 2 for each iteration, and the _ variable has been incremented by 1 for each iteration. The other variables remain unchanged.
