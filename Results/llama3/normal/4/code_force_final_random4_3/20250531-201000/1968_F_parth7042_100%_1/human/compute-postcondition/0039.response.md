The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is q, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is q + 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than q + 1.
State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than q + 1, `results` is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop, `index` is n + 2 * q + 1, `_` is q + 1, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `q` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the integer at index i + 2 of data for all i in range(1, n + 1), `pf` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the XOR of the value at index i - 1 and the value at index i of a for all i in range(1, n + 1), `mp` is a dictionary with a key-value pair: the value at index i of pf maps to a list containing a single element i for all i in range(1, n + 1), `i` is n, `l` is an integer equal to the value at index n + 2 * q + 1 of data, `r` is an integer equal to the value at index n + 2 * q + 2 of data, `x` is an integer equal to the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1], `v1` is a list containing all the indices i such that pf[i] is equal to pf[r], `v2` is a list containing all the indices i such that pf[i] is equal to pf[l - 1], `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of l in v1, `it2` is the index of the last occurrence of r in v2**
