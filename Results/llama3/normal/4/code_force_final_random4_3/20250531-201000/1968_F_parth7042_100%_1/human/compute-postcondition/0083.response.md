Output State: **n is an integer equal to the value at index `index - 2` of `data` and must be greater than 3, q is an integer equal to the value at index `index - 1` of `data`, index is `index + 2`, a is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[1]` is the integer value at index `index - 2` of `data`, `a[2]` is the integer value at index `index - 1` of `data`, and `a[4]` is the integer value at index `index` of `data`, pf is a list of `n+1` integers where `pf[1]` is the XOR of `pf[0]` and `a[1]`, `pf[2]` is the XOR of `pf[1]` and `a[2]`, and `pf[4]` is the XOR of `pf[3]` and `a[4]`, mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing a single element 0, `pf[1]` maps to a list containing a single element 1, `pf[2]` maps to a list containing a single element 2, and `pf[4]` maps to a list containing a single element 4, t is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than `q + 1 + 1`, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop, _ is `q + 1`, l is an integer equal to the value at index `n + 2 * q + 1` of `data`, r is an integer equal to the value at index `n + 2 * q + 2` of `data`, v1 is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[r]`, v2 is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[l - 1]`, it1 is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1`, it2 is the index of the last occurrence of `r` in `v2`, x is an integer equal to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and i is 4.**
