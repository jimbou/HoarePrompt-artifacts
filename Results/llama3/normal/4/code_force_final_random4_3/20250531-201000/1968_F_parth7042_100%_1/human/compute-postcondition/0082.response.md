The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the value at index `index - 1` of `data` and must be greater than 3, `q` is an integer equal to the value at index `index` of `data`, `index` is `index + 1`, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[1]` is the integer value at index `index - 1` of `data` and `a[2]` is the integer value at index `index` of `data`, `pf` is a list of `n+1` integers where `pf[1]` is the XOR of `pf[0]` and `a[1]` and `pf[2]` is the XOR of `pf[1]` and `a[2]`, `mp` is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing a single element 0, `pf[1]` maps to a list containing a single element 1, and `pf[2]` maps to a list containing a single element 2, `t` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than `q + 1 + 1`, `results` is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop, `_` is `q + 1`, `l` is an integer equal to the value at index `n + 2 * q + 1` of `data`, `r` is an integer equal to the value at index `n + 2 * q + 2` of `data`, `v1` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[r]`, `v2` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[l - 1]`, `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1`, `it2` is the index of the last occurrence of `r` in `v2`, `x` is an integer equal to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and `i` is 4**
