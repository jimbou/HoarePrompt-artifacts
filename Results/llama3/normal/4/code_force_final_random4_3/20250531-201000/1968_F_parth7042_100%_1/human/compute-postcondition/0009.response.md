Output State: **t is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than 0, results is an empty list, index is n + 3, stdin contains multiple test cases with two inputs each: a list of integers and multiple pairs of integers, _ is 0, n is an integer and must be greater than 0, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the integer at index i + 2 of data for all i in range(1, n + 1), pf is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the XOR of the value at index i - 1 and the value at index i of a for all i in range(1, n + 1), mp is a dictionary with a key-value pair: the value at index i of pf maps to a list containing a single element i for all i in range(1, n + 1), i is n**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the loop has iterated over all the elements in the list 'a' and has updated the prefix sum array 'pf' and the dictionary 'mp' accordingly. The loop has also updated the index to point to the next element in the input data. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
