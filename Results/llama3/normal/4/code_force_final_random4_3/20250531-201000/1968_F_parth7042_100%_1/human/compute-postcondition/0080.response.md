The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **n is an integer equal to the value at index `index` of `data` and must be greater than 1, q is an integer equal to the value at index `index + 1` of `data`, index is `index + 3`, a is a list of `n+1` integers where a[1] is the integer value at index `index` of `data`, pf is a list of `n+1` integers where pf[1] is the XOR of pf[0] and a[1], mp is a dictionary with a key-value pair: 0 maps to a list containing a single element 0, and pf[1] maps to a list containing a single element 1, t is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than `q + 1 + 1`, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop, _ is `q + 1`, l is an integer equal to the value at index `n + 2 * q + 1` of `data`, r is an integer equal to the value at index `n + 2 * q + 2` of `data`, v1 is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[r]`, v2 is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[l - 1]`, it1 is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1`, it2 is the index of the last occurrence of `r` in `v2`, x is an integer equal to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, i is 2**
