The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than 0, results is an empty list, index is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases with two inputs each: a list of integers and multiple pairs of integers, _ is 0, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 zeros, pf is a list of n+1 zeros, mp is a dictionary with a single key-value pair: 0 maps to a list containing a single element 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **t is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than 0, results is an empty list, index is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases with two inputs each: a list of integers and multiple pairs of integers, _ is 0, n is an integer and must be greater than 0, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 zeros, pf is a list of n+1 zeros, mp is a dictionary with a single key-value pair: 0 maps to a list containing a single element 0, i is 1**
