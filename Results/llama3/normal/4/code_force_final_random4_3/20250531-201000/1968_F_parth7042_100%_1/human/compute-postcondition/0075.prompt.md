Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than q + 1, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop, index is n + 2 * q + n + 1, _ is q + 1, n is an integer and must be greater than 0, q is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is equal to the value at index n + 2 * q + i of data and all other values are 0, pf is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is equal to the XOR of pf[i - 1] and a[i] and all other values are 0, mp is a dictionary with a key-value pair: 0 maps to a list containing a single element 0, and pf[i] maps to a list containing i, i is n, l is an integer equal to the value at index n + 2 * q + 1 of data, r is an integer equal to the value at index n + 2 * q + 2 of data, x is an integer equal to the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1], v1 is a list containing all the indices i such that pf[i] is equal to pf[r], v2 is a list containing all the indices i such that pf[i] is equal to pf[l - 1], it1 is the index of the first occurrence of l in v1, it2 is the index of the last occurrence of r in v2
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[index])
    r = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp[pf[r]]
    v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
    it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than q + 1, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop. If the current value of it1 is less than the length of v1, the current value of it2 is greater than or equal to 0, and the current value of v1[it1] is less than v2[it2], then results has one more 'YES' appended to it. Otherwise, results has one more 'NO' appended to it. index is n + 2 * q + n + 3, _ is 0, n is an integer and must be greater than 0, q must be greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is equal to the value at index n + 2 * q + i of data and all other values are 0, pf is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is equal to the XOR of pf[i - 1] and a[i] and all other values are 0, mp is a dictionary with a key-value pair: 0 maps to a list containing a single element 0, and pf[i] maps to a list containing i, i is n, l is an integer equal to the value at index n + 2 * q + 1 of data, r is an integer equal to the value at index n + 2 * q + 2 of data, x is an integer equal to the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1], v1 is a list containing all the indices i such that pf[i] is equal to pf[r], v2 is a list containing all the indices i such that pf[i] is equal to pf[l - 1], it1 is the index of the first occurrence of l in v1, it2 is the index of the last occurrence of r in v2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than q + 1, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop. If it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] < v2[it2]), results has one more 'YES' appended to it. Otherwise, results has one more 'NO' appended to it. index is n + 2 * q + n + 5, _ is 1, n is an integer and must be greater than 0, q must be greater than 1, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is equal to the value at index n + 2 * q + i of data and all other values are 0, pf is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is equal to the XOR of pf[i - 1] and a[i] and all other values are 0, mp is a dictionary with a key-value pair: 0 maps to a list containing a single element 0, and pf[i] maps to a list containing i, i is n, l is an integer equal to the value at index n + 2 * q + 1 of data, r is an integer equal to the value at index n + 2 * q + 2 of data, v1 is a list containing all the indices i such that pf[i] is equal to pf[r], v2 is a list containing all the indices i such that pf[i] is equal to pf[l - 1], it1 is the index of the first occurrence of l in v1, it2 is the index of the last occurrence of r in v2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than `q` + 1, `results` is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1` and `it2` is greater than or equal to 0 and `v1[it1]` is less than `v2[it2]`, then `results` has one more 'YES' appended to it. Otherwise, `results` has one more 'NO' appended to it. `index` is `n` + 2 * `q` + 7, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `q` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n`+1 integers where the value at index `i` is equal to the value at index `n` + 2 * `q` + `i` of `data` and all other values are 0, `pf` is a list of `n`+1 integers where the value at index `i` is equal to the XOR of `pf[i - 1]` and `a[i]` and all other values are 0, `mp` is a dictionary with a key-value pair: 0 maps to a list containing a single element 0, and `pf[i]` maps to a list containing `i`, `i` is `n`, `l` is an integer equal to the value at index `n` + 2 * `q` + 1 of `data`, `r` is an integer equal to the value at index `n` + 2 * `q` + 2 of `data`, `v1` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[r]`, `v2` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[l - 1]`, `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1`, `it2` is the index of the last occurrence of `r` in `v2`, `x` is an integer equal to `pf[r]` ^ `pf[l - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
