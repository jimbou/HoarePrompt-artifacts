Output State: **results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop, index is t * (n + 2 * q) + 1, t is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer equal to the value at index `index - (n - 1)` of `data` and must be greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer equal to the value at index `index - n` of `data` and must be greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[i]` is the integer value at index `index - (n - i)` of `data` for `i` in range 1 to `n`, pf is a list of `n+1` integers where `pf[i]` is the XOR of `pf[i - 1]` and `a[i]` for `i` in range 1 to `n`, mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing a single element 0, and `pf[i]` maps to a list containing a single element `i` for `i` in range 1 to `n`, _ is `q - 1`, l is an integer equal to the value at index `n + 2 * q + 1` of `data`, r is an integer equal to the value at index `n + 2 * q + 2` of `data`, v1 is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[r]`, v2 is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[l - 1]`, it1 is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1`, it2 is the index of the last occurrence of `r` in `v2`, x is an integer equal to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and i is `n + 1`. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1` and `it2` is greater than or equal to 0 and `v1[it1]` is less than `v2[it2]`, then results contains an additional 'YES'. Otherwise, results contains an additional 'NO'.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' strings for each iteration of the loop, where the index is calculated based on the number of iterations and the values of n and q. The values of n and q are determined by the values at specific indices in the data list. The list a contains the integer values at specific indices in the data list, and the list pf contains the XOR of the values in a. The dictionary mp maps the values in pf to their corresponding indices. The variables l, r, v1, v2, it1, it2, x, and i are calculated based on the values in a, pf, and mp. If the conditions are met, the results list contains an additional 'YES', otherwise it contains an additional 'NO'.
