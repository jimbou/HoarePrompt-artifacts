Output State: **t is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than 0, results is an empty list, index is 6, stdin contains multiple test cases with two inputs each: a list of integers and multiple pairs of integers, _ is 0, n is an integer and must be greater than 2, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the integer at index 3 of data, the value at index 2 is the integer at index 4 of data, and the value at index 3 is the integer at index 5 of data, pf is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the XOR of the value at index 0 and the value at index 1 of a, the value at index 2 is the XOR of the value at index 1 and the value at index 2 of a, and the value at index 3 is the XOR of the value at index 2 and the value at index 3 of a, mp is a dictionary with a key-value pair: the value at index 1 of pf maps to a list containing a single element 1, the value at index 2 of pf maps to a list containing a single element 2, and the value at index 3 of pf maps to a list containing a single element 3, i is 3**
