To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The value of `n` remains the same, but for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `index` is 5, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with two inputs each: a list of integers and multiple pairs of integers, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 2, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index 1 is the integer at index 3 of data and the value at index 2 is the integer at index 4 of data, `pf` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index 1 is the XOR of the value at index 0 and the value at index 1 of `a` and the value at index 2 is the XOR of the value at index 1 and the value at index 2 of `a`, `mp` is a dictionary with a key-value pair: the value at index 1 of `pf` maps to a list containing a single element 1 and the value at index 2 of `pf` maps to a list containing a single element 2, `i` is 3**
