Output State: **t is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than q + 1, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop, index is n + 2 * q + 3, _ is q + 1, n is an integer and must be greater than 0, q is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of n+1 integers where all values are 0, pf is a list of n+1 integers where all values are 0, mp is a dictionary with a key-value pair: 0 maps to a list containing a single element 0, i is n, l is an integer equal to the value at index n + 2 * q + 1 of data, r is an integer equal to the value at index n + 2 * q + 2 of data, x is an integer equal to the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1], v1 is a list containing all the indices i such that pf[i] is equal to pf[r], v2 is a list containing all the indices i such that pf[i] is equal to pf[l - 1], it1 is the index of the first occurrence of l in v1, it2 is the index of the last occurrence of r in v2**

The code block modifies the initial state by updating the values of `n`, `q`, `index`, `a`, `pf`, and `mp`. The value of `n` is updated to be the integer at index `index` of `data`, and the value of `q` is updated to be the integer at index `index + 1` of `data`. The value of `index` is incremented by 2. The list `a` is initialized with `n + 1` zeros, and the list `pf` is also initialized with `n + 1` zeros. The dictionary `mp` is updated to have a key-value pair where the key is 0 and the value is a list containing a single element 0. The values of `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` are not modified by the code block.
