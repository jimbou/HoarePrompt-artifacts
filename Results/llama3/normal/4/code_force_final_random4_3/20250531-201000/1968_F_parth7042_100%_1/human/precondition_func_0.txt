stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then a list of integers, and then multiple pairs of integers. The first integer is the number of elements in the list and the number of pairs of integers. The list contains non-negative integers less than 2^30. The pairs of integers are the queries, where the first integer in the pair is less than the second integer, both are non-negative, and the second integer is less than or equal to the length of the list.
