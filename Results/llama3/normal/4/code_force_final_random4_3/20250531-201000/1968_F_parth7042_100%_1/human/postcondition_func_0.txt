This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer, a list of integers, and multiple pairs of integers. It then processes each test case by calculating the XOR prefix sum of the list and storing the indices of equal prefix sums in a dictionary. For each pair of integers (query), it checks if there exists an index in the list such that the XOR prefix sum from the start of the list to that index is equal to the XOR prefix sum from the start of the list to the first integer in the pair, and the XOR prefix sum from the start of the list to the second integer in the pair is equal to the XOR prefix sum from the start of the list to the last index. If such an index exists, it appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. Finally, it prints the results list, containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query, indicating whether the specified condition is met.
