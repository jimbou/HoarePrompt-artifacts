The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_` and `q`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q`. If `_` is less than `q`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `q` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `q` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than q + 1, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop. If it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] < v2[it2]), results has one more 'YES' appended to it. Otherwise, results has one more 'NO' appended to it. index is n + 2 * q + n + 5, _ is 2, n is an integer and must be greater than 0, q must be greater than 2, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is equal to the value at index n + 2 * q + i of data and all other values are 0, pf is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is equal to the XOR of pf[i - 1] and a[i] and all other values are 0, mp is a dictionary with a key-value pair: 0 maps to a list containing a single element 0, and pf[i] maps to a list containing i, i is n, l is an integer equal to the value at index n + 2 * q + 1 of data, r is an integer equal to the value at index n + 2 * q + 2 of data, v1 is a list containing all the indices i such that pf[i] is equal to pf[r], v2 is a list containing all the indices i such that pf[i] is equal to pf[l - 1], it1 is the index of the first occurrence of l in v1, it2 is the index of the last occurrence of r in v2**
