Output State: **n is an integer equal to the value at index `index - (n - 1)` of `data` and must be greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer equal to the value at index `index - n` of `data` and must be greater than or equal to 0, index is `index + 2 * q`, a is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[i]` is the integer value at index `index - (n - i)` of `data` for `i` in range 1 to `n`, pf is a list of `n+1` integers where `pf[i]` is the XOR of `pf[i - 1]` and `a[i]` for `i` in range 1 to `n`, mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing a single element 0, and `pf[i]` maps to a list containing a single element `i` for `i` in range 1 to `n`, t is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than `q + 1 + 1`, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop, _ is `q - 1`, l is an integer equal to the value at index `n + 2 * q + 1` of `data`, r is an integer equal to the value at index `n + 2 * q + 2` of `data`, v1 is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[r]`, v2 is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[l - 1]`, it1 is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1`, it2 is the index of the last occurrence of `r` in `v2`, x is an integer equal to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and i is `n + 1`. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1` and `it2` is greater than or equal to 0 and `v1[it1]` is less than `v2[it2]`, then results contains an additional 'YES'. Otherwise, results contains an additional 'NO'.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop has executed `q` times, where `q` is the value at index `index - n` of `data`. The index has been incremented by `2 * q`. The list `a` contains `n+1` integers, where each integer is the value at the corresponding index in `data`. The list `pf` contains `n+1` integers, where each integer is the XOR of the previous integer and the corresponding integer in `a`. The dictionary `mp` maps each integer in `pf` to a list containing a single element, which is the index of that integer in `pf`. The variable `t` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than `q + 1 + 1`. The list `results` contains the string 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop. The variable `_` is `q - 1`. The variables `l`, `r`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`, `x`, and `i` have the same values as in the previous iterations. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1` and `it2` is greater than or equal to 0 and `v1[it1]` is less than `v2[it2]`, then `results` contains an additional 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` contains an additional 'NO'.
