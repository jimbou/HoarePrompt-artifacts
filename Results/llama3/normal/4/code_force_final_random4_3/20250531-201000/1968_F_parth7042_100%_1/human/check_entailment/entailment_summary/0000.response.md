Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the XOR prefix sum. The program calculates the XOR prefix sum for the entire array and stores the indices of equal prefix sums in a dictionary. For each query, it checks if there exists an index in the list such that the XOR prefix sum from the start of the list to that index is equal to the XOR prefix sum from the start of the list to the first integer in the pair, and the XOR prefix sum from the start of the list to the second integer in the pair is equal to the XOR prefix sum from the start of the list to the last index. If such an index exists, it appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. The program also handles the case where the XOR prefix sum is zero, in which case the subarray is always interesting.

Correctness: **True**
