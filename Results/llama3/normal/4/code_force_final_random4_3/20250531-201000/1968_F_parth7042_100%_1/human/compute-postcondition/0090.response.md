Output State: **n is an integer equal to the value at index `index - (n - 1)` of `data` and must be greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer equal to the value at index `index - n` of `data` and must be greater than 0, index is `index + 2`, a is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[i]` is the integer value at index `index - (n - i)` of `data` for `i` in range 1 to `n`, pf is a list of `n+1` integers where `pf[i]` is the XOR of `pf[i - 1]` and `a[i]` for `i` in range 1 to `n`, mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing a single element 0, and `pf[i]` maps to a list containing a single element `i` for `i` in range 1 to `n`, t is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than `q + 1 + 1`, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop, _ is 0, l is an integer equal to the value at index `n + 2 * q + 1` of `data`, r is an integer equal to the value at index `n + 2 * q + 2` of `data`, v1 is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[r]`, v2 is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[l - 1]`, it1 is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1`, it2 is the index of the last occurrence of `r` in `v2`, x is an integer equal to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and i is `n + 1`. If x is 0, results now contains an additional 'YES'.**

The code snippet executes the following operations:

1.  `v1 = mp[pf[r]]`: This line assigns to `v1` the list of indices `i` such that `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[r]`. This is done by looking up the value `pf[r]` in the dictionary `mp`, which maps prefix XOR values to their corresponding indices.

2.  `v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]`: This line assigns to `v2` the list of indices `i` such that `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[l - 1]`. This is done by looking up the value `pf[l - 1]` in the dictionary `mp`.

3.  `it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)`: This line finds the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1` using binary search. The `bisect_left` function returns the insertion point for `l` in `v1` to maintain sorted order.

4.  `it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`: This line finds the index of the last occurrence of `r` in `v2` using binary search. The `bisect_left` function returns the insertion point for `r` in `v2` to maintain sorted order, and then subtracts 1 to get the index of the last occurrence.

The final state includes all the variables from the initial state, with the following changes:

*   `v1` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[r]`.
*   `v2` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[l - 1]`.
*   `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1`.
*   `it2` is the index of the last occurrence of `r` in `v2`.

Note that the values of `x` and `results` are not modified by this code snippet.
