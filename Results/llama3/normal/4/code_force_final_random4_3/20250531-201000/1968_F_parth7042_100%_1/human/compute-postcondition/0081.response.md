Output State: **n is an integer equal to the value at index `index - 1` of `data` and must be greater than 1, q is an integer equal to the value at index `index` of `data`, index is `index + 1`, a is a list of `n+1` integers where a[1] is the integer value at index `index - 1` of `data` and a[2] is the integer value at index `index` of `data`, pf is a list of `n+1` integers where pf[1] is the XOR of pf[0] and a[1] and pf[2] is the XOR of pf[1] and a[2], mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing a single element 0, pf[1] maps to a list containing a single element 1, and pf[2] maps to a list containing a single element 2, t is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than `q + 1 + 1`, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop, _ is `q + 1`, l is an integer equal to the value at index `n + 2 * q + 1` of `data`, r is an integer equal to the value at index `n + 2 * q + 2` of `data`, v1 is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[r]`, v2 is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[l - 1]`, it1 is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1`, it2 is the index of the last occurrence of `r` in `v2`, x is an integer equal to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and i is 3.**

The code block modifies the values of `a`, `pf`, `mp`, and `index`. The value of `a` is updated by assigning the integer value at index `index` of `data` to `a[i]`. The value of `pf` is updated by assigning the XOR of `pf[i - 1]` and `a[i]` to `pf[i]`. The value of `mp` is updated by appending `i` to the list of values mapped to `pf[i]`. The value of `index` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `q`, `t`, `results`, `_`, `l`, `r`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`, and `x` remain unchanged.
