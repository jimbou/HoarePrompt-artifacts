Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than `q` + 1, `results` is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop and has one more 'NO' appended to it, `index` is `n` + 2 * `q` + `n` + 3, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n`+1 integers where the value at index `i` is equal to the value at index `n` + 2 * `q` + `i` of `data` and all other values are 0, `pf` is a list of `n`+1 integers where the value at index `i` is equal to the XOR of `pf[i - 1]` and `a[i]` and all other values are 0, `mp` is a dictionary with a key-value pair: 0 maps to a list containing a single element 0, and `pf[i]` maps to a list containing `i`, `i` is `n`, `l` is an integer equal to the value at index `n` + 2 * `q` + 1 of `data`, `r` is an integer equal to the value at index `n` + 2 * `q` + 2 of `data`, `x` is an integer equal to the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[r]`, `v2` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[l - 1]`, `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1`, `it2` is the index of the last occurrence of `r` in `v2`. Either `it1` is equal to or larger than the length of `v1`, or `it2` is less than 0, or `v1[it1]` is larger than or equal to `v2[it2]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but with one more 'NO' appended to the `results` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
