Postcondition: ***n is an integer equal to the value at index `index - (n - 1)` of `data` and must be greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer equal to the value at index `index - n` of `data` and must be greater than 0, index is `index + 2`, a is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[i]` is the integer value at index `index - (n - i)` of `data` for `i` in range 1 to `n`, pf is a list of `n+1` integers where `pf[i]` is the XOR of `pf[i - 1]` and `a[i]` for `i` in range 1 to `n`, mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing a single element 0, and `pf[i]` maps to a list containing a single element `i` for `i` in range 1 to `n`, t is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than `q + 1 + 1`, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop, _ is 0, l is an integer equal to the value at index `n + 2 * q + 1` of `data`, r is an integer equal to the value at index `n + 2 * q + 2` of `data`, v1 is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[r]`, v2 is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[l - 1]`, it1 is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1`, it2 is the index of the last occurrence of `r` in `v2`, x is an integer equal to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and i is `n + 1`. Either `it1` is greater than or equal to `len(v1)` or `it2` is less than 0 or `v1[it1]` is not less than `v2[it2]`.***
