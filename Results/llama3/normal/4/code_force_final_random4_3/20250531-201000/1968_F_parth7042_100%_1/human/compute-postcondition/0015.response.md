Output State: **t is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than 0, results is a list, index is n + 5, stdin contains multiple test cases with two inputs each: a list of integers and multiple pairs of integers, _ is 0, n is an integer and must be greater than 0, q must be greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the integer at index i + 2 of data for all i in range(1, n + 1), pf is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the XOR of the value at index i - 1 and the value at index i of a for all i in range(1, n + 1), mp is a dictionary with a key-value pair: the value at index i of pf maps to a list containing a single element i for all i in range(1, n + 1), i is n, l is an integer equal to the value at index n + 3 of data, r is an integer equal to the value at index n + 4 of data, x is an integer equal to the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1], v1 is a list containing a single element r, v2 is a list containing a single element l - 1, it1 is the index of the first occurrence of l in v1, it2 is the index of the last occurrence of r in v2.**
