Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the value at index `index - (n - 1)` of `data` and must be greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer equal to the value at index `index - n` of `data`, index is `index + n`, a is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[i]` is the integer value at index `index - (n - i)` of `data` for `i` in range 1 to `n`, pf is a list of `n+1` integers where `pf[i]` is the XOR of `pf[i - 1]` and `a[i]` for `i` in range 1 to `n`, mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing a single element 0, and `pf[i]` maps to a list containing a single element `i` for `i` in range 1 to `n`, t is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than `q + 1 + 1`, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop, _ is `q + 1`, l is an integer equal to the value at index `n + 2 * q + 1` of `data`, r is an integer equal to the value at index `n + 2 * q + 2` of `data`, v1 is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[r]`, v2 is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[l - 1]`, it1 is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1`, it2 is the index of the last occurrence of `r` in `v2`, x is an integer equal to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and i is `n + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[index])
    r = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp[pf[r]]
    v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
    it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer equal to the value at index `index - (n - 1)` of `data` and must be greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer equal to the value at index `index - n` of `data` and must be greater than 0, index is `index + 2`, a is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[i]` is the integer value at index `index - (n - i)` of `data` for `i` in range 1 to `n`, pf is a list of `n+1` integers where `pf[i]` is the XOR of `pf[i - 1]` and `a[i]` for `i` in range 1 to `n`, mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing a single element 0, and `pf[i]` maps to a list containing a single element `i` for `i` in range 1 to `n`, t is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than `q + 1 + 1`, results is a list containing the string 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop, _ is 0, l is an integer equal to the value at index `n + 2 * q + 1` of `data`, r is an integer equal to the value at index `n + 2 * q + 2` of `data`, v1 is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[r]`, v2 is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[l - 1]`, it1 is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1`, it2 is the index of the last occurrence of `r` in `v2`, x is an integer equal to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and i is `n + 1`. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, and `v1[it1]` is less than `v2[it2]`, then results contains an additional 'YES'. Otherwise, results contains an additional 'NO'.

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
