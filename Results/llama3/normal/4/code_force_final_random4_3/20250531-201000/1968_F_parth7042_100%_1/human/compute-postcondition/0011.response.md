Output State: **t is an integer equal to the first input from stdin and must be greater than 0, results is an empty list, index is n + 5, stdin contains multiple test cases with two inputs each: a list of integers and multiple pairs of integers, _ is 0, n is an integer and must be greater than 0, q must be greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the integer at index i + 2 of data for all i in range(1, n + 1), pf is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the XOR of the value at index i - 1 and the value at index i of a for all i in range(1, n + 1), mp is a dictionary with a key-value pair: the value at index i of pf maps to a list containing a single element i for all i in range(1, n + 1), i is n, l is an integer equal to the value at index n + 3 of data, r is an integer equal to the value at index n + 4 of data, x is an integer equal to the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1].**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `results`, `_`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, and `mp` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `index` is incremented by 2, so it becomes `n + 5`. The value of `l` is set to the integer at index `n + 3` of `data`, and the value of `r` is set to the integer at index `n + 4` of `data`. The value of `x` is calculated as the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`.
