Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), i is 0, x is an integer, l is a list of integers**

The code consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `x`. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `l`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The input is consumed by the two `input()` calls, so the input is now empty.
