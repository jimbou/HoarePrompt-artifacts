Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    x = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    for i in range(0, x):
        if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
            flag = True
            print(2)
            break
    else:
        print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), i is x, x is an integer, l is a list of integers. If l[l[i] - 1] is equal to i + 1 at any point during the loop execution, then flag is True and the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, the number 3 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is `x`, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `l` is a list of integers equal to the second input. If the element at index `l[i] - 1` in list `l` is equal to `i + 1` at any point during the loop, then `flag` is True and the number 2 has been printed. Otherwise, the number 3 has been printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is equal to `x`, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a list of integers equal to the second input. If the element at index `l[i] - 1` in list `l` is equal to `i + 1` at any point during the loop, then `flag` is True and the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, the number 3 is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
