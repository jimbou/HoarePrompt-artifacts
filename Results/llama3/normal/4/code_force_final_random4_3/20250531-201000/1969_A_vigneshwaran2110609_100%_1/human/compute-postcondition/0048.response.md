Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `x` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `flag` is either True or False (depending on the previous iteration), stdin contains no inputs, and the element at index `l[i] - 1` in list `l` is equal to `i + 1`.**
