Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `l` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `flag` is True**

In this output state, the value of `flag` has been updated to `True`, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is still 2, `x` is still an integer greater than or equal to 2, and `l` is still a list of integers equal to the second input.
