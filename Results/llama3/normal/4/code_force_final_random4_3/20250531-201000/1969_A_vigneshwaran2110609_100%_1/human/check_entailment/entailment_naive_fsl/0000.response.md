Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input is:

3
4
2 3 4 1

The program will print 3, but the correct answer is 3. However, if the input is:

3
4
2 1 4 3

The program will print 3, but the correct answer is 4. The program only checks for pairs of friends where both friends are each other's best friends, but it does not consider cases where there are more than two friends in a cycle.

The program should be modified to handle all possible cases, not just the cases where two friends are each other's best friends.
