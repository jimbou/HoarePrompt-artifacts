Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `x` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `flag` is True**

In this output state, the value of `flag` has been updated to True, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The range of `n` and the value of `i` are still the same, and `x` is still greater than 2. The list `l` also remains unchanged.
