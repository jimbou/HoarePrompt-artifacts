Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints output based on the conditions met in each test case. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The function iterates over the test cases, reads the number of integers and the integers themselves, and checks if any integer at a specific index matches the index plus one. If a match is found, it prints 2; otherwise, it prints 3. The function's purpose is to evaluate the given test cases and provide output based on the specified conditions.**
