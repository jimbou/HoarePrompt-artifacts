The code sets the value of `flag` to True. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `x` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `flag` is True.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `x` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `flag` is True**
