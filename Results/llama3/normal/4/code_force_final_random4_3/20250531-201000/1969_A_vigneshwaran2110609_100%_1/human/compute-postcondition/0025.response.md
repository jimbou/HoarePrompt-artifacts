According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `x + 1`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 and `x` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers equal to the second input**
