Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It iterates through the list of friends and checks if the best friend of a friend is the same as the current friend. If it finds such a pair, it prints 2, indicating that only 2 invitations are needed for at least 2 friends to come to the party. If it doesn't find such a pair, it prints 3, indicating that at least 3 invitations are needed.

The program correctly handles the case where a friend's best friend is the same as the current friend, which is a special case in the problem description. It also correctly handles the case where no such pair is found, in which case at least 3 invitations are needed.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
