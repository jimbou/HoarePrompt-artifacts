Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `x` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers equal to the second input. If `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `i + 1`, then `flag` is set to True, the number 2 is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
