Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers equal to the second input. If the value at index `l[i] - 1` in list `l` is equal to `i + 1`, then `flag` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
