The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that the input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 5000) followed by `t` test cases, and each test case starts with an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50), the value of `n` will be one of these test case integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i).**
