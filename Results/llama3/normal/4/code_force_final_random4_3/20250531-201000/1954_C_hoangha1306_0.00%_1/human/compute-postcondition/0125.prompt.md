Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 2, stdin contains 2t - 6 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, a is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, b is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, kq1 is an empty string, kq2 is an empty string, vt is 0, i is equal to the length of a, x is the minimum of the integer at index i-1 of a and b, y is the maximum of the integer at index i-1 of a and b
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `q` is 2, stdin contains 2t - 6 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, `a` is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 character, `b` is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is less than the length of `a`, `x` is the minimum of the integer at index i-1 of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer at index i-1 of `a` and `b`. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are set to the character at index `i` of `a`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `vt` is set to 1, and `kq1` and `kq2` are set based on the comparison of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `vt` is not 0, then `kq1` is set to the maximum of the integer at index `i` of `a` and `b`, and `kq2` is set to the minimum of the integer at index `i` of `a` and `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 2, stdin contains 2t - 6 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, a is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 character, b is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, i is less than the length of a and is incremented by 1, x is the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b, y is the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are set to the character at index i of a plus the original value of kq1 and kq2 respectively. If a[i] is not equal to b[i], then vt is set to 1, and kq1 and kq2 are set based on the comparison of a[i] and b[i]. If vt is not 0, then kq1 is set to the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b, and kq2 is set to the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b. If a[i] > b[i], then kq1 is the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b plus the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b, and kq2 is the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b plus the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b. Otherwise, kq1 is the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b followed by the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b, and kq2 is the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b followed by the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b. If vt is 0, then kq1 is the string kq1 with the character y appended to it, and kq2 is the string kq2 with the character x appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 2, stdin contains 2t - 6 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, a is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 characters, b is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, i is less than the length of a and is incremented by 1, x is the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b, y is the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are set to the character at index i of a plus the original value of kq1 and kq2 respectively. If a[i] is not equal to b[i], then vt is set to 1, and kq1 and kq2 are updated based on the comparison of a[i] and b[i]. If vt is not 0, then kq1 is set to the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b, and kq2 is set to the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b. If a[i] > b[i], then kq1 is the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b plus the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b, and kq2 is the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b plus the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b. Otherwise, kq1 is the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b followed by the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b, and kq2 is the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b followed by the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b. If vt is 0, then kq1 is the string kq1 with the character y appended to it, and kq2 is the string kq2 with the character x appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
