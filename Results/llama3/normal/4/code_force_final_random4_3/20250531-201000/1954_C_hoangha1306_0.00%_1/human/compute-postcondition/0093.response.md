Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `q` is 2, stdin contains 2t - 6 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, `a` is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 character, `b` is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0, `i` is less than the length of `a`, `x` is the minimum of the integer at index i of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer at index i of `a` and `b`, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`.**

In this output state, the values of `x` and `y` have been updated to be the minimum and maximum of the integer at index `i` of `a` and `b`, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, which means that the minimum and maximum values are not the same.
