Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 2, stdin contains 2t - 6 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, a is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 character, b is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, i is less than the length of a and is incremented by 1, x is the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b, y is the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b. If vt is 0, then kq1 and kq2 are set based on the comparison of a[i] and b[i]. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are set to the character at index i of a. If a[i] is not equal to b[i], then vt is set to 1, and kq1 and kq2 are set based on the comparison of a[i] and b[i]. If vt is not 0, then kq1 is set to the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b, and kq2 is set to the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b. If a[i] > b[i], then kq1 is the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b plus the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b, and kq2 is the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b plus the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b. Otherwise, kq1 is the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b followed by the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b, and kq2 is the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b followed by the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b. If vt is 0, then kq1 is the string kq1 with the character y appended to it, and kq2 is the string kq2 with the character x appended to it.***
