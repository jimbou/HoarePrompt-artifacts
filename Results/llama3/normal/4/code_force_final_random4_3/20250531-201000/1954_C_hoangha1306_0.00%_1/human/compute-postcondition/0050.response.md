Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `q` is 1, stdin contains 2t - 4 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, `a` is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9 and must have at least 1 character, `b` is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` is the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b, `y` is the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b, and the character at index i of `a` is not equal to the character at index i of `b`.**

In this output state, the values of `x` and `y` have been updated to be the minimum and maximum of the integer at index `i` of `a` and `b`, respectively. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Note that `i` is still 0, so `x` and `y` are now the minimum and maximum of the first characters of `a` and `b`.
