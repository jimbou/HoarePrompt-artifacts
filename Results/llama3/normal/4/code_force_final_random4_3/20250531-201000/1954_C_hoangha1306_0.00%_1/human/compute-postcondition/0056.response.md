Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 1, stdin contains 2t - 4 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, a is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9 and must have at least 1 character, b is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, kq1 is a string consisting of the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b, kq2 is a string consisting of the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b, vt is 1, i is 0, x is the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b, and y is the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b, and the character at index i of a is not equal to the character at index i of b, and the character at index i of a is less than or equal to the character at index i of b.**

In this output state, the only changes made by the code are to the variables kq1 and kq2. The variable kq1 now holds the string representation of the maximum of the integer at index i of strings a and b, while kq2 holds the string representation of the minimum of the integer at index i of strings a and b. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
