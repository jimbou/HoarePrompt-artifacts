Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 2, stdin contains 2t - 6 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, a is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 character, b is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, i is less than the length of a and is incremented by 1, x is the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b, y is the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b, kq1 is the character at index i of a plus the original value of kq1, kq2 is the character at index i of a plus the original value of kq2, vt is 0 or 1 depending on whether a[i] is equal to b[i].**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `x`, `y`, and `vt` remain unchanged from the initial state. The only changes are to `kq1` and `kq2`, which are incremented by the character at index `i` of `a`. The value of `kq1` and `kq2` now depends on the original value of `kq1` and `kq2` and the character at index `i` of `a`. The value of `vt` is still 0 or 1 depending on whether `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`.
