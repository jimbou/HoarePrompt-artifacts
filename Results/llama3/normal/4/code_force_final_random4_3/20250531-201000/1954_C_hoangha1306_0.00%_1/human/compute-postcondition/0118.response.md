Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `q` is 2, stdin contains 2t - 6 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, `a` is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is less than the length of `a` and is incremented by 1, `x` is the minimum of the integer at index `i` of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer at index `i` of `a` and `b`, `kq1` and `kq2` are set based on the comparison of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `vt` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that `vt` is now set to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
