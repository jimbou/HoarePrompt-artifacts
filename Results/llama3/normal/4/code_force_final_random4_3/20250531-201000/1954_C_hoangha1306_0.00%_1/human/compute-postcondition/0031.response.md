Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `q` is 0, stdin contains 2t - 2 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, `a` is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 3 characters, `b` is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 2, `x` is the minimum of the 2nd character of `a` and the 2nd character of `b`, `y` is the maximum of the 2nd character of `a` and the 2nd character of `b`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `q`, stdin, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The code only affects the values of `x` and `y`, which are assigned the minimum and maximum of the 2nd character of `a` and the 2nd character of `b`, respectively.
