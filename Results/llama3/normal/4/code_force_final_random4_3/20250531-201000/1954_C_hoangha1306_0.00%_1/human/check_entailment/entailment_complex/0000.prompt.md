Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by 2t strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length.
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        kq1 = ''
        
        kq2 = ''
        
        vt = 0
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
                kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
                continue
            else:
                x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
                if vt == 0:
                    vt = 1
                    if a[i] > b[i]:
                        kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                        kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
                    else:
                        kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                        kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
                else:
                    kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                    kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        
        print(kq1)
        
        print(kq2)
        
    #State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is equal to t, stdin is empty, a is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, b is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, i is equal to the length of a, kq1 is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, kq2 is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, vt is 1, x is the minimum of the integer at index i-1 of a and b, y is the maximum of the integer at index i-1 of a and b, kq1 is printed, and kq2 is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by 2t strings, each consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length. It then processes these strings in pairs, comparing corresponding characters and generating two new strings (kq1 and kq2) based on the comparison. The function prints these two strings for each pair of input strings. The function does not return any value, and its purpose is to generate and print the processed strings according to the specified rules.
