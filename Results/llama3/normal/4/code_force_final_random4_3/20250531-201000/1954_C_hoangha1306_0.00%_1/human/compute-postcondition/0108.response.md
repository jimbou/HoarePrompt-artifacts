Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `q` is 2, stdin contains 2t - 6 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, `a` is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 character, `b` is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is less than the length of `a` and is incremented by 1, `x` is the minimum of the integer at index i of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer at index i of `a` and `b`, `vt` is 1, `kq1` is the maximum of the integer at index i of `a` and `b`, and `kq2` is the minimum of the integer at index i of `a` and `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `vt` is set to 1, and since `vt` is not 0, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the comparison of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. `kq1` is set to the maximum of the integer at index `i` of `a` and `b`, and `kq2` is set to the minimum of the integer at index `i` of `a` and `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
