The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by 2t strings. After accepting the integer `t`, the stdin now contains 2t strings. The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The strings in the stdin have the same length and consist of digits from 1 to 9.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains 2t strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length.**
