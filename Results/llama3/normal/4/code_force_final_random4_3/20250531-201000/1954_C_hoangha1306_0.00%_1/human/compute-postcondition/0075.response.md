Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `q` is 1, stdin contains 2t - 4 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, `a` is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9 and must have at least 3 characters, `b` is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 2, `x` is the minimum of the integer at index i of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer at index i of `a` and `b`. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are strings consisting of two digits from 1 to 9. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `kq1` is a string consisting of a single digit from 1 to 9 followed by the maximum of the integer at index i of `a` and `b`, and `kq2` is a string consisting of a single digit from 1 to 9 followed by the minimum of the integer at index i of `a` and `b`, and `vt` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `vt` has been changed to 1. The values of the other variables remain the same. The strings `kq1` and `kq2` are updated according to the new value of `vt`. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are still strings consisting of two digits from 1 to 9. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are now strings consisting of a single digit from 1 to 9 followed by the maximum or minimum of the integer at index i of `a` and `b`, respectively.
