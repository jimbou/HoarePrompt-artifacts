Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `q` is 0, stdin contains 2t - 2 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, `a` is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 3 characters, `b` is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 2, `x` is the minimum of the 2nd character of `a` and the 2nd character of `b`, `y` is the maximum of the 2nd character of `a` and the 2nd character of `b`, `vt` is 1.**

In this output state, a new variable `vt` has been introduced and assigned the value 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains 2t - 2 strings, each consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length. The properties of `a` and `b` as strings consisting of digits from 1 to 9 are also preserved. The values of `x` and `y` are still determined by the 2nd characters of `a` and `b`.
