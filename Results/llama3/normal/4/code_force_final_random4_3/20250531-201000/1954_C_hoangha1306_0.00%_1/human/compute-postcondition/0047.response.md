Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `q` is 1, stdin contains 2t - 4 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, `a` is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9 and must have at least 1 character, `b` is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `x` is the minimum of the integer at index i-1 of `a` and `b`, the current value of `y` is the maximum of the integer at index i-1 of `a` and `b`. The character at index `i` of `a` is equal to the character at index `i` of `b`.**
