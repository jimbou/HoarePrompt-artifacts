Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `q` is 0, stdin contains 2t - 2 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, `a` is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings consisting of the maximum and minimum of the integer at index 2 of `a` and `b`, `vt` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the minimum of the integer at index 2 of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the maximum of the integer at index 2 of `a` and `b`. If the character at index 2 of `a` is greater than the character at index 2 of `b`, then `kq1` is the maximum followed by the minimum, and `kq2` is the minimum followed by the maximum. Otherwise, `kq1` and `kq2` are both the maximum followed by the maximum, and the minimum followed by the minimum, respectively.**
