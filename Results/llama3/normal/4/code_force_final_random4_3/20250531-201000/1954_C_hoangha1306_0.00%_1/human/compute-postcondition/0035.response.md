Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 0, stdin contains 2t - 2 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, a is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 3 characters, b is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, i is 2, x is the minimum of the 2nd character of a and the 2nd character of b, y is the maximum of the 2nd character of a and the 2nd character of b, vt is 1. If a[i] > b[i], then kq1 is a string consisting of its original value and the value of x, and kq2 is a string consisting of its original value and the value of y. Otherwise, kq1 is kq1 + str(y), and kq2 is kq2 + str(x).**
