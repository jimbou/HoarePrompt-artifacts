Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 2, stdin contains 2t - 6 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, a is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 character, b is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, i is less than the length of a, x is the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b, y is the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b, and a[i] is not equal to b[i]. If vt is 0, then vt is 1, and kq1 and kq2 are set based on the comparison of a[i] and b[i]. If vt is not 0, then kq1 is a string consisting of the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b, and kq2 is a string consisting of the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b.**
