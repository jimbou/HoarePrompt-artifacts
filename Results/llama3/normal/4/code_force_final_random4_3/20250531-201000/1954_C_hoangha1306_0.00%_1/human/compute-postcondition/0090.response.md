Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `q` is 2, stdin contains 2t - 6 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, `a` is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 character, `b` is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0, `i` is less than the length of `a`, `x` is the minimum of the integer at index i-1 of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer at index i-1 of `a` and `b`. The current value of `a` at index `i` is equal to the current value of `b` at index `i`***
