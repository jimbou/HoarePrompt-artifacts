Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `q` is 0, `stdin` contains 2t - 2 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, `a` is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 character, `b` is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` is the minimum of the integer at index `i` of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer at index `i` of `a` and `b`, and the character at index `i` of `a` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `q`, `stdin`, `a`, `b`, `kq1`, `kq2`, `vt`, and `i` remain the same. Two new variables `x` and `y` are introduced, where `x` is the smaller digit between the character at index `i` of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the larger digit between the character at index `i` of `a` and `b`. The condition that the character at index `i` of `a` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `b` still holds.
