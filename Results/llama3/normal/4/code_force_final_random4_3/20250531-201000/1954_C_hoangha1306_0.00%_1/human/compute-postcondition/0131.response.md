Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by 2t strings, each consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length. It then processes these strings in pairs, comparing corresponding characters and generating two new strings (kq1 and kq2) based on the comparison. The function prints these two strings for each pair of input strings. The function does not return any value, and its purpose is to generate and print the processed strings according to the specified rules.**
