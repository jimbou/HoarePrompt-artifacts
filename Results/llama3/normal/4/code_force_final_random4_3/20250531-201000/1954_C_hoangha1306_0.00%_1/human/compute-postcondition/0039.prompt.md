Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 0, stdin contains 2t - 2 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, a is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, b is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, kq1 is an empty string, kq2 is an empty string, vt is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 0, stdin contains 2t - 2 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, a is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 character, b is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9. If the character at index i of a is equal to the character at index i of b, then kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of 1 character equal to the character at index i of a (or b). Otherwise, kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of a single digit from 1 to 9, vt is either 0 or 1, i is 0, x is the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b, y is the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b, and either the character at index i of a is greater than the character at index i of b or the character at index i of a is less than or equal to the character at index i of b. If vt is 0, then kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of a single digit from 1 to 9. If vt is not 0, then kq1 is a string consisting of the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b, and kq2 is a string consisting of the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 0, stdin contains 2t - 2 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, a is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 characters, b is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of 2 characters equal to the character at index 0 of a followed by the character at index 1 of a. If a[i] is not equal to b[i], then i is 1, x is the minimum of the integer at index 2 of a and b, and y is the maximum of the integer at index 2 of a and b. If vt is 0, then kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of a single digit from 1 to 9. If vt is not 0, then kq1 is a string consisting of the maximum of the integer at index 2 of a and b, and kq2 is a string consisting of the minimum of the integer at index 2 of a and b. Either the character at index 2 of a is greater than the character at index 2 of b or the character at index 2 of a is less than or equal to the character at index 2 of b.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 0, stdin contains 2t - 2 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, a is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 3 characters, b is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, i is 2. If a[i] equals b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of digits from 1 to 9, both having one more digit than before. Otherwise, x is the minimum of the 2nd character of a and the 2nd character of b, y is the maximum of the 2nd character of a and the 2nd character of b. If vt is 1, then if a[i] > b[i], kq1 is a string consisting of its original value and the value of x, and kq2 is a string consisting of its original value and the value of y. Otherwise, kq1 is kq1 + str(y), and kq2 is kq2 + str(x). If vt is not 1, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of y, kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of x.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
