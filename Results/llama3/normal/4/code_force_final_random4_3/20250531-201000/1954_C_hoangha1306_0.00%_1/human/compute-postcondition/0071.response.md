Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 1, stdin contains 2t - 4 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, a is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9 and must have at least 2 characters, b is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, i is 1, x is the minimum of the integer at index i-1 of a and b, y is the maximum of the integer at index i-1 of a and b. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of two digits from 1 to 9. If a[i] is not equal to b[i], then if vt is 0, kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of a single digit from 1 to 9, and if a[i] is greater than b[i], then kq1 is a string consisting of the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b, followed by the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b, and kq2 is a string consisting of the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b, followed by the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b. Otherwise, kq1 is extended by the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b, and kq2 is extended by the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b. If vt is not 0, then kq1 is a string consisting of a single digit from 1 to 9 followed by the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b, and kq2 is a string consisting of a single digit from 1 to 9 followed by the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b.***
