Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 0, stdin contains 2t - 2 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, a is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 3 characters, b is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, i is 2. If a[i] equals b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of digits from 1 to 9, both having one more digit than before. Otherwise, x is the minimum of the 2nd character of a and the 2nd character of b, y is the maximum of the 2nd character of a and the 2nd character of b. If vt is 1, then if a[i] > b[i], kq1 is a string consisting of its original value and the value of x, and kq2 is a string consisting of its original value and the value of y. Otherwise, kq1 is kq1 + str(y), and kq2 is kq2 + str(x). If vt is not 1, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of y, kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of x.**
