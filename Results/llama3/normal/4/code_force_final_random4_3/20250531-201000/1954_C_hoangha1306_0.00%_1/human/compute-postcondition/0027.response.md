Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 0, stdin contains 2t - 2 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, a is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 characters, b is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, i is 1, x is the minimum of the integer at index 2 of a and b, and y is the maximum of the integer at index 2 of a and b. If vt is 0, then kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of a single digit from 1 to 9. If vt is not 0, then kq1 is a string consisting of the maximum of the integer at index 2 of a and b, and kq2 is a string consisting of the minimum of the integer at index 2 of a and b. If vt is 0, then kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of 2 characters, the first character is equal to the character at index 0 of a (or b), and the second character is equal to the maximum and minimum of the integer at index 2 of a and b, respectively. If vt is not 0, then kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of the maximum and minimum of the integer at index 2 of a and b, respectively. Either the character at index 2 of a is greater than the character at index 2 of b or the character at index 2 of a is less than or equal to the character at index 2 of b.***
