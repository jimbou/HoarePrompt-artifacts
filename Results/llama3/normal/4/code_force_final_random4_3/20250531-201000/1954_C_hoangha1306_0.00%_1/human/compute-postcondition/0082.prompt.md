Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 1, stdin contains 2t - 4 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, a is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, b is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, kq1 is an empty string, kq2 is an empty string, vt is 0, i is equal to the length of a, x is the minimum of the integer at index i-1 of a and b, y is the maximum of the integer at index i-1 of a and b
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 1, stdin contains 2t - 4 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, a is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9 and must have at least 1 character, b is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of a single digit from 1 to 9, vt is either 0 or 1, i is 0, x is the minimum of the integer at index i-1 of a and b, y is the maximum of the integer at index i-1 of a and b. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of the character at index i of a. If a[i] is not equal to b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of a single digit from 1 to 9, and vt is either 0 or 1. If vt is 0, then kq1 is a string consisting of a single digit from 1 to 9 if the character at index i of a is greater than the character at index i of b, otherwise kq1 is a string consisting of the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b, and kq2 is a string consisting of the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b. If vt is not 0, then kq1 is a string consisting of the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b, and kq2 is a string consisting of the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 1, stdin contains 2t - 4 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, a is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9 and must have at least 2 characters, b is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, i is 1, x is the minimum of the integer at index i-1 of a and b, y is the maximum of the integer at index i-1 of a and b. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of two digits from 1 to 9. If a[i] is not equal to b[i], then if vt is 0, kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of a single digit from 1 to 9, and if a[i] is greater than b[i], then kq1 is a string consisting of the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b, followed by the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b, and kq2 is a string consisting of the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b, followed by the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b. Otherwise, kq1 is extended by the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b, and kq2 is extended by the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b. If vt is not 0, then kq1 is a string consisting of a single digit from 1 to 9 followed by the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b, and kq2 is a string consisting of a single digit from 1 to 9 followed by the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 1, stdin contains 2t - 4 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, a is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9 and must have at least 3 characters, b is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, i is 2, x is the minimum of the integer at index i-1 of a and b, y is the maximum of the integer at index i-1 of a and b. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of two digits from 1 to 9, followed by the digit at index i of a. If a[i] is not equal to b[i], then if vt is 0, kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of a single digit from 1 to 9, and if a[i] is greater than b[i], then kq1 is a string consisting of the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b, followed by the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b, and kq2 is a string consisting of the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b, followed by the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b. Otherwise, kq1 is extended by the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b, and kq2 is extended by the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b. If vt is not 0, then kq1 is a string consisting of a single digit from 1 to 9 followed by the maximum of the integer at index i of a and b, and kq2 is a string consisting of a single digit from 1 to 9 followed by the minimum of the integer at index i of a and b. If a[i] is greater than b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of two digits from 1 to 9 followed by y and x respectively. If a[i] is less than or equal to b[i], then kq1 is a string consisting of two digits from 1 to 9 followed by y, and kq2 is a string consisting of two digits from 1 to 9 followed by x.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
