Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `q` is 0, stdin contains 2t - 2 strings, each string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, with all strings having the same length, `a` is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a string consisting of digits from 1 to 9, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings consisting of 1 character equal to the character at index 0 of `a` (or `b`), `vt` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the minimum of the integer at index 2 of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer at index 2 of `a` and `b`, and either the character at index 2 of `a` is greater than the character at index 2 of `b` or the character at index 2 of `a` is less than or equal to the character at index 2 of `b`. If `vt` is 0, then `kq1` and `kq2` are strings consisting of a single digit from 1 to 9. If `vt` is not 0, then `kq1` is a string consisting of the maximum of the integer at index 2 of `a` and `b`, and `kq2` is a string consisting of the minimum of the integer at index 2 of `a` and `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the values of `x` and `y` have been updated to be the minimum and maximum of the integer at index 2 of `a` and `b`, respectively. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
