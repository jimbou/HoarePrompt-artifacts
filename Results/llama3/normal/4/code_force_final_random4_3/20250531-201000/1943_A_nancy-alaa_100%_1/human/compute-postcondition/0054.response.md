Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()` or `mpp[i]` is not 1 or `first` is False, then the value of `i` which is 0 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `first` is True and the value of `i` which is 0 has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[i]` is 1, then `first` is True and the value of `i` which is 0 has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
