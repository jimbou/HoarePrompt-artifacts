Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs. If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `first` is True and `mpp[i]` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we continue with the next iteration of the loop.***
