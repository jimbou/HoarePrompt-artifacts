Output: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `stdin` contains input greater than `n`, `i` is 1. If the current value of `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp` and the count of `i` in `mpp` is 1, then `first` is True. Otherwise, the program continues to execute, and the value of `i` which is 1 is being printed**
