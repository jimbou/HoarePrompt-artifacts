Output State: **`n` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and the value of `i` which is 2 has been returned.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of `i` is still 2. However, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and returns the value of `i`, which is 2.
