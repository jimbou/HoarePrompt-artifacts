Output State: **n is an integer, i is n, arr is a list of integers, mpp is a dictionary where keys are elements from arr and values are their respective counts, first is False, stdin contains no input**.

In this final state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer value from the input. The value of `i` remains the same as `n`. The list `arr` now contains the integers from the input. The dictionary `mpp` maps each element from `arr` to its count. The variable `first` has been set to `False`. Stdin is now empty, as all inputs have been consumed.
