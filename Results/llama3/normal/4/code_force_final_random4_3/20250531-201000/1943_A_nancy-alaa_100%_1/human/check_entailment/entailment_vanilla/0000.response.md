Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to another array `c` (for Alice) or simply deleting them from `a` (for Bob). The goal is to maximize the MEX (minimum excludant) of array `c` for Alice, while Bob tries to minimize it.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `arr`.

3. It creates a frequency map `mpp` of the elements in the array using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module.

4. It then iterates over the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive) to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array or is present only once and has not been encountered before.

5. If it finds such an integer, it prints it as the final score for the current test case and breaks out of the loop.

6. If no such integer is found, it means that all integers from 0 to `n` are present in the array at least twice, so the final score is `n + 1`, but this case is not explicitly handled in the program.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. However, it does not handle the case where all integers from 0 to `n` are present in the array at least twice, which would result in a final score of `n + 1`. But according to the problem constraints, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, so this case is not possible.

Correctness: **True**
