Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `stdin` contains input greater than `n`, `i` is printed, where `i` is not a key in `mpp`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is still not a key in `mpp` and has been printed. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
