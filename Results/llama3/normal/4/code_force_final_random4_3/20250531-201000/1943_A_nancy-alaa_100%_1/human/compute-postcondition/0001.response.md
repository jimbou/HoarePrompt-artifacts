Output State: **n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, mpp is a dictionary where keys are elements from arr and values are their respective counts, first is False, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer that was read from the first input in stdin. The list `arr` contains integers that were read from the second input in stdin, which is a space-separated list of integers. The dictionary `mpp` maps each unique element in `arr` to its count. The variable `first` is set to `False`. Stdin now contains at least one test case minus the two inputs that were read.
