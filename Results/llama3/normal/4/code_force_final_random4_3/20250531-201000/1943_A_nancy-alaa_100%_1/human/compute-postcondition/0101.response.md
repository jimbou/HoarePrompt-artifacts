Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `stdin` contains input greater than `n`, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 1. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the `break` statement.
