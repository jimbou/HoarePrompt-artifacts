Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts. The current value of `i` is in `mpp.keys()`. The current value of `first` is True. The current value of `mpp[i]` is 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first` and `mpp[i]` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains at least one test case minus two inputs.
