This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. It then finds and prints the smallest positive integer that is either missing from the list or appears only once. If no such integer exists, it prints the smallest positive integer greater than n. The function processes all test cases and does not return any value.
