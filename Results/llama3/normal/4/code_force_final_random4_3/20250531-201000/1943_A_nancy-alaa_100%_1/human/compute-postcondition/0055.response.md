The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`n` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()` or `mpp[i]` is not 1 or `first` is False, then the value of `i` which is 1 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `first` is True and the value of `i` which is 1 has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[i]` is 1, then `first` is True and the value of `i` which is 1 has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
