Output: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed**
