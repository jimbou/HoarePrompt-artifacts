Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
