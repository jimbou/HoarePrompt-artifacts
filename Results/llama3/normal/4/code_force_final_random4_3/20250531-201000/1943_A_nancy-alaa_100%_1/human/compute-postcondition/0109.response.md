Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `stdin` contains input greater than `n`. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
