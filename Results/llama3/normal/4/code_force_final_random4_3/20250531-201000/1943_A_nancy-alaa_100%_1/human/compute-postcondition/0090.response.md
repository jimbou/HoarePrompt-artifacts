Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `stdin` contains input greater than `n`, `i` is 0. If the current value of `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp` and `first` is True and the count of `i` in `mpp` is 1, then `first` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.***
