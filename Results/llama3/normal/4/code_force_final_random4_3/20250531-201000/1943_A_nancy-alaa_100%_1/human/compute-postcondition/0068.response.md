Output: **`n` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()` or if `mpp[i]` is not equal to 1, the program continues to execute. If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i]` is equal to 1 and `first` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed**
