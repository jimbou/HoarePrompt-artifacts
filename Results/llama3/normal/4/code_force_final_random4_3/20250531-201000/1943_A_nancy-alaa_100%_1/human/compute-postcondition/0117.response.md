Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, arr is a list of integers, mpp is a dictionary where keys are elements from arr and values are their respective counts, stdin contains no input, i is n, first is True if there exists an element in arr that appears only once, False otherwise.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` will still be an integer greater than or equal to 0, the list `arr` will still contain integers, the dictionary `mpp` will still have elements from `arr` as keys and their respective counts as values, the standard input `stdin` will be empty (i.e., no more input will be available), the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, and the variable `first` will be `True` if there exists an element in `arr` that appears only once, and `False` otherwise.
