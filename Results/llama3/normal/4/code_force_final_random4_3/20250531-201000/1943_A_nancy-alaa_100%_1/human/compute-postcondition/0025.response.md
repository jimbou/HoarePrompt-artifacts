Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()` or `mpp[i]` is not 1 or `first` is False, we continue with the next iteration of the loop or if statement. If `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, the value of `i` which is 1 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code does not change the values of any variables. The value of `first` is still True. The values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, and `mpp` remain the same. The stdin still contains at least one test case minus two inputs. The conditions for continuing with the next iteration of the loop or if statement or breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement remain the same.
