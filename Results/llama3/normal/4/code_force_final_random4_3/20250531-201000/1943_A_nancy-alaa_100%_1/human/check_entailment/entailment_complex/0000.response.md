Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize the score in the game. The program uses a Counter to count the occurrences of each number in the array, and then iterates through the numbers from 0 to n to find the smallest number that is either missing from the array or appears only once. This is the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score, as she wants to include all numbers that appear more than once in the array, and Bob wants to remove all numbers that appear only once.

The program also correctly handles the case where no such number exists, in which case it prints the smallest positive integer greater than n.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
