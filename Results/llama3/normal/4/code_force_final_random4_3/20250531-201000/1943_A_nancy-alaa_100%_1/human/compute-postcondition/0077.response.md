Output State: **`n` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True if there exists an element in `arr` that appears only once, False otherwise.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the loop has iterated over the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive). The variable `i` has taken on the value of `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The list `arr` and dictionary `mpp` remain unchanged, as they are not modified within the loop. The variable `first` is set to True if there exists an element in `arr` that appears only once, and False otherwise. This is because the loop checks for the existence of such an element and sets `first` accordingly.
