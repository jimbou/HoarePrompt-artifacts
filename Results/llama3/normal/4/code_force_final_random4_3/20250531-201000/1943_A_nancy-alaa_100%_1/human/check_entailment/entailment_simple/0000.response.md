Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. It uses a `Counter` object from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each integer in the list. This is an efficient way to count the occurrences of each integer.

3. The program then iterates over the range of integers from 0 to `n` (inclusive). For each integer `i`, it checks if `i` is not present in the `Counter` object `mpp`. If `i` is not present, it means that `i` is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array, so it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.

4. If `i` is present in `mpp`, the program checks if the count of `i` is 1 and if `first` is `True`. If both conditions are true, it means that `i` is the smallest integer that appears only once in the array, and Alice has already picked an integer that appears only once. In this case, the program prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.

5. If the count of `i` is 1 but `first` is `False`, the program sets `first` to `True`. This is because Alice can pick the integer `i` to maximize her score.

6. If the count of `i` is greater than 1, the program simply moves on to the next integer.

7. The program correctly handles the case where all integers from 0 to `n` are present in the array, in which case it prints `n`.

Overall, the program correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize her score, and it handles all possible cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
