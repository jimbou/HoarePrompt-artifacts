Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is False, `stdin` contains no input. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, the value of `i` which is 0 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
