Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mpp = Counter(arr)
    first = False
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i not in mpp.keys():
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1:
            first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs. If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `first` is True and `mpp[i]` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we continue with the next iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True if there exists an element in `arr` that appears only once, False otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, arr is a list of integers, mpp is a dictionary where keys are elements from arr and values are their respective counts, stdin contains input greater than n, i is n.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
