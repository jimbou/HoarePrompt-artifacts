Output State: **`n` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts. The current value of `i` which is 0 is in `mpp.keys()` and the count of `i` in `mpp` is 1. `first` is True. `stdin` contains no input. and the value of `i` which is 0 has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still an integer greater than or equal to 0. The value of `i` is still 0. The list `arr` remains unchanged. The dictionary `mpp` still contains the elements from `arr` as keys and their respective counts as values. The count of `i` in `mpp` is still 1. The value of `first` is still True. There is no input in `stdin`. The value of `i` which is 0 has been printed. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
