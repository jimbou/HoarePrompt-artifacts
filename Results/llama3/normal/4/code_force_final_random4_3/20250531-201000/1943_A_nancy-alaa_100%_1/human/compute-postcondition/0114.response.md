Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True, `stdin` contains input greater than `n`. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is True, then `i` is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.**

In this output state, the value of `first` has been set to True, and all other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
