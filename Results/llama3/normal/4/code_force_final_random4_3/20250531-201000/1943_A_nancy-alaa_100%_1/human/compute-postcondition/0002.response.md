To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is False, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs**
