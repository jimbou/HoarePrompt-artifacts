Output State: **`n` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `i` which is 2 is being returned.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, and `mpp` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `i` which is 2 is being returned.
