Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is False, `stdin` contains input greater than `n`, `i` is 0. If the current value of `i` is not a key in the dictionary `mpp`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.***
