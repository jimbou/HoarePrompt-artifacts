Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is True, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `first` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least one test case minus two inputs. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
