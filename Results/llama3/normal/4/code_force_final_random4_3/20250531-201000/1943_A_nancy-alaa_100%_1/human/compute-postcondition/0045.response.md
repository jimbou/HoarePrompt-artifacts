Output State: **`n` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts, `first` is False, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `i` which is 0 is being printed.**

The code `break` does not change the values of any variables, but it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `i` is still 0 and is being printed. The other variables remain unchanged.
