Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. The program uses a Counter to count the frequency of each number in the array, and then iterates through the numbers from 0 to n to find the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array or occurs only once and has not been seen before. This is the MEX of the array c, which is the score of the game.

The program handles the case where the MEX is 0, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array. It also handles the case where the MEX is a number that occurs only once in the array, in which case it is the smallest non-negative integer that occurs only once and has not been seen before.

The program also handles the case where the array contains all numbers from 0 to n, in which case the MEX is n+1. In this case, the program will print n+1, which is the correct MEX.

Overall, the program is correct and handles all potential cases.
