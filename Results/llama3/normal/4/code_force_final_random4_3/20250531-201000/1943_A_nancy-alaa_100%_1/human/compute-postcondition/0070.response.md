Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and returns the value of `i` which is 2. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.***
