Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 0 and 998 (inclusive), n is an integer, f is an integer, k is greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of integers, favorite_value is an integer equal to the f-th element of a, sorted_a is a list of integers equal to a sorted in descending order, stdin is empty, i is k, removed_count is equal to the number of times favorite_value appears in sorted_a up to index k, and favorite_count is the total number of occurrences of favorite_value in sorted_a.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if sorted_a[i] == favorite_value:
        removed_count += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 998 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the f-th element of `a`, `sorted_a` is a list of integers equal to `a` sorted in descending order, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `k`. If `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a` up to index `k` plus one. Otherwise, `removed_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a` up to index `k`. In both cases, `favorite_count` is the total number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 998 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is greater than its current value, `a` is a list of integers, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the f-th element of `a`, `sorted_a` is a list of integers equal to `a` sorted in descending order, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `k + 1`. If the i-th element of `sorted_a` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 998 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is greater than its current value, `a` is a list of integers, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the f-th element of `a`, `sorted_a` is a list of integers equal to `a` sorted in descending order, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `k + 2`. If the i-th element of `sorted_a` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
