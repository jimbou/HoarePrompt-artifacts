The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, so for the loop to execute again `i` must be equal to `k + 2` and `k` must be greater than its current value. 
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 998 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is greater than its current value, `a` is a list of integers, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the f-th element of `a`, `sorted_a` is a list of integers equal to `a` sorted in descending order, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `k + 2`.**
