According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0.
State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000) and `t` must be greater than 0**
