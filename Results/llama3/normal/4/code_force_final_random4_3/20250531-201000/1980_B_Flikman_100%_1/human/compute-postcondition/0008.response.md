Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the f-th element of `a`, `sorted_a` is a list of integers equal to `a` sorted in descending order, `stdin` contains 1 input: a list of integers, `i` is 1, `removed_count` is either 1 or 2. If the current value of `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is 2. Otherwise, `removed_count` is 1.**

In this output state, all variables from the initial state are still valid, but the value of `removed_count` has been updated. If the current value of `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is now 2, otherwise it is 1.
