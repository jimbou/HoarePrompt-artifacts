To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the state of the variable `i` and `k` since they are the only variables in the loop head.


At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.


The value of `k` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than 2.


State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 999 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the f-th element of `a`, `sorted_a` is a list of integers equal to `a` sorted in descending order, `stdin` is empty, `favorite_count` is equal to the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`, `i` is 2, and `removed_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a` up to index `k` if the current value of `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`, otherwise `removed_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a` up to index `k-1` plus one.**
