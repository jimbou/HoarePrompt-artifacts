Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 999 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the f-th element of `a`, `sorted_a` is a list of integers equal to `a` sorted in descending order, `stdin` is empty, `favorite_count` is equal to the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`, `i` is 2. If `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a` up to index `k`. Otherwise, `removed_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a` up to index `k-1` plus one.***
