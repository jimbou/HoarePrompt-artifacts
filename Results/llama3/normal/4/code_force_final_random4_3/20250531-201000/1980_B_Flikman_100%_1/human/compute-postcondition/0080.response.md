Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' for each case based on the presence of a favorite value in a sorted list of integers. It accepts no parameters and returns no values, instead printing the results directly to the console. The function's purpose is to determine whether a favorite value is present in the top k elements of a sorted list, and it performs this action for multiple test cases specified in the input.**
