Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 998 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is greater than its current value, `a` is a list of integers, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the f-th element of `a`, `sorted_a` is a list of integers equal to `a` sorted in descending order, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `k + 1`. If the i-th element of `sorted_a` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is increased by 1.***
