The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` test cases. Since `t` is assigned the first integer from the input, the stdin now contains `t` test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains `t` test cases.**
