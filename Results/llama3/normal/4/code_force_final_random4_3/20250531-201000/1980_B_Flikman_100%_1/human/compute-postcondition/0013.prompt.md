Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000) and t must be greater than 0, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, favorite_value is an integer equal to the f-th element of a, sorted_a is a list of integers equal to a sorted in descending order, removed_count is 0, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if sorted_a[i] == favorite_value:
        removed_count += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the f-th element of `a`, `sorted_a` is a list of integers equal to `a` sorted in descending order, `stdin` contains 1 input: a list of integers, `i` is 0. If the current value of `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is 1. Otherwise, `removed_count` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the f-th element of `a`, `sorted_a` is a list of integers equal to `a` sorted in descending order, `stdin` contains 1 input: a list of integers, `i` is 1. If the current value of `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is 2. Otherwise, `removed_count` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the f-th element of `a`, `sorted_a` is a list of integers equal to `a` sorted in descending order, `stdin` contains 1 input: a list of integers, `i` is 2. If the current value of `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is either 3 or 2. Otherwise, `removed_count` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
