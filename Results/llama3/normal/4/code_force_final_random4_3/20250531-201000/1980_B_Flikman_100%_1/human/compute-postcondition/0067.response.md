Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 998 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the f-th element of `a`, `sorted_a` is a list of integers equal to `a` sorted in descending order, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `k`, and the current value of `removed_count` equals the total number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a` up to index `k` and also equals the total number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a` (i.e., `favorite_count`).**
