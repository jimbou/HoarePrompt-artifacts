Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 998 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is greater than its current value, `a` is a list of integers, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the f-th element of `a`, `sorted_a` is a list of integers equal to `a` sorted in descending order, `removed_count` is increased by 1, `i` is equal to `k + 2`, `stdin` is empty**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `removed_count` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still between 0 and 998, `n` and `f` are still integers, `k` is still greater than its current value, `a` is still a list of integers, `favorite_value` is still equal to the f-th element of `a`, `sorted_a` is still a sorted list of integers equal to `a` in descending order, `i` is still equal to `k + 2`, and `stdin` is still empty.
