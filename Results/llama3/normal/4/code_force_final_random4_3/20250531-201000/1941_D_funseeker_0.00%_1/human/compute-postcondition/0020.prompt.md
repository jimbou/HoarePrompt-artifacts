Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, m is greater than 0, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing x, r is an integer, c is a string, temp is an empty set
Code of the loop:
for q in ans:
    if c == '0' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q + r) % n)
    if c == '1' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q - r) % n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 1 element, `r` is an integer, `q` is equal to `x`. If `c` is '1', `temp` is a set containing at least one element which is (x + r) % n and also (x - r) % n. If `c` is '?', `temp` is a set containing at least one element which is (x - r) % n. If `c` is neither '1' nor '?', `temp` remains an empty set.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 2 elements, `r` is an integer, `q` is the second element in the set. If `c` is '1', `temp` is a set containing at least four elements which are (x + r) % n, (x - r) % n, (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n. If `c` is '?', `temp` is a set containing at least three elements which are (x - r) % n, (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n. If `c` is neither '1' nor '?', `temp` contains at least two elements which are (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 3 elements, `r` is an integer, `q` is the third element in the set. If `c` is '1', `temp` is a set containing at least six elements which are (x + r) % n, (x - r) % n, (q + r) % n, (q - r) % n, (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n. If `c` is '?', `temp` is a set containing at least five elements which are (x - r) % n, (q + r) % n, (q - r) % n, (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n. If `c` is neither '1' nor '?', `temp` contains at least four elements which are (q + r) % n, (q - r) % n, (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n. If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing at least five elements which are (x - r) % n, (q + r) % n, (q - r) % n, (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
