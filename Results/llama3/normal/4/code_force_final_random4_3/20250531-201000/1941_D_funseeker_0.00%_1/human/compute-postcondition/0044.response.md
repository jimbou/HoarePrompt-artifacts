Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is 0, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans set, r is an integer, temp is an empty set**

The code executes the function `func_1()` and splits its return value into two variables, `r` and `c`. The value of `r` is then converted to an integer. The `temp` set is initialized as an empty set. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
