The only variable in the loop head is variable q and ans, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable ans. If ans is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, ans is a set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans set. So for the loop to be executed, ans must not be empty and q is one of the elements in the ans set.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a non-empty set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans set, `r` is an integer, `temp` is an empty set, `q` is one of the elements in the ans set**
