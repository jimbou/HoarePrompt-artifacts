Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least two elements, `r` is an integer, `q` is the next element in the set `ans` (different from the current value of `q`). If `c` is '1' or '?', then `temp` is a set containing the elements ((q + r) % n) and ((q - r) % n). If `c` is '0', then `temp` is a set containing the elements ((q + r) % n) and ((q - r) % n) has been added to `temp`.***
