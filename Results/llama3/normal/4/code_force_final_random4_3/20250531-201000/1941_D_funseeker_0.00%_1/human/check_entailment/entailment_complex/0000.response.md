Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic to solve the problem described. The program correctly handles the different cases for the direction of the throw (clockwise, counterclockwise, or unknown) and calculates the possible positions of the ball after each throw. It also correctly handles the case where the ball's position is 0, replacing it with n. The program's output matches the expected output format, printing the number of possible positions and then the positions themselves.

Correctness: **True**
