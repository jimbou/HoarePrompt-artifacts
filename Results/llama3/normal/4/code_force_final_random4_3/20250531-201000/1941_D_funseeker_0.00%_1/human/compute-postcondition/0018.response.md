Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 3 elements, `r` is an integer, `q` is the third element in the set. If `c` is '1', `temp` is a set containing at least six elements which are (x + r) % n, (x - r) % n, (q + r) % n, (q - r) % n, (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n. If `c` is '?', `temp` is a set containing at least five elements which are (x - r) % n, (q + r) % n, (q - r) % n, (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n. If `c` is neither '1' nor '?', `temp` contains at least four elements which are (q + r) % n, (q - r) % n, (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n. If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing at least five elements which are (x - r) % n, (q + r) % n, (q - r) % n, (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the set `temp` now contains an additional element `(q - r) % n`. The number of elements in `temp` has increased by one, depending on the value of `c`.
