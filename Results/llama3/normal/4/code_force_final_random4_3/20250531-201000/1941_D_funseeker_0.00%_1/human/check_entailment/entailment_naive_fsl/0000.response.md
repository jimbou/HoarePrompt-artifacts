Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. It correctly handles the cases where the direction of the throw is known ('0' for clockwise and '1' for counterclockwise) and the cases where the direction is unknown ('?'). 

The program uses a set to keep track of the possible positions of the ball after each throw, which allows it to efficiently handle the cases where the direction is unknown. The use of the modulo operator (`%`) ensures that the positions are correctly wrapped around the circle.

The program also correctly handles the case where the ball is thrown to a position that is the same as the starting position (i.e., `0`), by discarding `0` from the set and adding `n` instead.

I have not been able to find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
