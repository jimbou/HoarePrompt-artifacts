The only variable in the loop head is variable q and set ans, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set ans. If the set ans has at least 1 element the loop executes. Before the loop starts, ans is a set containing x, so for the loop to be executed  the set ans must have at least 1 element and q is x.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 1 element, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string, `temp` is an empty set, `q` is x**
