Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is greater than 0, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing x, r is an integer, c is a string, temp is an empty set**

The code snippet executes as follows: 

The first line calls the function `func_1()` and assigns the result to the variables `r` and `c` after splitting it. Since `func_1()` is not defined in the given code, we assume it returns a string that can be split into two parts. The first part is converted to an integer and assigned to `r`, while the second part is assigned to `c` as a string.

The second line creates an empty set and assigns it to the variable `temp`.

The initial state variables `n`, `m`, `x`, and `ans` are not modified by the code snippet. Therefore, their values remain the same.
