Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a non-empty set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans set, `r` is an integer, `temp` is an empty set, `q` is one of the elements in the ans set, and the current value of `c` is either '0' or '?'.**
