Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, m is 0, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans set, r is an integer, temp is an empty set
Code of the loop:
for q in ans:
    if c == '0' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q + r) % n)
    if c == '1' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q - r) % n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a non-empty set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans set, `r` is an integer, if `c` is either '1' or '?', then `temp` is a set containing the values (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n, otherwise `temp` remains empty, `q` is one of the elements in the ans set.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a non-empty set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans set, and at least one more element q', `r` is an integer, if `c` is either '1' or '?', then `temp` is a set containing the values (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n, otherwise `temp` remains empty, `q` is q'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a non-empty set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans set, and at least two elements q' and q'', `r` is an integer. If `c` is either '0' or '?', then `temp` is a set containing the values (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n, and `q` is q''. If `c` is '1', then `temp` contains (q - r) % n, and `q` is q''.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
