Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least two elements, `r` is an integer, `q` is the next element in the set `ans` (different from the current value of `q`), `c` is '0' or '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the elements ((q + r) % n) and ((q - r) % n) if `c` is '1' or '?', or a set containing the elements ((q + r) % n) and ((q - r) % n) if `c` is '0'.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include the element ((q - r) % n), in addition to the elements it already contained. The other variables remain unchanged. If `c` is '0' or '?', then `temp` now contains both ((q + r) % n) and ((q - r) % n). If `c` is '1' or '?', then `temp` now contains both ((q + r) % n) and ((q - r) % n).
