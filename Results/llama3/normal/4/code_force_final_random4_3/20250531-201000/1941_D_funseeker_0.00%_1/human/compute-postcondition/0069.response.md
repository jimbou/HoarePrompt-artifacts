The code prints the length of the set `ans`, which contains all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for all `q` in the initial `ans` set, after removing 0 and adding `n` if 0 was present.
Output: **n is a positive integer, m is 0, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans set, temp is a set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans set, q is the last element in the ans set. If 0 is in the ans set, then 0 is removed from the ans set and n is added to it., and the length of the ans set is being printed**
