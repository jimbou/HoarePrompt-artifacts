Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 2 elements, `r` is an integer, `q` is the second element in the set. If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing at least two elements which are (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n. If `c` is '?', `temp` is a set containing at least three elements which are (x - r) % n, (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n. If `c` is '1', `temp` is a set containing at least four elements which are (x + r) % n, (x - r) % n, (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n. If `c` is neither '1', '0' nor '?', `temp` contains at least two elements which are (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, and `q` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is in the `temp` set, which now contains an additional element `(q - r) % n` in all cases. The size of the `temp` set has increased by at least one element, and its contents depend on the value of `c`.
