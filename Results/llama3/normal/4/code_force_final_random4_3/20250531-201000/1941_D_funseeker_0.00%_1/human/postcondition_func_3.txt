This function calculates and prints the number of unique possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for all `q` in an initial set, and then prints the unique values themselves, excluding 0 and including `n` if 0 was present. It takes no arguments and returns no value, but instead prints the results directly. The function assumes that `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, and `x` is a positive integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive).
