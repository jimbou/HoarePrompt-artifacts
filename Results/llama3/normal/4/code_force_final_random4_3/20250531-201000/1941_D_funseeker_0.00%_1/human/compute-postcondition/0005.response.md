Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 1 element, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string such that `c` is either '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing at least one element which is (x + r) % n, and `q` is equal to `x`.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include the result of the expression `(q + r) % n`, where `q` is equal to `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
