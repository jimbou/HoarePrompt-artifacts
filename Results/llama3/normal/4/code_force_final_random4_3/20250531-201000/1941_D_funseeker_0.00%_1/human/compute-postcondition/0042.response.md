Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans set, `r` is an integer, `temp` is a set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans set.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be equal to `temp`, which is a set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans set. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
