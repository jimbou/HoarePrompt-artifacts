Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least one element, `r` is an integer, `q` is the first element in the set `ans`. The current value of `c` is either '1' or '?'. If `c` is '0', the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, `temp` is a set containing two elements which are (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include a new element `(q - r) % n`, in addition to the existing element `(q + r) % n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
