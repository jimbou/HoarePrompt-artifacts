Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is an empty set, `r` is an integer, `temp` is a set containing all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for all `q` in the initial `ans` set.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state is such that `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged, `ans` becomes an empty set because all its elements have been processed, `r` remains the same, and `temp` contains all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for all `q` that were initially in the `ans` set. The exact number of elements in `temp` depends on the initial size of `ans` and the value of `c`.
