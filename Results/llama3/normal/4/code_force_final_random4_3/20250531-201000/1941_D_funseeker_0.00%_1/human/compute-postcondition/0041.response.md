Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is an empty set, `r` is an integer, `temp` is a set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans set.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the set `ans` is empty, and the set `temp` contains all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial `ans` set. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and `r` remain unchanged.
