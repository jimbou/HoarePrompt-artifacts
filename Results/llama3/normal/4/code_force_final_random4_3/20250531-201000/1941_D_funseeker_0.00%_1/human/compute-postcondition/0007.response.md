Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 1 element, `r` is an integer, `q` is equal to `x`. The current value of `c` is either '1' or '?'. If `c` is '1', `temp` is a set containing at least one element which is (x + r) % n. If `c` is '?', `temp` remains an empty set.***
