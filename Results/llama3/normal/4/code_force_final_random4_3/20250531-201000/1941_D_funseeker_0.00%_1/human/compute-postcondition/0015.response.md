The only object in the loop head is variable  q and set ans, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the ans.  If the set has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, ans has at least 2 elements, q is the second element in the set. So for the loop to be executed one more time the set must have at least 3 elements and the q is the third element in the set.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 3 elements, `r` is an integer, `q` is the third element in the set. If `c` is '1', `temp` is a set containing at least four elements which are (x + r) % n, (x - r) % n, (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n. If `c` is '?', `temp` is a set containing at least three elements which are (x - r) % n, (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n. If `c` is neither '1' nor '?', `temp` contains at least two elements which are (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n.**
