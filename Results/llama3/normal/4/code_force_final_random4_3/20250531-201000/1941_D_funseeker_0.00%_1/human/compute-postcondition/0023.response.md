Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is greater than 1, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans set, r is an integer, temp is an empty set.**

The code snippet executes as follows:

1. `r, c = func_1().split()`: This line assigns the result of `func_1().split()` to `r` and `c`. Since `func_1()` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it returns a string that can be split into two parts. The value of `r` is now a string, and `c` is also a string.

2. `r = int(r)`: This line converts the string value of `r` to an integer. The value of `r` is now an integer.

3. `temp = set()`: This line assigns an empty set to `temp`. The value of `temp` is now an empty set.

The final state is a combination of the initial state and the changes made by the code snippet. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and `ans` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The value of `r` is now an integer, and the value of `temp` is an empty set.
