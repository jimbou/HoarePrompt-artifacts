Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least one element, `r` is an integer, `q` is the first element in the set `ans`. If `c` is '0', the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing two elements which are (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n. Otherwise, if `c` is either '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing one element which is (q + r) % n.***
