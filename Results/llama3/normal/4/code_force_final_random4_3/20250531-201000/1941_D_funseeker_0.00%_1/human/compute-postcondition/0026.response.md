Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least one element, `r` is an integer, `temp` is a set containing one element which is (q + r) % n, `q` is the first element in the set `ans`, `c` is either '0' or '?'**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include the element `(q + r) % n`, where `q` is the first element in the set `ans` and `r` is an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.
