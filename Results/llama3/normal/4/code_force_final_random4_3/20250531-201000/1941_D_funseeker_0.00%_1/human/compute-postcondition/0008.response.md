Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 1 element, `r` is an integer, `q` is equal to `x`. The current value of `c` is either '1' or '?'. If `c` is '1', `temp` is a set containing at least one element which is (x + r) % n and also (x - r) % n. If `c` is '?', `temp` is a set containing at least one element which is (x - r) % n.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated based on the value of `c`. If `c` is '1', then `temp` now contains at least two elements: `(x + r) % n` and `(x - r) % n`. If `c` is '?', then `temp` now contains at least one element: `(x - r) % n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
