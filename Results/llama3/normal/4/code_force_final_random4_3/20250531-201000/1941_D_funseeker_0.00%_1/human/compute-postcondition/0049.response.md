Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a non-empty set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans set, `r` is an integer, if `c` is either '0' or '?', then `temp` is a set containing the value (q + r) % n, otherwise `temp` remains empty, `q` is one of the elements in the ans set. The current value of `c` is either '1' or '?'***
