#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a string
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns a string that was read from the standard input (stdin), with any leading or trailing whitespace removed.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a line of input from the standard input (stdin) and returns the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: func_1() returns a string that represents an integer.
    return int(func_1())
    #The program returns an integer that is represented by the string returned by func_1()

#Overall this is what the function does:Converts a string representation of an integer returned by func_1() to an integer and returns it.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: func_1() returns a string of space-separated integers.
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers that were originally space-separated in the string returned by func_1()

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a string of space-separated integers as input from func_1(), splits it into individual integers, converts them to a list of integers, and returns this list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n.
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)

        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)

    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for all `q` in the initial `ans` set, `r` is an integer, `temp` is a set containing all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for all `q` in the initial `ans` set, `q` is the last element in the `ans` set.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: *n is a positive integer, m is 0, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans set, temp is a set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans set, q is the last element in the ans set. If 0 is in the ans set, then 0 is removed from the ans set and n is added to it.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: the number of unique values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans set, minus one if 0 was present in the ans set
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: the elements of the ans set (which are the possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans set, excluding 0 and including n)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and prints the number of unique possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for all `q` in an initial set, and then prints the unique values themselves, excluding 0 and including `n` if 0 was present. It takes no arguments and returns no value, but instead prints the results directly. The function assumes that `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, and `x` is a positive integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive).
