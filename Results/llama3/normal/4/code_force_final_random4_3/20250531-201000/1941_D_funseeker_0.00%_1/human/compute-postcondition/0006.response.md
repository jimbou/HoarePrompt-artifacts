Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 1 element, `r` is an integer, `q` is equal to `x`. If `c` is either '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing at least one element which is (x + r) % n. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.***
