Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a non-empty set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans set, `r` is an integer, `temp` is a set containing the values (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n, `q` is one of the elements in the ans set.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include the value `(q - r) % n` because the current value of `c` is either '1' or '?'. The other variables remain unchanged.
