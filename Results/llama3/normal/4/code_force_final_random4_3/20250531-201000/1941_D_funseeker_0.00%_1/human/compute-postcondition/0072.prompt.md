You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n.
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)
        
        temp = set()
        
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        
        ans = temp
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for all `q` in the initial `ans` set, `r` is an integer, `temp` is a set containing all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for all `q` in the initial `ans` set, `q` is the last element in the `ans` set.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: *n is a positive integer, m is 0, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans set, temp is a set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans set, q is the last element in the ans set. If 0 is in the ans set, then 0 is removed from the ans set and n is added to it.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: the number of unique values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans set, minus one if 0 was present in the ans set
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: the elements of the ans set (which are the possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans set, excluding 0 and including n)

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
