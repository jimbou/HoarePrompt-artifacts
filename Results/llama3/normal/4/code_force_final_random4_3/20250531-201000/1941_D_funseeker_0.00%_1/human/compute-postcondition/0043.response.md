The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` is increased by 1 and `m` must be greater than 1. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, we don't need to keep track of its value. We only need to keep track of `m`. So `m` is decreased by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans set, `r` is an integer, `temp` is a set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans set.**
