Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least two elements, `r` is an integer, `q` is the second element in the set `ans`. If `c` is '0' or '?', then `temp` is a set containing the elements ((q + r) % n) and ((q - r) % n).**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, and `q` remain unchanged. The only change is in the set `temp`, which now contains two elements: `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. This is because the code adds the new element `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`, which already contained the element `(q + r) % n` due to the initial condition.
