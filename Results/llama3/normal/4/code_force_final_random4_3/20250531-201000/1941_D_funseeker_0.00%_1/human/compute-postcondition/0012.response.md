Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 2 elements, `r` is an integer, `q` is the second element in the set. If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing at least one element which is (q + r) % n. If `c` is '?', `temp` is a set containing at least one element which is (x - r) % n and (q + r) % n. If `c` is '1', `temp` is a set containing at least one element which is (x + r) % n, (x - r) % n and (q + r) % n. If `c` is neither '1', '0' nor '?', `temp` contains at least one element which is (q + r) % n.***
