Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 2 elements, `r` is an integer, `q` is the second element in the set. If `c` is '1', `temp` is a set containing at least four elements which are (x + r) % n, (x - r) % n, (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n. If `c` is '?', `temp` is a set containing at least three elements which are (x - r) % n, (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n. If `c` is neither '1' nor '?', `temp` contains at least two elements which are (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n.**
