Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a non-empty set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans set, and at least one more element q', `r` is an integer, `temp` is a set containing the values (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n, `q` is q'.**

The value of `temp` is updated by adding the value `(q - r) % n` to the set. The other variables remain unchanged. The set `temp` now contains the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. The set `ans` still contains all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for all `q` in the initial `ans` set, and at least one more element `q'`.
