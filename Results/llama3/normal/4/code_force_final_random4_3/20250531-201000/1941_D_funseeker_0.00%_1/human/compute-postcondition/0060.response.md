Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a non-empty set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans set, and at least two elements q' and q'', `r` is an integer. If `c` is either '0' or '?', then `temp` is a set containing the values (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n, and `q` is q''. If `c` is '1', then `temp` contains (q - r) % n, and `q` is q''.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include the value `(q - r) % n`, in addition to its previous values. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `q` is still q'' if `c` is either '0' or '?', and it is also q'' if `c` is '1'. The set `ans` still contains all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans set, and at least two elements q' and q''.
