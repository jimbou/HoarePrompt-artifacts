Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a non-empty set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans set, and at least two elements q' and q'', `r` is an integer, `temp` is a set containing the values (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n, and `q` is q''**

The code adds the value `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `temp` already contains the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, the addition of `(q + r) % n` does not change the fact that `temp` contains these values. The other variables remain unchanged.
