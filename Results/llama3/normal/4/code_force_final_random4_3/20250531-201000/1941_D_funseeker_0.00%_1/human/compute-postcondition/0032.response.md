Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least two elements, `r` is an integer, `q` is the second element in the set `ans`, `temp` is a set containing the element ((q + r) % n).**

The value of `temp` is updated by adding the element `(q + r) % n`, where `q` is the second element in the set `ans` and `r` is an integer. The values of the other variables are not affected.
