Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `M1` is an integer between 1 and `N`, `M2` is an integer between 1 and `N`, `L` is a list of `M1` integers, `R` is a list of `M2` integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` is 1, and the first element of `R` is `N`. Either `M1` is 1, `M2` is 1, or the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`, `ans` is the number of ways to choose `L[-1] - 1` elements from `N - 1` elements multiplied by `L[-1] - 4` modulo MOD, `cur` is either `M1 - 4` or `M1 - 3`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`, and `L[-1]` must be greater than 2. Additionally, if `i` is not equal to `L[cur]`, `i` must be greater than 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, and stdin remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `ans` is updated to be the product of the number of ways to choose `L[-1] - 1` elements from `N - 1` elements and `L[-1] - 4` modulo MOD. The value of `cur` is either `M1 - 4` or `M1 - 3`, depending on whether `i` is equal to `L[cur]`. The value of `nums_left` is updated to `L[-1] - 4`. The constraints on `L[-1]` and `i` remain the same as in the initial state.
