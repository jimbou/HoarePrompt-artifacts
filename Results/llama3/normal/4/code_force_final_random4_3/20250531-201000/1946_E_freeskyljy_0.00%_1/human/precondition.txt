stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains three integers n, m1, and m2 (1 <= m1, m2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains m1 integers p1 < p2 < ... < pm1 (1 <= pi <= n). The third line contains m2 integers s1 < s2 < ... < sm2 (1 <= si <= n).
