Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N and is greater than 1, L is a list of M1 integers, R is a list of M2 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, the first element of L is 1, and the first element of R is N. Either M1 is 1 or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. If M1 is greater than 1, then the current value of ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements, cur is 1, nums_left is N - R[0] - 1, and i is R[0] + 1. Otherwise, the current value of ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements, and cur is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been updated to 1, and the value of `i` has been updated to `R[0] + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
