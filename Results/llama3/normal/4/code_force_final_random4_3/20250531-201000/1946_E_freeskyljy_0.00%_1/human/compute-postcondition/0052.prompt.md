Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N and is greater than 1, L is a list of M1 integers, R is a list of M2 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, the first element of L is 1, and the first element of R is N. Either M1 is 1 or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. If M1 is greater than 1, then the current value of ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements, cur is 1, nums_left is N - R[0] - 1, and i is R[0] + 1. Otherwise, the current value of ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements, and cur is 1.
Code of the loop:
while i < N:
    if i == R[cur]:
        cur += 1
    else:
        ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
    nums_left -= 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and N is greater than R[0] + 1, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N and is greater than 1, L is a list of M1 integers, R is a list of M2 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, the first element of L is 1, and the first element of R is N. Either M1 is 1 or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. If i is equal to R[cur], then the current value of ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements, cur is 2, nums_left is N - R[0] - 2, and i is R[0] + 2. If i is not equal to R[cur], then if M1 is greater than 1, the current value of ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements multiplied by N - R[0] - 1 modulo MOD, cur is 1, nums_left is N - R[0] - 2, and i is not equal to R[cur]. Otherwise, the current value of ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements, and cur is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and N is greater than R[0] + 1, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N and is greater than 1, L is a list of M1 integers, R is a list of M2 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, the first element of L is 1, and the first element of R is N. Either M1 is 1 or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. If i is equal to R[cur], then the current value of ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements, cur is 3, and nums_left is N - R[0] - 3. If i is not equal to R[cur], then if M1 is greater than 1, the current value of ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements multiplied by (N - R[0] - 1) * (N - R[0] - 2) modulo MOD, cur is 1, and nums_left is N - R[0] - 3. Otherwise, the current value of ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements multiplied by N - R[0] - 2 modulo MOD, and cur is 1 or 2. i is less than or equal to R[0] + 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and N is greater than R[0] + 1, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N and is greater than 1, L is a list of M1 integers, R is a list of M2 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, the first element of L is 1, and the first element of R is N. Either M1 is 1 or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. If i is equal to R[cur], then the current value of ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements, cur is 4, and nums_left is N - R[0] - 4. If i is not equal to R[cur], then if M1 is greater than 1, the current value of ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements multiplied by (N - R[0] - 1) * (N - R[0] - 2) modulo MOD, cur is 1, and nums_left is N - R[0] - 4. Otherwise, the current value of ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements multiplied by N - R[0] - 2 modulo MOD, and cur is 1 or 2. i is greater than R[0] + 1 and less than N.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
