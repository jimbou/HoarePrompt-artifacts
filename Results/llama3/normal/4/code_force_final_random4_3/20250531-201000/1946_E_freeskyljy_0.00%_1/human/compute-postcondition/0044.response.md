Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and `N` is greater than `R[0]` + 1, `M1` is an integer between 1 and `N`, `M2` is an integer between 1 and `N` and is greater than 1, `L` is a list of `M1` integers, `R` is a list of `M2` integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` is 1, and the first element of `R` is `N`. Either `M1` is 1 or the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then the current value of `ans` is the number of ways to choose `L[-1]` - 1 elements from `N` - 1 elements multiplied by `N` - `R[0]` - 2 modulo `MOD`, `cur` is 2, `nums_left` is `N` - `R[0]` - 2, and `i` is `R[0]` + 2. If `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, then if `M1` is greater than 1, the current value of `ans` is the number of ways to choose `L[-1]` - 1 elements from `N` - 1 elements multiplied by (`N` - `R[0]` - 1) * (`N` - `R[0]` - 2) modulo `MOD`, `cur` is 1, `nums_left` is `N` - `R[0]` - 2, and `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`. Otherwise, the current value of `ans` is the number of ways to choose `L[-1]` - 1 elements from `N` - 1 elements multiplied by `N` - `R[0]` - 2 modulo `MOD`, and `cur` is 1. `i` is less than or equal to `R[0]` + 1.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `ans` has been updated by multiplying it with `nums_left` (which is `N` - `R[0]` - 2) modulo `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and relationships between the variables are still valid, and the value of `ans` has been updated accordingly based on the conditions.
