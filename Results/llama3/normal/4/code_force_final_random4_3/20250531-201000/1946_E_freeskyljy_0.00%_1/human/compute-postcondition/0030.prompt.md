Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N, L is a list of M1 integers, R is a list of M2 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, the first element of L is 1, and the first element of R is N. Either M1 is 1, M2 is 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R, ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements, cur is M1 - 2, nums_left is L[-1] - 2, i is L[-1] - 1.
Code of the loop:
while i > 1:
    if i == L[cur]:
        cur -= 1
    else:
        ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
    nums_left -= 1
    i -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N, L is a list of M1 integers, R is a list of M2 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, the first element of L is 1, and the first element of R is N. Either M1 is 1, M2 is 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R, ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements, cur is M1 - 3 if i is equal to L[cur], otherwise cur is M1 - 2, nums_left is L[-1] - 3, and L[-1] must be greater than 2. Additionally, if i is not equal to L[cur], ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements multiplied by L[-1] - 3 modulo MOD, and i is one less than its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N, L is a list of M1 integers, R is a list of M2 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, the first element of L is 1, and the first element of R is N. Either M1 is 1, M2 is 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R, ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements, cur is updated based on whether i is equal to L[cur], nums_left is L[-1] - 3, and L[-1] must be greater than 2. Additionally, if i is not equal to L[cur], ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements multiplied by L[-1] - 3 modulo MOD, and i must be greater than 1. If i is equal to L[cur], cur is updated to M1 - 4, otherwise cur is updated to M1 - 3, and ans is updated to be ans * nums_left % MOD if i is not equal to L[cur]. nums_left is now L[-1] - 4, and i is now i - 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N, L is a list of M1 integers, R is a list of M2 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, the first element of L is 1, and the first element of R is N. Either M1 is 1, M2 is 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. If i is equal to L[cur], cur is updated to M1 - 4, ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements, and nums_left is L[-1] - 4. If i is not equal to L[cur], cur is updated to M1 - 3, ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements multiplied by L[-1] - 3 modulo MOD if i is greater than 1, and ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements multiplied by L[-1] - 4 modulo MOD if i is greater than 2. In both cases, nums_left is L[-1] - 4, and L[-1] must be greater than 2. nums_left is now L[-1] - 5, and i is now one less than its original value.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
