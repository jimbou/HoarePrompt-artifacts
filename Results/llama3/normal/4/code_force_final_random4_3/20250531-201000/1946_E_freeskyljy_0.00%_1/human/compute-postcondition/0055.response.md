Functionality: **This function calculates the number of ways to choose a certain number of elements from a given range, based on the input provided. It takes as input three integers N, M1, and M2, representing the length of a permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively. It also takes two lists of integers, L and R, representing the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums in increasing order. The function returns an integer value, which is either 0 or the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements. The function performs various checks on the input values and returns 0 if certain conditions are not met. If the conditions are met, it calculates the number of ways to choose the elements using a combination formula and returns the result.**
