Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N, L is a list of M1 integers, R is a list of M2 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, the first element of L is 1, and the first element of R is N. Either M1 is 1, M2 is 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R, ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements, cur is M1 - 3, nums_left is L[-1] - 2, and L[-1] must be greater than 2. The current value of i is equal to the current value of L[cur].**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `cur` has been decremented by 1, so it is now `M1 - 3`. The value of `i` is still equal to the current value of `L[cur]`, but since `cur` has changed, `i` is now equal to the value of `L[M1 - 3]`. All other variables and conditions remain the same.
