To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the state of `i` in the loop head. According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is greater than 1. Right before the loop, `i` is `L[-1] - 1`. To guarantee that `i` is greater than 1, we need to adjust the state of `L[-1]` to be greater than 2.

State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N, L is a list of M1 integers, R is a list of M2 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, the first element of L is 1, and the first element of R is N. Either M1 is 1, M2 is 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R, ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements, cur is M1 - 2, nums_left is L[-1] - 2, and L[-1] must be greater than 2**
