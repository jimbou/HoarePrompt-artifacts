Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and N is greater than R[0] + 1, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N and is greater than 1, L is a list of M1 integers, R is a list of M2 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, the first element of L is 1, and the first element of R is N. Either M1 is 1 or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. If i is equal to R[cur], then the current value of ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements, cur is 4, and nums_left is N - R[0] - 4. If i is not equal to R[cur], then if M1 is greater than 1, the current value of ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements multiplied by (N - R[0] - 1) * (N - R[0] - 2) modulo MOD, cur is 1, and nums_left is N - R[0] - 4. Otherwise, the current value of ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements multiplied by N - R[0] - 2 modulo MOD, and cur is 1 or 2. i is greater than R[0] + 1 and less than N.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `nums_left -= 1` and `i += 1`. The first line decrements the value of `nums_left` by 1, and the second line increments the value of `i` by 1. 

The initial state provides information about the variables N, M1, M2, L, R, stdin, and the relationships between them. It also provides information about the current values of ans, cur, and nums_left based on the value of i.

After executing the code, the value of `nums_left` is decremented by 1, and the value of `i` is incremented by 1. The relationships between the variables and the conditions provided in the initial state remain valid. The current values of ans, cur, and nums_left are updated based on the new value of i.

The final output state includes all the information from the initial state that remains valid after the code execution, along with the updated values of `nums_left` and `i`. The current values of ans, cur, and nums_left are updated based on the new value of i, and the relationships between the variables are maintained.
