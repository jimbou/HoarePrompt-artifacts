Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N, L is a list of M1 integers, R is a list of M2 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, the first element of L is 1, and the first element of R is N. Either M1 is 1, M2 is 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R, ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements, cur is M1 - 3 if i is equal to L[cur], otherwise cur is M1 - 2, nums_left is L[-1] - 3, and L[-1] must be greater than 2. Additionally, if i is not equal to L[cur], ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements multiplied by L[-1] - 3 modulo MOD, and i is one less than its original value.**
