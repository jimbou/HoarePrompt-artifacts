Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `M1` is an integer between 1 and `N`, `M2` is an integer between 1 and `N`, `L` is a list of `M1` integers, `R` is a list of `M2` integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` is 1, and the first element of `R` is `N`. Either `M1` is 1, `M2` is 1, or the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`, `ans` is the number of ways to choose `L[-1] - 1` elements from `N - 1` elements multiplied by `L[-1] - 2` modulo `MOD`, `cur` is `M1 - 2`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`, and `L[-1]` must be greater than 2. Additionally, `i` is not equal to `L[cur]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been updated to be the result of multiplying the previous value of `ans` by `L[-1] - 2` modulo `MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged.
