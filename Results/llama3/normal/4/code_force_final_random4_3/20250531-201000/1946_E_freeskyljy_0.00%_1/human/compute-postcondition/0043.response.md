Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and N is greater than R[0] + 1, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N and is greater than 1, L is a list of M1 integers, R is a list of M2 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, the first element of L is 1, and the first element of R is N. Either M1 is 1 or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. If i is equal to R[cur], then the current value of ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements, cur is 3, nums_left is N - R[0] - 2, and i is R[0] + 2. If i is not equal to R[cur], then if M1 is greater than 1, the current value of ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements multiplied by N - R[0] - 1 modulo MOD, cur is 2, nums_left is N - R[0] - 2, and i is not equal to R[cur]. Otherwise, the current value of ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements, and cur is 2. i is less than or equal to R[0] + 1**

In natural language, the output state is: N, M1, M2, L, and R remain unchanged. The value of cur is incremented by 1. If i is equal to R[cur], then ans remains the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements, and cur becomes 3. If i is not equal to R[cur], then if M1 is greater than 1, ans remains the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements multiplied by N - R[0] - 1 modulo MOD, and cur becomes 2. Otherwise, ans remains the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements, and cur becomes 2. The value of nums_left remains N - R[0] - 2, and i remains less than or equal to R[0] + 1.
