Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N, L is a list of M1 integers, R is a list of M2 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, the first element of L is 1, and the first element of R is N. Either M1 is 1, M2 is 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R, ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements, cur is 0, nums_left is 0, and i is 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the values of the variables in the loop head and body. The values of N, M1, M2, L, R, and stdin remain unchanged. The value of ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements, which is the same as the initial value of ans. The value of cur is 0, which means that the loop has executed M1 - 1 times. The value of nums_left is 0, which means that there are no more elements to process. The value of i is 1, which means that the loop has finished executing.
