Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N, L is a list of M1 integers, R is a list of M2 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, the first element of L is 1, and the first element of R is N. Either M1 is 1, M2 is 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R, ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements, cur is M1 - 2, nums_left is L[-1] - 2, i is L[-1] - 1.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The value of N remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5. The values of M1 and M2 also remain unchanged, still integers between 1 and N. The lists L and R remain unchanged, with L still having M1 integers and R still having M2 integers. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one. The last element of L is still equal to the first element of R, the first element of L is still 1, and the first element of R is still N. The condition that either M1 is 1, M2 is 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R still holds. The value of ans remains unchanged, still the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements. The value of cur remains unchanged, still M1 - 2. Two new variables, nums_left and i, are introduced. nums_left is assigned the value of L[-1] - 2, and i is assigned the value of L[-1] - 1.
