Postcondition: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N, L is a list of M1 integers, R is a list of M2 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, the first element of L is 1, and the first element of R is N. Either M1 is 1, M2 is 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. If M2 is greater than 1, then if i is equal to N, the current value of ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements, cur is M2, and nums_left is 0. If i is not equal to N, then if M1 is greater than 1, the current value of ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements multiplied by the product of all numbers from N - R[0] down to 1 modulo MOD, cur is 1, and nums_left is 0. Otherwise, the current value of ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements multiplied by the product of all numbers from N - R[0] down to 2 modulo MOD, and cur is 1 or greater than 1 and less than or equal to M2. i is equal to N. If M2 is not greater than 1, then ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements, and cur is 0 if M1 is greater than 1, otherwise cur is M1 - 2.**
