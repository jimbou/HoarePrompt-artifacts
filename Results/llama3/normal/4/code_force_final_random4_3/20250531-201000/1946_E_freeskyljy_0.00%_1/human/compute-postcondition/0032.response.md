Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N, L is a list of M1 integers, R is a list of M2 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, the first element of L is 1, and the first element of R is N. Either M1 is 1, M2 is 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. If M1 is greater than 1, then ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements, cur is 0, nums_left is N - R[0] - 1, and i is 1. Otherwise, ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements, and cur is M1 - 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of N, M1, M2, L, R, and stdin remain the same as in the initial state. The last element of L is still equal to the first element of R, the first element of L is still 1, and the first element of R is still N. The condition that either M1 is 1, M2 is 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R still holds. If M1 is greater than 1, then the value of ans is still the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements, cur is still 0, and i is still 1. However, the value of nums_left has been updated to N - R[0] - 1. If M1 is not greater than 1, then the value of ans is still the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements, and cur is still M1 - 2.
