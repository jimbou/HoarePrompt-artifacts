Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where arr[left + mid - i - 1] is small_element + i for all i in range(mid), and arr[left + mid + i] is big_element - i for all i in range(not_mid), cliquess is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where cliquess[left + i] is clique for all i in range(mid), and cliquess[left + mid + i] is clique for all i in range(not_mid), small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is greater than or equal to 0, not_mid is greater than or equal to 0, and i is not_mid - 1.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the array `arr` will have its elements from index `left + mid` to `right` (inclusive) set to `big_element - i` where `i` ranges from 0 to `not_mid - 1`. Similarly, the list `cliquess` will have its elements from index `left + mid` to `right` (inclusive) set to `clique`. The other variables remain unchanged.
