Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description. It assigns distinct integers to each vertex, and the partitioning into cliques seems to be done correctly.

The `func_1` function calculates the number of cliques needed, which is the ceiling of `n / k`. It then initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, to store the assigned integers and clique numbers, respectively.

The `make_array` function is used to assign integers to the vertices in each clique. It calculates the midpoint of the range of vertices in the clique and assigns the smaller integers to the left half and the larger integers to the right half. This ensures that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is satisfied for all pairs of vertices in the clique.

The program then prints the assigned integers, the number of cliques, and the clique numbers for each vertex.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program seems to handle all possible inputs correctly, and the logic is sound. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
