Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where arr[left + mid - i - 1] is small_element + i for all i in range(mid), and arr[left + mid + i] is big_element - i for i = 0, cliquess is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where cliquess[left + i] is clique for all i in range(mid), and cliquess[left + mid + i] is clique for i = 0, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is greater than or equal to 0, not_mid is greater than 0, and i is 0.**

In this final state, the values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`, and `i` remain unchanged. The list `arr` has an additional element at index `left + mid + i` (where `i` is 0) with the value `big_element - i`, which is `right + 1 - 0 = right + 1`. Similarly, the list `cliquess` has an additional element at index `left + mid + i` (where `i` is 0) with the value `clique`. The rest of the elements in `arr` and `cliquess` retain their original values.
