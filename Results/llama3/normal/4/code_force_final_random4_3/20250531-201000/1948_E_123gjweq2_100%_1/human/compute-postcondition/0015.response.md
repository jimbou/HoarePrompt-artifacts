Functionality: **The function takes in a list of integers `arr` and a list of integers `cliquess`, along with three integers `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It modifies the elements of `arr` and `cliquess` within the range `left` to `right` (inclusive) in a specific pattern. The function first sets the elements of `arr` from `left` to `left + mid - 1` to a sequence of increasing integers starting from `left + 1`, and sets the corresponding elements of `cliquess` to `clique`. Then, it sets the elements of `arr` from `left + mid` to `right` to a sequence of decreasing integers starting from `right + 1`, and sets the corresponding elements of `cliquess` to `clique`. The function does not return any value.**
