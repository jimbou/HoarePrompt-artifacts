Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a graph into the minimum possible number of cliques. The program takes two integers, n and k, as input and assigns distinct integers from 1 to n to each vertex. It then creates a graph where an edge is added between two vertices if the sum of the absolute differences between their indices and assigned integers is less than or equal to k.

The program uses two functions: func_1 and make_array. The func_1 function calculates the number of cliques required, initializes arrays to store the assigned integers and clique assignments, and calls the make_array function to populate these arrays. The make_array function assigns integers to the vertices in a way that minimizes the number of cliques.

The program's logic is correct, and it produces the desired output for the given problem. It correctly calculates the number of cliques, assigns integers to the vertices, and partitions the graph into the minimum possible number of cliques.

Correctness: **True**
