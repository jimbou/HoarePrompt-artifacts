Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where arr[left + mid - i - 1] is small_element + i for all i in range(mid), and arr[left + mid + i] is big_element - i for i = 3, cliquess is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where cliquess[left + i] is clique for all i in range(mid), and cliquess[left + mid + i] is clique for i = 3, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is greater than or equal to 0, not_mid is greater than 2, and i is 3.**

The code modifies the values of `arr` and `cliquess` at index `left + mid + i`. The first line updates `arr[left + mid + i]` to `big_element - i`, which is `right + 1 - 2` since `i` is 2. This makes `arr[left + mid + 2]` equal to `right - 1`. The second line updates `cliquess[left + mid + i]` to `clique`, which remains unchanged since `clique` is already assigned to `cliquess[left + mid + i]` for `i = 2`. The value of `i` is incremented to 3 after the execution of the code. No other variables are affected.
