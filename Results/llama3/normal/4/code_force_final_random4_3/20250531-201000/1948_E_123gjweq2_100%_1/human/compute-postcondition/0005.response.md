To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for i in range(mid):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `i` is 1, and `mid` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `mid`. Since `i` is 1, we need to increment it by 1 to make it 2. The value of `mid` remains the same.

The other variables in the state, such as `left`, `right`, `clique`, `arr`, `cliquess`, `small_element`, `big_element`, and `not_mid`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers of length at least `right` + 1 where `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `small_element` + `i`, `cliquess` is a list of integers of length at least `right` + 1 where `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`, `small_element` is `left` + 1, `big_element` is `right` + 1, `mid` is greater than 0, `not_mid` is `right` - `left` + 1 - `mid`, and `i` is 2**
