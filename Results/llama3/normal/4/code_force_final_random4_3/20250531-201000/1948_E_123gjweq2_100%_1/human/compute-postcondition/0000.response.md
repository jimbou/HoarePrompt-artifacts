Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of integers of length at least right + 1, cliquess is a list of integers of length at least right + 1, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, and not_mid is right - left + 1 - (right - left + 1) // 2.**

In this final state, the values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `arr`, and `cliquess` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The new variables `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` are introduced with their respective values calculated based on the initial values of `left` and `right`.
