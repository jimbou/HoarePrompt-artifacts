The function takes two positive integers n and k as input, where 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n. It calculates the ceiling of n/k and creates a list of n integers, where each integer from 1 to the ceiling value is repeated k times. The function then prints this list, the ceiling value, and a list of n zeros. The function does not return any value, but rather prints the results directly.
