Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where arr[left + mid - i - 1] is small_element + i for all i in range(mid), and arr[left + mid + i] is big_element - i for i = 1, cliquess is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where cliquess[left + i] is clique for all i in range(mid), and cliquess[left + mid + i] is clique for i = 1, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is greater than or equal to 0, not_mid is greater than 1, and i is 1.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `arr[left + mid + i]` and `cliquess[left + mid + i]`. The first line assigns the value of `big_element - i` to `arr[left + mid + i]`, and the second line assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + mid + i]`. The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`, and `i` remain unchanged. The lists `arr` and `cliquess` are modified at the specified indices, but their lengths and other elements remain the same.
