Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where arr[left + mid - i - 1] is small_element + i for all i in range(mid), cliquess is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where cliquess[left + i] is clique for all i in range(mid), small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is greater than or equal to 0, not_mid is right - left + 1 - mid, and i is mid - 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` remain unchanged.
*   The list `arr` has been modified such that the elements at indices `left + mid - i - 1` are set to `small_element + i` for all `i` in the range of `mid`.
*   The list `cliquess` has been modified such that the elements at indices `left + i` are set to `clique` for all `i` in the range of `mid`.
*   The loop variable `i` has reached its final value, which is `mid - 1`.
