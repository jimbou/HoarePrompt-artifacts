According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `mid`. If `mid` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, which may or may not be greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed, `mid` must be greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of integers of length at least right + 1, cliquess is a list of integers of length at least right + 1, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is greater than 0, not_mid is right - left + 1 - mid, and i is 0**
