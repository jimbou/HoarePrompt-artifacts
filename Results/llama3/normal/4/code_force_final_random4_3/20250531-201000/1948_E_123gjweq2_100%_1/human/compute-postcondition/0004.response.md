Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where arr[left + mid - i - 1] is small_element + i, cliquess is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where cliquess[left + i] is clique, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is greater than 0, not_mid is right - left + 1 - mid, and i is 1**

The code block consists of two lines that modify the values of elements in the `arr` and `cliquess` lists. The first line assigns the value of `small_element + i` to the element at index `left + mid - i - 1` in the `arr` list. Since `small_element` is `left + 1` and `i` is 1, the assigned value is `left + 2`. The second line assigns the value of `clique` to the element at index `left + i` in the `cliquess` list. 

After executing the code block, the values of the elements in the `arr` and `cliquess` lists are updated as described above. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
