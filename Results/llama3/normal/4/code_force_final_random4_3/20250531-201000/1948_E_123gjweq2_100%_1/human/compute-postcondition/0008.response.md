According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `not_mid`. If `not_mid` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`. So for the loop to be executed, `not_mid` must be greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers of length at least `right` + 1 where `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `small_element` + `i` for all `i` in range(`mid`), `cliquess` is a list of integers of length at least `right` + 1 where `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for all `i` in range(`mid`), `small_element` is `left` + 1, `big_element` is `right` + 1, `mid` is greater than or equal to 0, `not_mid` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0**
