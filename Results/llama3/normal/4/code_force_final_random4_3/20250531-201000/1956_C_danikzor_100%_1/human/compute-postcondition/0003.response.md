The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, and this is printed: the value of the expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` and the value of the expression `2 * n`, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, this is printed: the value of the expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` and the value of the expression `2 * n`, `i` is 1,  `n` must be greater than 0**
