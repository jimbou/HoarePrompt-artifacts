Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, this is printed: the value of the expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` and the value of the expression `2 * n`, `i` is `n`,  `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, and this is printed: 1, the value of `i` which is `n`, and the values of the range from `n` down to 1 in reverse order (exclusive of 0), where `n` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and this is printed: 2, the value of `i` which is `n`, and the values of the range from `n` down to 1 in reverse order (exclusive of 0).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and the standard input contains multiple test cases minus one test case. The value of the expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` and the value of the expression `2 * n` are printed. The loop variable `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 0. The loop prints two lines for each iteration: one starting with 1, followed by the current value of `i` (which is `n` in the last iteration), and the values of the range from `n` down to 1 in reverse order (exclusive of 0); and another starting with 2, followed by the current value of `i` (which is `n` in the last iteration), and the values of the range from `n` down to 1 in reverse order (exclusive of 0).
