Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing two types of operations: assigning a permutation to a row or a column. The program takes the number of test cases and the size of the matrix as input.

The program correctly calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix, which is the sum of the squares of the first n odd numbers. This is done using the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`.

The program then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, which is 2n. It then prints the operations themselves, which involve assigning a permutation to each row and column. The permutations are generated using the range function with a step of -1, which produces the numbers from n to 1 in reverse order.

The program correctly handles the input and output formats, and it produces the correct output for the given example.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
