Functionality: **The function reads an integer n from standard input, where n is between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and prints the sum of the squares of the first n odd numbers and 2 times n. Then, for each number i from 1 to n, it prints two lines: one starting with 1, followed by i and the numbers from n down to 1 in reverse order (exclusive of 0), and another starting with 2, followed by i and the same sequence of numbers. After processing, the function leaves the input stream with one fewer test case.**
