Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix, but the program does not guarantee to achieve this. The program simply prints the maximum possible sum and the number of operations, but it does not provide a valid solution for the problem.

For example, when n = 3, the program prints:

9 6
1 1 3 2 1
2 1 3 2 1
1 2 3 2 1
2 2 3 2 1
1 3 3 2 1
2 3 3 2 1

However, this solution does not maximize the sum of the numbers in the matrix. A correct solution would be to set the first row to [3, 2, 1], the second row to [2, 3, 1], and the third row to [1, 2, 3], which would result in a sum of 21.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
