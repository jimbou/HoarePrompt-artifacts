The code prints the value 1, the value of `i` which is 1, and the elements of the range from `n` down to 1 (exclusive) in reverse order.

Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), the range will include `n` and all integers down to 1.

Output: **1, 1, [n], [n-1], ..., 2, 1 (where n is an integer between 1 and 500)**
