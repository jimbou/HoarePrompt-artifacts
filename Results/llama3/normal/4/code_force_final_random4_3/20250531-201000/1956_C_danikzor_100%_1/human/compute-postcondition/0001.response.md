The code prints the result of the expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` and `2 * n`. 

Here, `n` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive). The expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` calculates the sum of the squares of the first `n` odd numbers, and `2 * n` calculates twice the value of `n`.

Output: **the sum of the squares of the first n odd numbers, 2 times n (where n is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive)**
