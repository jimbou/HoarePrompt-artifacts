The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, this is printed: the value of the expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` and the value of the expression `2 * n`, `i` is 2,  `n` must be greater than 1, and this is printed: 1, the value of `i` which is 2, and the values of the range from `n` down to 1 in reverse order (exclusive of 0), where `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), and this is printed: 2, the value of `i` which is 2, and the values of the range from `n` down to 1 in reverse order (exclusive of 0)**
