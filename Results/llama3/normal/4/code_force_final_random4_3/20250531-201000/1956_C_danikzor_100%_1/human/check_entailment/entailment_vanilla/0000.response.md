Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing two types of operations: Type 1 operation, which assigns a permutation to a row, and Type 2 operation, which assigns a permutation to a column.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n` and calculates the maximum sum that can be achieved. The formula used is `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`, which is derived from the sum of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the squares of the first `n` natural numbers.

3. The program then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations required, which is `2 * n`.

4. The program then performs the operations. For each row and column, it assigns a permutation of numbers from `n` to `1` in reverse order. This is done to maximize the sum, as the largest numbers are assigned to the positions that contribute the most to the sum.

5. The program prints the operations in the required format.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to be correct. It correctly calculates the maximum sum and performs the operations to achieve this sum.

Correctness: **True**
