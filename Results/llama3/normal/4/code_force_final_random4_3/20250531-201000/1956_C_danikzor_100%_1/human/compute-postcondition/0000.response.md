Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive) because it is assigned the value of the input integer, which is within this range according to the initial state. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case because one test case has been consumed by the `input()` function to assign the value to `n`.
