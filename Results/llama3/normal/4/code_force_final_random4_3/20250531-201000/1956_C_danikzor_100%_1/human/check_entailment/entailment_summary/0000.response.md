Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and provides a solution with no more than 2n operations.

The program first calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix using the formula n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, which is the sum of the squares of the first n odd numbers.

Then, for each number i from 1 to n, it prints two lines: one starting with 1, followed by i and the numbers from n down to 1 in reverse order (exclusive of 0), and another starting with 2, followed by i and the same sequence of numbers. This corresponds to the Type 1 and Type 2 operations described in the problem statement.

The program correctly provides a solution with no more than 2n operations, as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
