Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, and this is printed: the value of the expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` and the value of the expression `2 * n`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
    print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, this is printed: the value of the expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` and the value of the expression `2 * n`, `i` is 1,  `n` must be greater than 0, and this is printed: 1, the value of `i` which is 1, and the values of the range from `n` down to 1 in reverse order (exclusive of 0), where `n` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and this is printed: 2, the value of `i` which is 1, and the values of the range from `n` down to 1 in reverse order (exclusive of 0)

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, this is printed: the value of the expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` and the value of the expression `2 * n`, `i` is 2,  `n` must be greater than 1, and this is printed: 1, the value of `i` which is 2, and the values of the range from `n` down to 1 in reverse order (exclusive of 0), where `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), and this is printed: 2, the value of `i` which is 2, and the values of the range from `n` down to 1 in reverse order (exclusive of 0), and this is printed: 1, the value of `i` which is 2, and the values of the range from `n` down to 1 in reverse order (exclusive of 0), and this is printed: 2, the value of `i` which is 2, and the values of the range from `n` down to 1 in reverse order (exclusive of 0)

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, this is printed: the value of the expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` and the value of the expression `2 * n`, `i` is 3,  `n` must be greater than 2, and this is printed: 1, the value of `i` which is 3, and the values of the range from `n` down to 1 in reverse order (exclusive of 0), where `n` is an integer between 3 and 500 (inclusive), and this is printed: 2, the value of `i` which is 3, and the values of the range from

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
