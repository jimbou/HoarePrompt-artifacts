This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and two binary strings a and b of length n. It then constructs a new string ans by starting with the first character of a and appending characters from a and b based on certain conditions. The function prints the constructed string ans and a counter value, which is either n or n-1 depending on the values of a and b. The function processes all test cases and prints the results for each case.
