Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of either the first character of `a` and either the character at index `i` of `b` if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, or the first character of `a` if `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`, or `b[i]` if `work` is False, and the character at index `i` of `a`. If `work` is True, then `i` is less than `n` and `work` is True if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and `work` is False. If `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, then the character at index `i` of `b` is added to `ans`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and the process is repeated. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the string `ans` is printed. `counter` is 1, `j` is 0. The current value of `j` is such that `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`.**
