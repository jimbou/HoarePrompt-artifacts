Postcondition: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must be at least 2, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string that starts with the first character of `a` and ends with the character at index `n-1` of `a` or `b`, `i` is `n`, `work` is True or False, `counter` is 1, `j` is 0, the value of `ans` is being printed, and `a[j + 1]` is not equal to `b[j]`. Additionally, the current value of `a[j + 1]` is '0' and the current value of `b[j]` is '1'.**
