Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), then two binary strings a_11 a_12 ... a_1n and a_21 a_22 ... a_2n (a_1i and a_2i are either 0 or 1).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    ans = ''
    i = 0
    work = True
    while i < len(a):
        if work:
            ans += a[i]
            if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
                work = False
            elif i + 1 == len(a):
                ans += b[i]
                break
            else:
                i += 1
        else:
            ans += b[i]
            i += 1
    print(ans)
    counter = 1
    for j in range(len(a) - 1):
        if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
            counter += 1
        elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
            counter = 1
        else:
            break
    print(counter)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of either the first character of `a` and either the character at index `i` of `b` if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, or the first character of `a` if `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`, or `b[i]` if `work` is False, and the character at index `i` of `a`. If `work` is True, then `i` is less than `n` and `work` is True if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and `work` is False. If `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, then the character at index `i` of `b` is added to `ans`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and the process is repeated. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the string `ans` is printed. `counter` is either 1 or the length of `a` - 1 and `j` is the length of `a` - 2, and the value of `counter` which is either 1 or the length of `a` - 1 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must be at least 2, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of either the first character of `a` and either the character at index `i` of `b` if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, or the first character of `a` if `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`, or `b[i]` if `work` is False, and the character at index `i` of `a` and the character at index `i` of `a`, `work` is False, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `counter` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is equal to the length of `a` - 1, and the value of `counter` which is greater than or equal to 1 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must be at least 2, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string that starts with the first character of `a` and ends with the character at index `n-1` of `a` or `b`, `i` is `n`, `work` is True or False, `j` is `n-1`, and the value of `ans` is being printed, and the value of `counter` is being printed, where `counter` is either `n` or `n-1` depending on the values of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
