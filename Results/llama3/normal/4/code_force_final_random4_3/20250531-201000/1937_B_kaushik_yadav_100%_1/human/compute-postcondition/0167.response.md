The `print(ans)` statement will print the string `ans`. 

The string `ans` starts with the first character of `a` and ends with the character at index `n-1` of `a` or `b`. 

Since `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must be at least 2, the first character of `a` can be either '0' or '1'. 

The character at index `n-1` of `a` or `b` can also be either '0' or '1'. 

Therefore, the string `ans` will be a binary string that starts with either '0' or '1' and ends with either '0' or '1'.

Output: **a binary string that starts with either '0' or '1' and ends with either '0' or '1'**
