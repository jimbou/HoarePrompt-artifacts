Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must be at least 2, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string that starts with the first character of `a`, `i` is 0, `counter` is greater than or equal to 1, and `work` is True. The current value of `i` plus 1 is less than the length of `a` and the current value of `b` at index `i` is less than the current value of `a` at index `i + 1`***
