Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must be at least 2, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string that starts with the first character of `a`, `i` is 0, `counter` is greater than or equal to 1, and `work` is True. Additionally, either `i + 1` is not less than the length of `a` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`. `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`***
