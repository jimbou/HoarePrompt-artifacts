Postcondition: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must be at least 2, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string that starts with the first character of `a` and ends with the character at index `n-1` of `a` or `b`, `i` is `n`, `work` is True or False, `j` is 1, and the value of `ans` is being printed. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `counter` is 3. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', then `counter` is 3. In all other cases, either `a[j + 1]` is not '0' or `b[j]` is not '1', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, with `counter` remaining 2.**
