Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `n` is greater than `i`, `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must be at least 3, `b` is a binary string of length `n`. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, then `ans` is a string that starts with the first character of `a` and ends with the character at index `i` of `b`, and `i` is less than `n`. Otherwise, if `work` is True, then `ans` is a string that starts with the first character of `a` and ends with the character at index `i + 1` of `a` or `b`, and `i` is less than `n`. If `work` is False, then `ans` is a string of length 1 equal to the first character of `b`, and `i` is 2 or 3. In all cases, `counter` is not printed. `ans` has been appended with the character at index `i` of `a` or `i + 1` of `a`.***
