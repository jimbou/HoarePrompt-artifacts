Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `a` and either the character at index `i` of `b` if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, or the first character of `a` if `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`, `i` is either 0 if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, or 1 if `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`, `work` is True, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Either `i + 1` is not less than the length of `a` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`.***
