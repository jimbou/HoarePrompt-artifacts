Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 3, _ is 2, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, a is a binary string of length n that must be at least 2, b is a binary string of length n, ans is an empty string, i is 0, work is True, and the value of counter which is greater than or equal to 1 is no longer being printed.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must be at least 2, `b` is a binary string of length `n`. If `work` is True, then `ans` is a string that starts with the first character of `a`. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False. Otherwise, if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, then `ans` ends with the character at index `i` of `b`. Otherwise, `i` is 1, `counter` is greater than or equal to 1, and `work` is True. Additionally, either `i + 1` is not less than the length of `a` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`. If `work` is False, then `ans` is a string of length 1 equal to the first character of `b`, `i` is 1, and `counter` is not printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must be at least 3, `b` is a binary string of length `n`. If `work` is True, then `ans` is a string that starts with the first character of `a` and ends with the character at index `i` of `a` or `b`, and `i` is less than `n`. If `work` is False, then `ans` is a string of length 1 equal to the first character of `b`, and `i` is 1. In all cases, `counter` is not printed. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False. Otherwise, if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, then `ans` is a string that starts with the first character of `a` and ends with the character at index `i` of `a`, and `i` is 2. Otherwise, if `work` is True, then `ans` is a string that starts with the first character of `a` and ends with the character at index `i` of `a`. Otherwise, `ans` is a string of length 1 equal to the first character of `b`, and `i` is 2. In all cases, `i` is less than `n`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `n` is greater than `i`, `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must be at least 3, `b` is a binary string of length `n`. If `work` is True, then `ans` is a string that starts with the first character of `a` and ends with the character at index `i` of `a` or `b`, and `i` is less than `n`. If `work` is False, then `ans` is a string of length 1 equal to the first character of `b`, and `i` is 1 or 2. In all cases, `counter` is not printed. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False. Otherwise, if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, then `ans` is a string that starts with the first character of `a` and ends with the character at index `i` of `a`, and `i` is 2. Otherwise, if `work` is True, then `ans` is a string that starts with the first character of `a` and ends with the character at index `i` of `a`. Otherwise, `ans` is a string of length 1 equal to the first character of `b`, and `i` is 2. In all cases, `i` is less than `n`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
