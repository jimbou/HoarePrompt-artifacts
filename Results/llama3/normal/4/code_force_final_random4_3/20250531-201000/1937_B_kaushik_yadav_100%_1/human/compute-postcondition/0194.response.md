Output: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must be at least 2, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string that starts with the first character of `a` and ends with the character at index `n-1` of `a` or `b`, `i` is `n`, `work` is True or False, `j` is `n-1`, and the value of `ans` is being printed, and the value of `counter` is being printed, where `counter` is either `n` or `n-1` depending on the values of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]`.**
