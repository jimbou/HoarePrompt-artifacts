The code `ans += a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the end of string `ans`. 

Since `i` is 0, the first character of string `a` is appended to `ans`. The value of `i` is not changed by this code, so it remains 0. The values of the other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `a`, `i` is 0, `work` is True, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**
