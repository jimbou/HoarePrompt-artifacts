Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n` and the length of `a` is greater than or equal to 2, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of either the first character of `a` and either the character at index `i` of `b` if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, or the first character of `a` if `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`, or `b[i]` if `work` is False, and the character at index `i` of `a` and the character at index `i` of `a`, `work` is either True or False, `i` is less than `n`, and the current value of `i` is either less than the length of `a` - 1 or equal to the length of `a` - 1. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False and the current value of `i` plus 1 is less than the length of `a`, and the current value of `b[i]` is less than the current value of `a[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `work` is True, and either `i + 1` is not less than the length of `a` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`. `counter` is either 1 or the length of `a` - 1 and `j` is the length of `a` - 2, and the value of `counter` which is either 1 or the length of `a` - 1 is being printed. If `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, `ans` has one more character appended to it which is the character at index `i` of `b`, otherwise `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`.***
