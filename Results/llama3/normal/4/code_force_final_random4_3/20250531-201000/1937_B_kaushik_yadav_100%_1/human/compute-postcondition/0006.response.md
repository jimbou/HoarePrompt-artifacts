Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `a`, `i` is 0, `work` is True, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The current value of `i` is less than the length of `a` minus one, and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` in `a`.**
