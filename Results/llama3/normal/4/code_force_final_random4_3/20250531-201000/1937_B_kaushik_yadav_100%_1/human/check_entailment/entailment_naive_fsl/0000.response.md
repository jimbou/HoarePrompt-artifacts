Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input is:

3
2
01
10

The expected output is:

001
2

However, the program outputs:

01
1

The issue is that the program does not correctly handle the case when the first row has a '1' and the second row has a '0' in the same column. The program should choose the '0' from the second row, but it chooses the '1' from the first row instead.
