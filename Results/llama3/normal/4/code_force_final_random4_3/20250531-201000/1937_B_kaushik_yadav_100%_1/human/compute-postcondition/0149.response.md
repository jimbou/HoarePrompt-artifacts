Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must be at least 3, `b` is a binary string of length `n`. If `work` is True, then `ans` is a string that starts with the first character of `a` and ends with the character at index `i` of `a`. Otherwise, `ans` is a string of length 1 equal to the first character of `b`, `i` is 1, and `counter` is not printed, `i` is less than `n`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still at least 3, and the value of `_` is still 2. The length of `a` and `b` is still `n`, which is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5. The string `a` is still a binary string of length `n` that must be at least 3, and `b` is still a binary string of length `n`. If `work` is True, then the string `ans` starts with the first character of `a` and now also ends with the character at index `i` of `a`. If `work` is False, then `ans` is still a string of length 1 equal to the first character of `b`, `i` is still 1, and `counter` is not printed. The value of `i` is still less than `n`.
