Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `a`, `i` is 0, `work` is True, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Either `i + 1` is not less than the length of `a` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`. The current value of `i + 1` equals the length of `a`.**
