Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of either the first character of `a` and either the character at index `i` of `b` if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, or the first character of `a` if `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`, or `b[i]` if `work` is False, and the character at index `i` of `a`. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is True. Otherwise, `i` is less than or equal to `n` and `work` is False. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.***
