Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of either the first character of `a` and either the character at index `i` of `b` if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, or the first character of `a` if `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`, or `b[i]` if `work` is False, and the character at index `i` of `a`. If `work` is True, then `i` is less than `n` and `work` is True if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and `work` is False. If `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, then the character at index `i` of `b` is added to `ans`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and the process is repeated. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the string `ans` is printed. `counter` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(a) - 1):
    if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
        counter += 1
    elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
        counter = 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of either the first character of `a` and either the character at index `i` of `b` if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, or the first character of `a` if `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`, or `b[i]` if `work` is False, and the character at index `i` of `a`. If `work` is True, then `i` is less than `n` and `work` is True if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and `work` is False. If `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, then the character at index `i` of `b` is added to `ans`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and the process is repeated. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the string `ans` is printed. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `counter` is 2 and `j` is 0. Otherwise, `counter` is 1 and `j` is 0, and either `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', or `a[j + 1]` is not equal to '0' or `b[j]` is not equal to '1', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must have at least 3 characters, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of either the first character of `a` and either the character at index `i` of `b` if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, or the first character of `a` if `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`, or `b[i]` if `work` is False, and the character at index `i` of `a`. If `work` is True, then `i` is less than `n` and `work` is True if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and `work` is False. If `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, then the character at index `i` of `b` is added to `ans`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and the process is repeated. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the string `ans` is printed. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `counter` is either 2 or 3 and `j` is 1. Otherwise, `counter` is 1 or 2 and `j` is 1, and either `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', or `a[j + 1]` is not equal to '0' or `b[j]` is not equal to '1', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must have at least 4 characters, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of either the first character of `a` and either the character at index `i` of `b` if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, or the first character of `a` if `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`, or `b[i]` if `work` is False, and the character at index `i` of `a`. If `work` is True, then `i` is less than `n` and `work` is True if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and `work` is False. If `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, then the character at index `i` of `b` is added to `ans`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and the process is repeated. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the string `ans` is printed. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `counter` is either 1, 2, 3 or 4 and `j` is 2. Otherwise, `counter` is 1 or 2 and `j` is 2, and either `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', or `a[j + 1]` is not equal to '0' or `b[j]` is not equal to '1', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
