Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 2, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length n, ans is a string consisting of either the first character of a and either the character at index i of b if i + 1 is equal to the length of a, or the first character of a if i + 1 is not equal to the length of a, or b[i] if work is False, and the character at index i of a. If work is True, then i is less than n and work is True if i + 1 is less than the length of a and b[i] is less than a[i + 1]. Otherwise, i is incremented by 1 and work is False. If i + 1 is equal to the length of a, then the character at index i of b is added to ans. Otherwise, i is incremented by 1 and the process is repeated. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and the string ans is printed. counter is either 1 or the length of a - 1 and j is the length of a - 2, and the value of counter which is either 1 or the length of a - 1 is being printed
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is at least 2, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, a is a binary string of length n and the length of a is greater than or equal to 2, b is a binary string of length n, ans is a string consisting of either the first character of a and either the character at index i of b if i + 1 is equal to the length of a, or the first character of a if i + 1 is not equal to the length of a, or b[i] if work is False, and the character at index i of a and the character at index i of a, work is either True or False, i is less than n, and the current value of i is either less than the length of a - 1 or equal to the length of a - 1. If i + 1 is less than the length of a and b[i] is less than a[i + 1], then work is False and the current value of i plus 1 is less than the length of a, and the current value of b[i] is less than the current value of a[i + 1]. Otherwise, work is True, and either i + 1 is not less than the length of a or b[i] is not less than a[i + 1]. counter is either 1 or the length of a - 1 and j is the length of a - 2, and the value of counter which is either 1 or the length of a - 1 is being printed. If i + 1 is equal to the length of a, ans has one more character appended to it which is the character at index i of b, otherwise i + 1 is not equal to the length of a. If work is False, then i is incremented by 1. Otherwise, work is True.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *_t is at least 2, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, a is a binary string of length n and the length of a is greater than or equal to 2, b is a binary string of length n, ans is a string consisting of either the first character of a and either the character at index i of b if i + 1 is equal to the length of a, or the first character of a if i + 1 is not equal to the length of a, or b[i] if work is False, and the character at index i of a and the character at index i of a, work is either True or False, i is less than the length of a, and the current value of i is either less than the length of a or equal to the length of a, counter is either 1 or the length of a - 1 and j is the length of a - 2, and the value of counter which is either 1 or the length of a - 1 is being printed. If i + 1 is equal to the length of a, ans has one more character appended to it which is the character at index i of b, otherwise i + 1 is not equal to the length of a. If work is True, then the character at index i of a is appended to ans. Otherwise, if work is False, then i is incremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *_t is at least 2, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, a is a binary string of length n and the length of a is greater than or equal to 2, b is a binary string of length n, ans is a string consisting of either the first character of a and either the character at index i of b if i + 1 is equal to the length of a, or the first character of a if i + 1 is not equal to the length of a, or b[i] if work is False, and the character at index i of a and the character at index i of a, work is either True or False, i is less than the length of a, and the current value of i is less than the length of a, counter is either 1 or the length of a - 1 and j is the length of a - 2, and the value of counter which is either 1 or the length of a - 1 is being printed. If i + 1 is equal to the length of a, ans has one more character appended to it which is the character at index i of b, otherwise i + 1 is not equal to the length of a. If work is True, then the character at index i of a is appended to ans. Otherwise, if work is False, then i is incremented by 1. If i + 1 is equal to the length of a and b[i] < a[i + 1], then work is set to False. Otherwise, if i + 1 is equal to the length of a and b[i] >= a[i + 1], then the character at index i of b is appended to ans, otherwise i is incremented by 1. If work is False, then i is incremented by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
