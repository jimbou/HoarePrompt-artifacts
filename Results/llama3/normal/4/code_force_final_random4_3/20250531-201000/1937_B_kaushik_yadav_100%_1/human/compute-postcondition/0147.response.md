Postcondition: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must be at least 2, `b` is a binary string of length `n`. If `work` is True, then `ans` is a string that starts with the first character of `a`. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False. Otherwise, if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, then `ans` ends with the character at index `i` of `b`. Otherwise, `i` is 1, `counter` is greater than or equal to 1, and `work` is True. Additionally, either `i + 1` is not less than the length of `a` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`. If `work` is False, then `ans` is a string of length 1 equal to the first character of `b`, `i` is 1, and `counter` is not printed.**
