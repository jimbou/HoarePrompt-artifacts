Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of either the first character of `a` and either the character at index `i` of `b` if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, or the first character of `a` if `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`, or `b[i]` if `work` is False, and the character at index `i` of `a`, `i` is less than `n`, `work` is True, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `work` has been changed to True, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The length of `a` and `b` is still `n`, and `ans` still consists of a combination of characters from `a` and `b` based on the value of `i` and the previous value of `work`. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by one.
