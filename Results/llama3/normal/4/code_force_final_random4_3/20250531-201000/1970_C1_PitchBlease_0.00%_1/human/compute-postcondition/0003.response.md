Postcondition: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `queue` is an empty deque, `visited` is a set containing the start node, and `dist` is 0. The current value of `current` is equal to `target`, which is also equal to the initial value of `start`.**
