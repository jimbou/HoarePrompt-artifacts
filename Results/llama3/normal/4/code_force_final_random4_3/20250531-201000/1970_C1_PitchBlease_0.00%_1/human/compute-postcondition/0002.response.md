The code removes the leftmost element from the queue and assigns it to the variables `current` and `dist`. Since the queue initially contains a tuple of the start node and 0, `current` is assigned the value of `start` and `dist` is assigned the value of 0. The queue is now empty.

Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `queue` is an empty deque, `visited` is a set containing the start node, `current` is equal to `start`, and `dist` is 0.**
