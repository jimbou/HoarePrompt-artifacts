#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function determines the winner of a game played on a tree with n nodes, where the game starts at a specified node. It takes as input the number of nodes, a list of edges representing the tree, and the starting node. The function returns a string indicating the winner, either 'Ron' or 'Hermione', based on the parity of the distances from the starting node to the two leaves of the tree.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers representing nodes in the tree, tree is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, and start and target are both keys in the tree dictionary.

    #State: `start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `queue` is an empty deque, `visited` is a set containing all nodes in the tree, `current` is equal to `target`, `dist` is the shortest distance from `start` to `target`, and the function returns `dist`.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating that the shortest distance from the start node to the target node is not found.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the shortest distance between two nodes in a tree. It takes as input a start node, a target node, and a tree represented as a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes. The function returns the shortest distance from the start node to the target node if it exists, otherwise it returns -1.
