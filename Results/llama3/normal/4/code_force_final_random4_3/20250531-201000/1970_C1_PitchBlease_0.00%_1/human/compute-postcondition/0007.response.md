Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `queue` is a deque with at least one element less than before, `visited` is a set containing the start node, `current` is the first element that was in `queue`, `dist` is the second element that was in `queue`, and `current` is not equal to `target`**

In this output state, the value of `current` is updated to be the first element that was in the `queue`, and the value of `dist` is updated to be the second element that was in the `queue`. The `queue` now has at least one element less than before, since we removed the first element. The other variables remain unchanged.
