Output State: **The program returns -1, indicating that the shortest distance from the start node to the target node is not found.**

In this case, the program returns -1, which typically indicates that the target node is not reachable from the start node, or the algorithm was unable to find a path between them. The variables `start`, `target`, `tree`, `queue`, `visited`, and `current` are not affected by this return statement, and their values remain unchanged. The `dist` variable, which is supposed to hold the shortest distance from `start` to `target`, is not used in this return statement, and its value is not returned.
