Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `queue` is a non-empty deque with one less element, `visited` is a set containing the start node, `current` is the node that was at the front of the queue, `dist` is the distance of the current node from the start node.**

In this output state, the code has removed the front element from the queue and assigned its value to the variables `current` and `dist`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The queue now has one less element, and the current node and its distance from the start node are now stored in the variables `current` and `dist`, respectively.
