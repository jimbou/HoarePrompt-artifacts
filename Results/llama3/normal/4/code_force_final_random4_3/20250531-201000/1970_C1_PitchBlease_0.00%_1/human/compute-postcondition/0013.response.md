Postcondition: ***`start`, `target`, `dist` are integers, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `queue` is a non-empty deque with one less element, `visited` is a set containing the start node. If the current node is the target node, the program returns the distance of the current node from the start node, which is the distance of the node that was at the front of the queue from the start node in the tree.***
