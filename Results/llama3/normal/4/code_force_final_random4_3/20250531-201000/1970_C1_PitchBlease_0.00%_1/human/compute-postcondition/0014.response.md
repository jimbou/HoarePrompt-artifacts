Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `queue` is an empty deque, `visited` is a set containing all nodes in the tree, `current` is equal to `target`, `dist` is the shortest distance from `start` to `target`, and the function returns `dist`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the queue is empty, all nodes in the tree have been visited, and the function returns the shortest distance from the start node to the target node.
