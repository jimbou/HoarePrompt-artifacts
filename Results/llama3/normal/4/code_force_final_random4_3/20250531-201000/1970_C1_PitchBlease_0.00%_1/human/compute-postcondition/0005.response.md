Postcondition: ***`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `queue` is an empty deque, `visited` is a set containing the start node, `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, and `current` is not equal to `target`***
