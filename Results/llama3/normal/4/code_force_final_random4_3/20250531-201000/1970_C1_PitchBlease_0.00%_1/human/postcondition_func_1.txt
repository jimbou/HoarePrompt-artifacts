This function calculates the shortest distance between two nodes in a tree. It takes as input a start node, a target node, and a tree represented as a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes. The function returns the shortest distance from the start node to the target node if it exists, otherwise it returns -1.
