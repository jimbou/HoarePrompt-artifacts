Functionality: This function determines the winner of a game played on a tree with n nodes, where the game starts at a specified node. It takes as input the number of nodes, a list of edges representing the tree, and the starting node. The function returns a string indicating the winner, either 'Ron' or 'Hermione', based on the parity of the distances from the starting node to the two leaves of the tree.
