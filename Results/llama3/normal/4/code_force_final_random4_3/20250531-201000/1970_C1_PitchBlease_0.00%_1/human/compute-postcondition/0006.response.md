The only variable in the loop head is variable queue, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable queue.  If queue is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, queue is an empty deque, So for the loop to be executed one more time the queue needed to have at least one element.
State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `queue` is a deque with at least one element, `visited` is a set containing the start node, `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, and `current` is not equal to `target`**
