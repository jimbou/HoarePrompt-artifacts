Output State: **start and target are integers representing nodes in the tree, tree is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, queue is a deque containing a tuple of the start node and 0, and visited is a set containing the start node.**

The code initializes a queue with a tuple containing the start node and 0, and a set containing the start node. The start node is an integer representing a node in the tree, and the tree is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes. The target node is also an integer representing a node in the tree. The queue and visited set are initialized with the start node, indicating that the start node has been visited and is the starting point for further exploration.
