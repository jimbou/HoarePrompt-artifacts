The variable in the loop head is variable queue, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable queue.  If queue is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, queue is a deque with at least one element less than before, So for the loop to be executed one more time queue must not be empty.
State: **`start`, `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `queue` is a non-empty deque, `visited` is a set containing the start node.**
