Postcondition: ***`start`, `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `queue` is a deque with at least one element less than before, `visited` is a set containing the start node. If `current` is equal to `target`, the program returns the distance from the start node to the current node, which is the second element that was in the queue. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
