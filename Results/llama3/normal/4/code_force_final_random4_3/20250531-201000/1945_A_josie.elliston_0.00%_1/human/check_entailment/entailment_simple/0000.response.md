Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate participants in a hike, considering their preferences for living alone, with one other person, or with two others.

Function 1 (`func_1`) takes two parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`, which are non-negative integers. It first checks if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3. If it's not, it checks if the sum of the remainder of extroverts modulo 3 and universals is less than 3. If it is, the function returns `None`, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3.

Function 2 (`func_2`) takes three parameters, `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`, which are non-negative integers. It calls `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments and stores the result in the variable `ret`. If `ret` is `None`, it returns -1, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants. Otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and `ret`.

The program iterates over a set of test cases, where each test case is a line containing three integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. For each test case, it calls `func_2` with the corresponding values and prints the result.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases:

* If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, it checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots. If not, it returns -1.
* If the number of extroverts is divisible by 3, it simply returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3.
* If there are introverts, it adds their number to the result of `func_1` to get the total number of tents needed.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is:

Correctness: **True**
