Reasoning: 

The problem requires determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. The given program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_1 calculates the minimum number of groups that can be formed with a given number of extroverts and universals. It correctly handles the cases where the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and the sum of extroverts modulo 3 and universals is less than 3, returning None in such cases. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which represents the minimum number of groups that can be formed.

func_2 takes three non-negative integers (introverts, extroverts, and universals) as input and returns either -1 or the sum of introverts and the result of func_1 called with extroverts and universals as arguments. This function correctly handles the cases where func_1 returns None, returning -1 in such cases. Otherwise, it returns the sum of introverts and the result of func_1, which represents the minimum number of tents needed.

The execution summaries of the functions demonstrate that they work correctly for various inputs. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
