Functionality: **This function calculates the minimum number of groups that can be formed with a given number of extroverts and universals. It takes two non-negative integers, extroverts and universals, as input. If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and the sum of extroverts modulo 3 and universals is less than 3, the function returns None. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which represents the minimum number of groups that can be formed.**
