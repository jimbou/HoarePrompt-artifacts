#State of the program right berfore the function call: extroverts and universals are non-negative integers.
    if (extroverts % 3 != 0) :
        if (extroverts % 3 + universals < 3) :

            #The program returns None

    #State: *extroverts and universals are non-negative integers. If the current value of extroverts is not divisible by 3, the sum of extroverts modulo 3 and universals is larger than or equal to 3
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
    #The program returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3, where extroverts and universals are non-negative integers and if the current value of extroverts is not divisible by 3, the sum of extroverts modulo 3 and universals is larger than or equal to 3.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the minimum number of groups that can be formed with a given number of extroverts and universals. It takes two non-negative integers, extroverts and universals, as input. If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and the sum of extroverts modulo 3 and universals is less than 3, the function returns None. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which represents the minimum number of groups that can be formed.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: introverts, extroverts, and universals are non-negative integers.
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret
    #The program returns either -1 or the sum of introverts and the value returned by func_1(extroverts, universals). The value returned by func_1(extroverts, universals) is stored in the variable ret, and introverts, extroverts, and universals are non-negative integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes three non-negative integers (introverts, extroverts, and universals) as input and returns either -1 or the sum of introverts and the result of another function (func_1) called with extroverts and universals as arguments.
