Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate participants in a hike, given the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. The problem description specifies the conditions for each type of participant.

Function 1 calculates the minimum number of groups that can be formed with a given number of extroverts and universals. It correctly handles the case where the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and the sum of extroverts modulo 3 and universals is less than 3, returning None in this case. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which represents the minimum number of groups that can be formed.

Function 2 takes three non-negative integers (introverts, extroverts, and universals) as input and returns either -1 or the sum of introverts and the result of Function 1 called with extroverts and universals as arguments. If Function 1 returns None, Function 2 returns -1, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the participants according to their preferences. Otherwise, it returns the sum of introverts and the result of Function 1, which represents the minimum number of tents needed.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and returns the expected output for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
