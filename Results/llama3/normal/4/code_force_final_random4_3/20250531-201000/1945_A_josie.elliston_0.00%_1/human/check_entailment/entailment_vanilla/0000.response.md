Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate participants in a hike, considering their preferences for living alone or with others.

Function 1, `func_1`, takes the number of extroverts and universals as input and returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate them. It first checks if the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3. If it's not, it checks if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) plus the number of universals is less than 3. If this condition is true, it means that it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals together, so the function returns `None`. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of tents needed by dividing the total number of extroverts and universals by 3 and rounding up to the nearest integer using the `ceil` function.

Function 2, `func_2`, takes the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals as input and returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants. It first calls `func_1` to get the minimum number of tents needed for the extroverts and universals. If `func_1` returns `None`, it means that it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals together, so `func_2` returns -1. Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result of `func_1` to get the total minimum number of tents needed.

The program correctly handles the cases where it's impossible to accommodate the participants according to their preferences, and it correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed in all other cases.

Correctness: **True**
