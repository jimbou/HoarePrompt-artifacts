Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, s is a positive integer, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n positive integers, sp is a positive integer, bp is a positive integer, bm is a positive integer, sm is a positive integer.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains 0 as it is not modified by the code. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1 as one test case is read by the code. The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are updated to the values read from stdin. The lists `p` and `a` are updated to the values read from stdin. The values of `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` are calculated based on the values of `a`, `b`, `s`, and `k`.
