Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than n+1, i is 0, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is a positive integer greater than 0, k is an integer minus 1, b is a positive integer equal to p[b] - 2, s is a positive integer equal to p[s] - 2, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n positive integers, sp is a positive integer equal to a[s], bp is a positive integer equal to a[b], bm is a positive integer equal to a[b] * (k-1), sm is a positive integer equal to a[s] * k**

The code decrements the value of k by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The value of bm is updated to a[b] * (k-1) because bm is equal to a[b] * k and k has been decremented by 1.
