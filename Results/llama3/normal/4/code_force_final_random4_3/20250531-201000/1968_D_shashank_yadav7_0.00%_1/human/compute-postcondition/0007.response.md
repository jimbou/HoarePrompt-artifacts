Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `b` is a positive integer, `s` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `sp` is a positive integer, `bp` is a positive integer, `bm` is a positive integer, `sm` is a positive integer. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.**
