Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than n+1, i is n+1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is a positive integer, k is an integer, b is a positive integer equal to p[b] - 2, s is a positive integer equal to p[s] - 2, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n positive integers, sp is a positive integer equal to a[s], bp is a positive integer equal to a[b], bm is a positive integer equal to a[b] * k, sm is a positive integer equal to a[s] * k**

The code reads two lines from stdin, containing four integers and n integers respectively, leaving t-4 test cases in stdin. It then updates the values of n, k, b, and s based on the input. The values of b and s are decremented by 1. The code also initializes sp, bp, bm, and sm based on the values of a, b, s, and k. The initial values of t, i, p, and a remain unchanged.
