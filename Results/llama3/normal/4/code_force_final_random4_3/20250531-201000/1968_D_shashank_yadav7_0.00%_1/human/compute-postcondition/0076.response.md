The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than n+2, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `stdin` contains t-6 test cases, `b` is a positive integer equal to p[p[p[b] - 1] - 1] - 1, `s` is a positive integer equal to p[p[p[s] - 1] - 1] - 1, `p` is a list of n integers, `a` is a list of n positive integers, `sp` is a positive integer equal to a[s] + a[p[s] - 1] + a[p[p[s] - 1] - 1], `bp` is a positive integer equal to a[b] + a[p[b] - 1] + a[p[p[b] - 1] - 1], `bm` is a positive integer equal to max(0, a[p[p[b] - 1] - 1] * (k-1) + a[p[b] - 1] + a[b] * k + bp), `sm` is a positive integer equal to max(0, a[p[p[s] - 1] - 1] * (k-1) + a[p[s] - 1] + a[s] * k + sp)**
