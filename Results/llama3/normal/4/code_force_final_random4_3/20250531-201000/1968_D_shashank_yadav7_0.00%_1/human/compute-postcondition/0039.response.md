Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than n+1, i is 0, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is a positive integer greater than 0, b is a positive integer equal to p[b] - 1, s is a positive integer equal to p[s] - 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n positive integers, sp is a positive integer equal to a[s] + a[s], bp is a positive integer equal to a[b] + a[b], bm is a positive integer equal to max(bm, a[b] * k + a[b]), sm is a positive integer equal to max(sm, a[s] * k + a[s])**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The code modifies the values of `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm`. The value of `b` is updated to `p[b] - 1`, and the value of `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`. The value of `sp` is incremented by `a[s]`, and the value of `bp` is incremented by `a[b]`. The value of `bm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[b] * k + a[b]`, and the value of `sm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[s] * k + a[s]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
