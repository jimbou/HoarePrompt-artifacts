The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, i is 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is a positive integer greater than 1, b is a positive integer equal to p[b] - 1, s is a positive integer equal to p[s] - 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n positive integers, sp is a positive integer equal to sp + a[s], bp is a positive integer equal to bp + a[b], bm is a positive integer equal to bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp), sm is a positive integer equal to sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp), k is 0 or not 0.**
