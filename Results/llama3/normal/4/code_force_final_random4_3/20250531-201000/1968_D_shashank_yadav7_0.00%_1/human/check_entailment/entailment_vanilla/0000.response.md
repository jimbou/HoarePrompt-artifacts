Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the "Permutation game" problem. The program takes input for the number of test cases, the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha. It then reads in the permutation and the array of scores.

The program calculates the maximum score that Bodya and Sasha can achieve by staying at their current position or moving to the next position in the permutation. It does this by iterating through the permutation and updating the maximum score for each player.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. The program does not correctly calculate the maximum score for each player. The line `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` is incorrect because it adds the maximum score to the current score, but it should only update the maximum score if the new score is higher.

2. The program does not correctly handle the case where the game lasts for more than `n` turns, where `n` is the length of the permutation. In this case, the players will start to repeat their moves, and the program should take this into account when calculating the maximum score.

3. The program does not correctly handle the case where the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha are the same. In this case, the program will enter an infinite loop because it will keep updating the same position.

4. The program does not correctly handle the case where the permutation contains cycles. In this case, the program will enter an infinite loop because it will keep updating the same positions.

5. The program does not correctly handle the case where the array of scores contains zeros. In this case, the program will not correctly calculate the maximum score.

6. The program does not correctly handle the case where the duration of the game is zero. In this case, the program will not correctly calculate the maximum score.

7. The program does not correctly handle the case where the length of the permutation is zero. In this case, the program will not correctly calculate the maximum score.

8. The program does not correctly handle the case where the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha are out of range. In this case, the program will not correctly calculate the maximum score.

9. The program does not correctly handle the case where the permutation is not a valid permutation. In this case, the program will not correctly calculate the maximum score.

10. The program does not correctly handle the case where the array of scores is not a valid array of scores. In this case, the program will not correctly calculate the maximum score.

Due to these issues, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
