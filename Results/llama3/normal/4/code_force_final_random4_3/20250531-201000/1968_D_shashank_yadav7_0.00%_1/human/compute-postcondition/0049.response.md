Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than n+1, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, n is a positive integer greater than 2, b is a positive integer equal to p[p[b] - 1] - 1, s is a positive integer equal to p[p[s] - 1] - 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n positive integers, sp is a positive integer equal to a[p[s] - 1] + a[p[s] - 1] + a[p[s] - 1], bp is a positive integer equal to a[p[b] - 1] + a[p[b] - 1] + a[p[b] - 1], bm is a positive integer equal to max(bm, a[p[b] - 1] * (k-1) + a[p[b] - 1] + a[p[b] - 1] * (k-1) + a[p[b] - 1] + a[p[b] - 1]), sm is a positive integer equal to max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * (k-1) + a[p[s] - 1] + a[p[s] - 1] * (k-1) + a[p[s] - 1] + a[p[s] - 1]), k is a positive integer decreased by 1. If k is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the remaining test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `b` and `s` have been updated based on the values of `p[b]` and `p[s]`, respectively. The values of `sp` and `bp` have been incremented by the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]`, respectively. The values of `bm` and `sm` have been updated based on the maximum of their current values and the calculated expressions involving `a[b]`, `a[s]`, `k`, `bp`, and `sp`. The value of `k` has been decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
