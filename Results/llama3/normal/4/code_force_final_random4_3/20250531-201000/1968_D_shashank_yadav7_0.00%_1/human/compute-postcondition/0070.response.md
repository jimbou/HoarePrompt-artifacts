Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than n+2, i is 0, n is greater than 0, stdin contains t-6 test cases, b is a positive integer equal to p[p[b] - 1] - 1, s is a positive integer equal to p[p[s] - 1] - 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n positive integers, sp is a positive integer equal to a[s] + a[p[s] - 1], bp is a positive integer equal to a[b] + a[p[b] - 1], bm is a positive integer equal to max(0, a[p[b] - 1] * k + a[b]), sm is a positive integer equal to max(0, a[p[s] - 1] * k + a[s]).**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `stdin` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The values of `b` and `s` are updated based on the values of `p[b]` and `p[s]`, respectively. The values of `sp` and `bp` are incremented by the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]`, respectively. The values of `bm` and `sm` are updated based on the maximum of their current values and the product of `a[b]` or `a[s]` with `k`, plus the values of `bp` and `sp`, respectively.
