Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than n+1, i is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is a positive integer greater than 2, b is a positive integer equal to p[b] - 1, s is a positive integer equal to p[s] - 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n positive integers, sp is a positive integer equal to a[s] + a[s] + a[s], bp is a positive integer equal to a[b] + a[b] + a[b], bm is a positive integer equal to max(bm, a[b] * (k-2) + a[b] + a[b] * (k-1) + a[b] + a[b]), sm is a positive integer equal to max(sm, a[s] * (k-2) + a[s] + a[s] * (k-1) + a[s] + a[s]), k is a positive integer decreased by 1**

In this output state, the value of k has been decreased by 1, which affects the values of bm and sm. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-4 test cases, and the lists p and a remain the same. The values of b, s, sp, and bp are still equal to their respective expressions.
