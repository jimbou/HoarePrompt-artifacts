Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `b` is a positive integer equal to `p[b] - 1`, `s` is a positive integer equal to `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `sp` is a positive integer equal to `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is a positive integer equal to `bp + a[b]`, `bm` is a positive integer equal to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is a positive integer equal to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `k` is -1 or not -1. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `b`, `s`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, `sm`, and `k`.***
