Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `b` is a positive integer equal to `p[b] - 1`, `s` is a positive integer equal to `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `sp` is a positive integer equal to `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is a positive integer equal to `bp + a[b]`, `bm` is a positive integer equal to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is a positive integer equal to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `k` is -1 or not -1.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been decremented by 1, so it can be either -1 (if it was 0 initially) or still not -1 (if it was not 0 initially). All other variables remain unchanged.
