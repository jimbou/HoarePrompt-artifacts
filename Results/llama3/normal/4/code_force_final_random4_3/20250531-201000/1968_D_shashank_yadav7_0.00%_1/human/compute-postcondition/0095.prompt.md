Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains four integers n, k, P_B, P_S, followed by two lists of n integers p and a. n, k, P_B, P_S are positive integers, 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^9, 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n. p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n. a is a list of positive integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b -= 1
    s -= 1
    sp = a[s]
    bp = a[b]
    bm = a[b] * k
    sm = a[s] * k
    for i in range(n):
        k -= 1
        if k == 0:
            break
        b = p[b] - 1
        s = p[s] - 1
        bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
        sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
        sp += a[s]
        bp += a[b]
    if bm > sm:
        print('Bodya')
    elif bm < sm:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, i is n, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is a positive integer, b is a positive integer equal to p[b] - 1, s is a positive integer equal to p[s] - 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n positive integers, sp is a positive integer equal to sp + a[s] * n, bp is a positive integer equal to bp + a[b] * n, bm is a positive integer equal to bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp), sm is a positive integer equal to sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp), k is -n+1 or not -n+1. If bm is greater than sm, 'Bodya' is printed. If bm is less than sm, 'Sasha' is printed. If bm is equal to sm, 'Draw' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than n+1, i is n, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is a positive integer, b is a positive integer equal to p[b] - 1, s is a positive integer equal to p[s] - 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n positive integers, sp is a positive integer equal to a[s] + a[s] + ... + a[s] (n times), bp is a positive integer equal to a[b] + a[b] + ... + a[b] (n times), bm is a positive integer equal to max(bm, a[b] * (k-1) + a[b] + a[b] * (k-2) + a[b] + ... + a[b] * 1 + a[b] + a[b]), sm is a positive integer equal to max(sm, a[s] * (k-1) + a[s] + a[s] * (k-2) + a[s] + ... + a[s] * 1 + a[s] + a[s]), k is 0. If bm is greater than sm, 'Bodya' is printed. If bm is less than sm, 'Sasha' is printed. If bm is greater than or equal to sm, 'Draw' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than n+2, i is 0, stdin contains t-6 test cases, n is a positive integer, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n positive integers, b is a positive integer equal to p[p[p...[p[b] - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1, s is a positive integer equal to p[p[p...[p[s] - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1, sp is a positive integer equal to a[s] + a[p[s] - 1] + a[p[p[s] - 1] - 1] + ... + a[p[p...[p[s] - 1]], bp is a positive integer equal to a[b] + a[p[b] - 1] + a[p[p[b] - 1] - 1] + ... + a[p[p...[p[b] - 1]], bm is a positive integer equal to max(0, a[p[p...[p[b] - 1] - 1]] * (k-n+1) + a[p[p...[p[b] - 1] - 1]] + ... + a[p[b] - 1] * (k-1) + bp), sm is a positive integer equal to max(0, a[p[p...[p[s] - 1] - 1]] * (k-n+1) + a[p[p...[p[s] - 1] - 1]] + ... + a[p[s] - 1] * (k-1) + sp), k is -n+1. If bm is greater than sm, the string 'Bodya' is printed. Otherwise, either 'Sasha' is printed if bm is less than sm or 'Draw' is printed if bm is greater than or equal to sm.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
