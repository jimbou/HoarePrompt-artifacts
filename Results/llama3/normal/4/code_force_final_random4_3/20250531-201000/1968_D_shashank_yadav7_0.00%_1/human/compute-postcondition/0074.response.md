Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than n+2, i is 1, n is greater than 1, stdin contains t-6 test cases, b is a positive integer equal to p[p[b] - 1] - 1, s is a positive integer equal to p[p[s] - 1] - 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n positive integers, sp is a positive integer equal to a[s] + a[p[s] - 1], bp is a positive integer equal to a[b] + a[p[b] - 1], bm is a positive integer equal to max(0, a[p[b] - 1] * (k-1) + a[b]), sm is a positive integer equal to max(0, a[p[s] - 1] * (k-1) + a[s]). If k is equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
