Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the string 'Bodya'.

The variables and objects in the precondition are not relevant to the print statement, as it simply prints a fixed string. The values of t, i, n, p, a, b, s, sp, bp, bm, sm, and k do not affect the output of the print statement.

Output: **Bodya**
