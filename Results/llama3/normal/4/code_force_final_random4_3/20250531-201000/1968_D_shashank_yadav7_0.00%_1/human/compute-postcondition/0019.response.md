Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, i is n, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is a positive integer, b is a positive integer equal to p[b] - 1, s is a positive integer equal to p[s] - 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n positive integers, sp is a positive integer equal to sp + a[s] * n, bp is a positive integer equal to bp + a[b] * n, bm is a positive integer equal to bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp), sm is a positive integer equal to sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp), k is -n+1 or not -n+1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will execute n times, and after each iteration, the values of b, s, sp, bp, bm, and sm will be updated based on the values of p, a, and k. The value of k will decrease by 1 in each iteration, and the loop will break if k becomes 0. The final state of the variables will depend on the initial values of p, a, and k, as well as the number of iterations n.
