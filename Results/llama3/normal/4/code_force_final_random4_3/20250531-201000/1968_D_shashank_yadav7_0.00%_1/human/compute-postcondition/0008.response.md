Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is a positive integer greater than 0, b is a positive integer equal to p[b] - 1, s is a positive integer equal to p[s] - 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n positive integers, sp is a positive integer equal to sp + a[s], bp is a positive integer equal to bp + a[b], bm is a positive integer equal to bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp), sm is a positive integer equal to sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp), k is 0 or not 0.**

In this output state, the values of `b` and `s` have been updated based on the values of `p[b]` and `p[s]`, respectively. The values of `sp` and `bp` have been incremented by the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]`, respectively. The values of `bm` and `sm` have been updated based on the maximum of their current values and the values of `a[b] * k + bp` and `a[s] * k + sp`, respectively. The value of `k` remains unchanged, but its value determines whether the program continues execution or breaks out of the loop. All other variables remain unchanged.
