Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains four integers n, k, P_B, P_S, followed by two lists of n integers p and a. n, k, P_B, P_S are positive integers, 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^9, 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n. p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n. a is a list of positive integers.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is a positive integer, which is the number of test cases. The stdin still contains the same information as before, but now we have a variable `t` that holds the number of test cases. The rest of the information remains the same, with each test case containing four integers and two lists of integers.
