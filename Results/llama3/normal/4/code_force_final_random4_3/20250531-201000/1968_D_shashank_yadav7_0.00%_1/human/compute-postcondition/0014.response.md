The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 3 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 3.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, i is 3, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is a positive integer greater than 3, b is a positive integer equal to p[p[b] - 1] - 1, s is a positive integer equal to p[p[s] - 1] - 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n positive integers, sp is a positive integer equal to sp + a[p[s] - 1] + a[s], bp is a positive integer equal to bp + a[p[b] - 1] + a[b], bm is a positive integer equal to bm + max(bm, a[p[b] - 1] * k + bp + a[b]), sm is a positive integer equal to sm + max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * k + sp + a[s]), k is -1 or not -1.**
