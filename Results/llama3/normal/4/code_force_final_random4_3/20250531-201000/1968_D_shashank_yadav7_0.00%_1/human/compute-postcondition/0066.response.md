Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than n+2, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `stdin` contains t-6 test cases, `b` is a positive integer equal to p[b] - 1, `s` is a positive integer equal to p[s] - 1, `p` is a list of n integers, `a` is a list of n positive integers, `sp` is a positive integer equal to a[s], `bp` is a positive integer equal to a[b], `bm` is a positive integer equal to a[b] * 0, `sm` is a positive integer equal to a[s] * 0, `k` is -1**

The value of `k` is decremented by 1, resulting in `k` being -1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
