Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than n+1, i is 0, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is a positive integer greater than 0, b is a positive integer equal to p[b] - 2, s is a positive integer equal to p[s] - 2, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n positive integers, sp is a positive integer equal to a[s], bp is a positive integer equal to a[b]. If k is 0, then bm is 0, sm is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, bm is a positive integer equal to a[b] * (k-1), sm is a positive integer equal to a[s] * k***
