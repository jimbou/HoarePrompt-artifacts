According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n+1`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than n+2, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `stdin` contains t-6 test cases, `b` is a positive integer equal to p[b] - 1, `s` is a positive integer equal to p[s] - 1, `p` is a list of n integers, `a` is a list of n positive integers, `sp` is a positive integer equal to a[s], `bp` is a positive integer equal to a[b], `bm` is a positive integer equal to a[b] * 0, `sm` is a positive integer equal to a[s] * 0, `k` is 0**
