Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `i` is 2, stdin contains `t-5` test cases, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `b` is a positive integer equal to `p[b] - 1`, `s` is a positive integer equal to `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `sp` is a positive integer equal to `a[s] + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is a positive integer equal to `a[b] + a[b] + a[b]`, `bm` is a positive integer equal to `max(bm, a[b] * (k-2) + a[b] + a[b] * (k-1) + a[b] + a[b])`, `sm` is a positive integer equal to `max(sm, a[s] * (k-2) + a[s] + a[s] * (k-1) + a[s] + a[s])`, `k` is a positive integer decreased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain the same, and the stdin contains one less test case.
