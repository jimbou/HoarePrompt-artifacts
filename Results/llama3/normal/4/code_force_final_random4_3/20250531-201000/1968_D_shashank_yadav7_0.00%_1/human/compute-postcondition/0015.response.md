Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, i is 3, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is a positive integer greater than 3, b is a positive integer equal to p[p[b] - 1] - 1, s is a positive integer equal to p[p[s] - 1] - 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n positive integers, sp is a positive integer equal to sp + a[p[s] - 1] + a[s], bp is a positive integer equal to bp + a[p[b] - 1] + a[b], bm is a positive integer equal to bm + max(bm, a[p[b] - 1] * k + bp + a[b]), sm is a positive integer equal to sm + max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * k + sp + a[s]), k is -2 or not -2.**

The code decreases the value of k by 1. The value of k was either -1 or not -1, so now it is either -2 or not -2. The states of the other variables are not affected.
