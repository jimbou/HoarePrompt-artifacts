Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than n+2, i is 1, n is greater than 1, stdin contains t-6 test cases, b is a positive integer equal to p[p[p[b] - 1] - 1] - 1, s is a positive integer equal to p[p[p[s] - 1] - 1] - 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n positive integers, sp is a positive integer equal to a[s] + a[p[s] - 1] + a[p[p[s] - 1] - 1], bp is a positive integer equal to a[b] + a[p[b] - 1] + a[p[p[b] - 1] - 1], bm is a positive integer equal to max(0, a[p[p[b] - 1] - 1] * (k-1) + a[p[b] - 1] + a[b] * k + bp), sm is a positive integer equal to max(0, a[p[p[s] - 1] - 1] * (k-1) + a[p[s] - 1] + a[s] * k + sp).**

The code updates the values of `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` based on the previous values of these variables and the values of `p`, `a`, and `k`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged. The updated values of `b` and `s` are used to calculate the new values of `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp`, which are then updated accordingly.
