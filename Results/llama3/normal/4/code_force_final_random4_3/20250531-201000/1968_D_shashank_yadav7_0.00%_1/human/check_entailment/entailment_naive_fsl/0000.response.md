Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the game logic. The issue lies in the way it calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. The program uses a greedy approach, always choosing the maximum score between the current position and the next position. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the fact that the players can choose to stay at their current position or move to the next position.

A counterexample can be constructed as follows:

Input:

* n = 3, k = 2, P_B = 1, P_S = 2
* p = [2, 3, 1]
* a = [1, 2, 3]

In this case, the program will calculate the scores as follows:

* Bodya's score: 1 + 2 = 3 (stays at position 1)
* Sasha's score: 2 + 3 = 5 (moves to position 3)

However, the correct scores should be:

* Bodya's score: 1 + 2 = 3 (stays at position 1)
* Sasha's score: 2 + 1 = 3 (stays at position 2)

The program incorrectly calculates Sasha's score, leading to an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
