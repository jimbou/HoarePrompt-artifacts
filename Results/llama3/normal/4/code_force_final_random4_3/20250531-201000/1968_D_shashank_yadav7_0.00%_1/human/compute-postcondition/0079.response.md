Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than n+2, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `stdin` contains t-6 test cases, `b` is a positive integer equal to p[p[p[b] - 1] - 1] - 1, `s` is a positive integer equal to p[p[p[s] - 1] - 1] - 1, `p` is a list of n integers, `a` is a list of n positive integers, `sp` is a positive integer equal to a[s] + a[p[s] - 1] + a[p[p[s] - 1] - 1], `bp` is a positive integer equal to a[b] + a[p[b] - 1] + a[p[p[b] - 1] - 1], `bm` is a positive integer equal to max(0, a[p[p[b] - 1] - 1] * (k-2) + a[p[b] - 1] + a[b] * (k-1) + bp), `sm` is a positive integer equal to max(0, a[p[p[s] - 1] - 1] * (k-2) + a[p[s] - 1] + a[s] * (k-1) + sp). If k is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and k is decreased by 1.***
