The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is `n+1` and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than `n+1`. Also, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, so for the loop to execute again stdin contains `t-1-1` test cases.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `i` is `n+1`, stdin contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer equal to `p[b] - 1`, `s` is a positive integer equal to `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `sp` is a positive integer equal to `sp + a[s] * n`, `bp` is a positive integer equal to `bp + a[b] * n`, `bm` is a positive integer equal to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is a positive integer equal to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `k` is `-n+1` or not `-n+1`. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, 'Bodya' is printed. If `bm` is less than `sm`, 'Sasha' is printed. If `bm` is equal to `sm`, 'Draw' is printed.**
