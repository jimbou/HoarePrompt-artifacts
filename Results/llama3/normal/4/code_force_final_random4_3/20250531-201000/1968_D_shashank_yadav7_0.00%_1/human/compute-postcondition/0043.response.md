Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `b` is a positive integer equal to `p[b] - 1`, `s` is a positive integer equal to `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `sp` is a positive integer equal to `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is a positive integer equal to `a[b] + a[b]`, `bm` is a positive integer equal to `max(bm, a[b] * (k-1) + a[b])`, `sm` is a positive integer equal to `max(sm, a[s] * (k-1) + a[s])`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the updated values of `bm` and `sm`***
