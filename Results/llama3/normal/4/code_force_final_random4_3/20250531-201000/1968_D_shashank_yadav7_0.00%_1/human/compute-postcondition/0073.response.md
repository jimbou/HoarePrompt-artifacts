Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `n+2`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, stdin contains `t-6` test cases, `b` is a positive integer equal to `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is a positive integer equal to `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `sp` is a positive integer equal to `a[s] + a[p[s] - 1]`, `bp` is a positive integer equal to `a[b] + a[p[b] - 1]`, `bm` is a positive integer equal to `max(0, a[p[b] - 1] * (k-1) + a[b])`, `sm` is a positive integer equal to `max(0, a[p[s] - 1] * (k-1) + a[s])`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values and relationships. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement due to the `break` statement.
