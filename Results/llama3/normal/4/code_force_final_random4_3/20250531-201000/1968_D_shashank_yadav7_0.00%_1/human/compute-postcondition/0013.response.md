Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, i is 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is a positive integer greater than 1, b is a positive integer equal to p[p[b] - 1] - 1, s is a positive integer equal to p[p[s] - 1] - 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n positive integers, sp is a positive integer equal to sp + a[p[s] - 1] + a[s], bp is a positive integer equal to bp + a[p[b] - 1] + a[b], bm is a positive integer equal to bm + max(bm, a[p[b] - 1] * k + bp + a[b]), sm is a positive integer equal to sm + max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * k + sp + a[s]), k is -1 or not -1.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The values of `b` and `s` are updated based on the values of `p[b]` and `p[s]`, respectively. The values of `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` are updated based on the values of `a[s]`, `a[b]`, and `k`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
