Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than `n+2`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `b` is a positive integer equal to `p[b] - 1`, `s` is a positive integer equal to `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `sp` is a positive integer equal to `a[s]`, `bp` is a positive integer equal to `a[b]`, `bm` is a positive integer equal to `a[b] * 0`, `sm` is a positive integer equal to `a[s] * 0`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state of variables.***
