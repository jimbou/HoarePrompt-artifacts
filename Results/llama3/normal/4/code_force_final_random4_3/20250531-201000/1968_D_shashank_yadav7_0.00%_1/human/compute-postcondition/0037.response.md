Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer equal to 0, `b` is a positive integer equal to `p[b] - 2`, `s` is a positive integer equal to `p[s] - 2`, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `sp` is a positive integer equal to `a[s]`, `bp` is a positive integer equal to `a[b]`, `bm` is a positive integer equal to 0, `sm` is a positive integer equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t-4` test cases.
