Functionality: **This function determines the winner of a game between two players, 'Bodya' and 'Sasha', based on the maximum score they can achieve by traversing a permutation of integers and accumulating points. The function takes no explicit parameters but reads input from stdin, which contains the number of test cases, followed by the test cases themselves. Each test case consists of four integers (n, k, P_B, P_S) and two lists of n integers (p and a). The function calculates the maximum scores for both players and prints the winner ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') for each test case.**
