The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 2.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than n+1, i is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is a positive integer greater than 2, b is a positive integer equal to p[b] - 1, s is a positive integer equal to p[s] - 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n positive integers, sp is a positive integer equal to a[s] + a[s] + a[s], bp is a positive integer equal to a[b] + a[b] + a[b], bm is a positive integer equal to max(bm, a[b] * (k-1) + a[b] + a[b] * k + a[b] + a[b]), sm is a positive integer equal to max(sm, a[s] * (k-1) + a[s] + a[s] * k + a[s] + a[s])**
