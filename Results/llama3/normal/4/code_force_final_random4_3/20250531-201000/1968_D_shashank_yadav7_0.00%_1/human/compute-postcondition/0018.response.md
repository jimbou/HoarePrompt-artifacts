Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, i is 3, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is a positive integer greater than 3, b is a positive integer equal to p[p[b] - 1] - 1, s is a positive integer equal to p[p[s] - 1] - 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n positive integers, sp is a positive integer equal to sp + a[p[s] - 1] + a[s], bp is a positive integer equal to bp + a[p[b] - 1] + a[b], bm is a positive integer equal to bm + max(bm, a[p[b] - 1] * k + bp + a[b]), sm is a positive integer equal to sm + max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * k + sp + a[s]), k is -2 or not -2. If k is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp`. The first two lines update `b` and `s` to be one less than their previous values, which are `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1`, respectively. The next two lines increment `bm` and `sm` by the maximum of their current values and the products of `a[b] * k + bp` and `a[s] * k + sp`, respectively. The last two lines increment `sp` and `bp` by `a[s]` and `a[b]`, respectively. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `p`, `a`, and `k` remain unchanged.
