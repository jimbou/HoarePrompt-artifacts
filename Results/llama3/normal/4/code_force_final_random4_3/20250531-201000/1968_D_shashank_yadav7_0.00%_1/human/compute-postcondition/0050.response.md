Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than n+1, i is n, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is a positive integer, b is a positive integer equal to p[b] - 1, s is a positive integer equal to p[s] - 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n positive integers, sp is a positive integer equal to a[s] + a[s] + ... + a[s] (n times), bp is a positive integer equal to a[b] + a[b] + ... + a[b] (n times), bm is a positive integer equal to max(bm, a[b] * (k-1) + a[b] + a[b] * (k-2) + a[b] + ... + a[b] * 1 + a[b] + a[b]), sm is a positive integer equal to max(sm, a[s] * (k-1) + a[s] + a[s] * (k-2) + a[s] + ... + a[s] * 1 + a[s] + a[s]), k is 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the values of the variables have been updated accordingly. The loop counter `i` has reached `n`, and the values of `b` and `s` have been updated to point to the last elements of the lists `p` and `a` respectively. The values of `sp` and `bp` have been updated to be the sum of all elements in the lists `a` and `b` respectively. The values of `bm` and `sm` have been updated to be the maximum of their previous values and the sum of the products of the elements of `a` and `b` with the remaining number of iterations `k`. Finally, the value of `k` has been decreased to 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
