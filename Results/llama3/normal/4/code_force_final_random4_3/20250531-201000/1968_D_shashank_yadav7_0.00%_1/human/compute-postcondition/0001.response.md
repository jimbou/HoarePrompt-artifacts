To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and `i` in the loop head. Since `t` is a positive integer and `i` is the loop counter, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 to guarantee the loop executes at least once. Additionally, we need to set `i` to 0, which is the initial value of the loop counter.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains four integers n, k, P_B, P_S, followed by two lists of n integers p and a. n, k, P_B, P_S are positive integers, 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^9, 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n. p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n. a is a list of positive integers.**
