Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than n+1, i is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is a positive integer greater than 1, b is a positive integer equal to p[b] - 1, s is a positive integer equal to p[s] - 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n positive integers, sp is a positive integer equal to a[s] + a[s] + a[s], bp is a positive integer equal to a[b] + a[b] + a[b], bm is a positive integer equal to max(bm, a[b] * (k-1) + a[b] + a[b] * k + a[b] + a[b]), sm is a positive integer equal to max(sm, a[s] * (k-1) + a[s] + a[s] * k + a[s] + a[s]).**

In this final state, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The values of `b` and `s` are updated based on the values of `p[b]` and `p[s]`, respectively. The values of `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` are updated based on the previous values of `a[s]`, `a[b]`, `k`, and the updated values of `sp` and `bp`. The value of `stdin` remains unchanged as no input operations are performed.
