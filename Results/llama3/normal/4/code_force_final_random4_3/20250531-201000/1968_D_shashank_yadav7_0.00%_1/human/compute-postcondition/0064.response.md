Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than n+2, i is n+1, stdin contains t-6 test cases, n is a positive integer, b is a positive integer equal to p[b] - 1, s is a positive integer equal to p[s] - 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n positive integers, sp is a positive integer equal to a[s], bp is a positive integer equal to a[b], bm is a positive integer equal to a[b] * 0, sm is a positive integer equal to a[s] * 0, k is 0**

Explanation:

The code reads in four integers from stdin and assigns them to n, k, b, and s. It then reads in two lists of integers, p and a, each of length n. The values of b and s are decremented by 1. The variables sp, bp, bm, and sm are assigned values based on the values of a, b, and s. The value of k is not changed.

The initial state is updated as follows:

- t remains a positive integer greater than n+2.
- i remains n+1.
- stdin now contains t-6 test cases.
- n is updated to the value read from stdin.
- b and s are updated to the values read from stdin, decremented by 1.
- p and a are updated to the lists of integers read from stdin.
- sp, bp, bm, and sm are updated to the values calculated based on a, b, and s.
- k remains 0.

Note that the values of bm and sm are calculated as a[b] * k and a[s] * k, respectively, where k is 0. Therefore, bm and sm are both 0.
