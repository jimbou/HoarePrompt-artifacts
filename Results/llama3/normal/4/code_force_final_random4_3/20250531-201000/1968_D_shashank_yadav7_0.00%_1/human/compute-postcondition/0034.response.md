The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n+1`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 (the initial value of the range function) and `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **t is a positive integer greater than n+1, i is 0, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is a positive integer greater than 0, k is an integer, b is a positive integer equal to p[b] - 2, s is a positive integer equal to p[s] - 2, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n positive integers, sp is a positive integer equal to a[s], bp is a positive integer equal to a[b], bm is a positive integer equal to a[b] * k, sm is a positive integer equal to a[s] * k**
