The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `p` is a list of integers representing the count of each unique integer in `l`. If the maximum count of unique integers in `l` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k - 1` is printed. Otherwise, the number of integers in the list `l`, which is `n`, is printed.**
