The code prints the value of `k - 1`, where `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive). Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `k - 1`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `k - 1`.

Output: **k - 1 (where k is an integer between 2 and 100)**
