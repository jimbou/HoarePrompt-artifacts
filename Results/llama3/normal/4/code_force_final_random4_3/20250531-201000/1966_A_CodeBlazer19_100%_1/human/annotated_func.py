#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 500) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 100, 2 <= k <= 100). The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (1 <= c_i <= 100).
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
        
        if max(p) >= k:
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)
        
    #State: t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), i is t-1, stdin contains 0 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), l is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), p is a list of integers representing the count of each unique integer in l. If the maximum count of any integer in l is greater than or equal to k, then k - 1 is printed. Otherwise, the value of n is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the minimum number of elements required to make all elements in a list unique. For each test case, it reads two integers (n and k) and a list of n integers, counts the occurrences of each unique integer, and prints k-1 if the maximum count is greater than or equal to k, otherwise prints n.
