Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the minimum number of elements required to make all elements in a list unique. For each test case, it reads two integers (n and k) and a list of n integers, counts the occurrences of each unique integer, and prints k-1 if the maximum count is greater than or equal to k, otherwise prints n.**
