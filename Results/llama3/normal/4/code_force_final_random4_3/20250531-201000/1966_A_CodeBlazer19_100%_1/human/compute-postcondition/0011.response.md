Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), i is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), l is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), p is a list of integers representing the count of each unique integer in l.**

The code block reads two integers from stdin, assigning them to `n` and `k`, and then reads a list of `n` integers from stdin, assigning it to `l`. It then creates a list `p` containing the count of each unique integer in `l`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 2. The values of `n`, `k`, `l`, and `p` are updated based on the input values.
