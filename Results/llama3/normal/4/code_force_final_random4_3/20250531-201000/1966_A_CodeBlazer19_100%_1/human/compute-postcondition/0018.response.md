Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), i is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), l is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), p is a list of integers representing the count of each unique integer in l.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1 due to the execution of the code. The values of `n` and `k` have been updated to the input values. The list `l` now contains `n` integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and the list `p` contains the count of each unique integer in `l`.
