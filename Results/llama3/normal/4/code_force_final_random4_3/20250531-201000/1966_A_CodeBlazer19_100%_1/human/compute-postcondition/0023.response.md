Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), i is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), l is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), p is a list of integers representing the count of each unique integer in l. If the maximum count of any integer in l is greater than or equal to k, then k - 1 is printed. Otherwise, the value of n is printed.***
