To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), we can conclude that `t` is indeed at least 1.

However, to make the loop execute, we also need to adjust the state of `i`. Since the loop iterates over the range of `t`, we can set `i` to 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 0, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 100, 2 <= k <= 100). The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (1 <= c_i <= 100).**
