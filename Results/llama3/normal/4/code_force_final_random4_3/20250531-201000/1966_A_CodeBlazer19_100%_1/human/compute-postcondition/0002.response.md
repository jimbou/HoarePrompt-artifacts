Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), l is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), p is a list of integers representing the count of each unique integer in l**.

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains unchanged as it is not used or modified by the code. The stdin contains `t-1` test cases because one test case has been processed by the code.

The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the values read from the first line of the test case. The value of `l` is updated to the list of integers read from the second line of the test case. The value of `p` is a list of integers representing the count of each unique integer in `l`. The length of `p` is equal to the number of unique integers in `l`, and each element in `p` represents the count of the corresponding unique integer in `l`.
