The variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between 0 and 49 inclusive, So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 49 inclusive, `n` is an integer, `A` is a sorted list of 2t+2 integers, and the sum of every other element in the list `A` starting from the first element is being printed**
