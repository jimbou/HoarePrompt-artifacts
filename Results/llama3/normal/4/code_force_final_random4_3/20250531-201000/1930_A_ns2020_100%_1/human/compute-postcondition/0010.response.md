Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 48 inclusive, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `A` is a sorted list of 2t+2 integers, and the sum of every other element in the list `A` starting from the first element which is the sum of the elements at indices 0, 2, 4, 6, ..., 2t of the list `A` is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, so it is now between 0 and 48 inclusive. The values of `n` and `A` remain unchanged. The sum of every other element in the list `A` starting from the first element is still being printed, but the indices of the elements being summed have changed due to the decrement of `t`.
