Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the `2n` integers themselves.
3. It sorts the `2n` integers in ascending order using the `sort()` method.
4. It calculates the sum of every other integer starting from the first one using slicing (`A[::2]`) and prints the result.

The key insight here is that by sorting the integers, the program ensures that the smallest integer is always paired with the next smallest integer, which maximizes the sum of the minimum values. By summing every other integer starting from the first one, the program effectively calculates the maximum final score that can be achieved.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the strategy outlined in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
