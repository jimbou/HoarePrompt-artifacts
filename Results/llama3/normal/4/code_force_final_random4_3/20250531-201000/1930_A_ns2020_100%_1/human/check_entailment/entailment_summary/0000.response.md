Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the `2n` integers themselves.
3. It sorts the `2n` integers in ascending order using the `sort()` method.
4. It calculates the maximum final score by summing every other integer starting from the first one using slicing (`A[::2]`).
5. It prints the maximum final score for each test case.

The program's logic is correct because:

* Sorting the integers in ascending order ensures that the smallest integers are paired together, maximizing the sum of the minimum values.
* Summing every other integer starting from the first one effectively calculates the sum of the minimum values of each pair.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, reading multiple test cases, sorting the integers, and printing the maximum final score for each case.

Correctness: **True**
