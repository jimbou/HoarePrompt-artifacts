Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, n is an integer, A is a sorted list of 2t integers**.

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is one of the test cases. The list `A` is created by splitting the input line into 2t integers, which are then sorted in ascending order. The sorting operation does not change the number of elements in the list, so `A` still contains 2t integers.
