To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `t` since it's the only variable in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `t` is not equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 0 and 48 inclusive. To guarantee the loop can execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 48 inclusive, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `A` is a sorted list of 2t+2 integers**
