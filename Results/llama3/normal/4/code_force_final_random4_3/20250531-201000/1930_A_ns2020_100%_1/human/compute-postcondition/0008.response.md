The code prints the sum of every other element in the list A starting from the first element. Since A is a sorted list of 2t+2 integers and t is an integer between 1 and 49 inclusive, the list A will have between 4 and 100 elements. The sum will include the first element, the third element, the fifth element, and so on, until the second last element if the total number of elements is even, or the last element if the total number of elements is odd.
Output: **the sum of every other element in the list A starting from the first element (where A is a sorted list of 2t+2 integers and t is an integer between 1 and 49 inclusive)**
