Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the strategy to achieve the maximum final score. It first sorts the list of integers in ascending order. Then, it calculates the sum of every other integer starting from the first one (i.e., the smallest integers). This is because the optimal strategy is to always choose the smallest integer and pair it with the next smallest integer, effectively adding the smaller of the two to the score. By sorting the list and summing every other integer, the program correctly calculates the maximum final score that can be achieved.
