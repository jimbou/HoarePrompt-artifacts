The code prints the sum of every other element in the sorted list A, starting from the first element (index 0) and stepping by 2.
Since A is a sorted list of 2t+2 integers and t is an integer between 1 and 48 inclusive, the length of A is between 4 and 98 inclusive.
The sum of every other element in A will be the sum of the elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., 2t.
Output: **the sum of every other element in the sorted list A, starting from the first element (index 0) and stepping by 2**
