The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `A`. Since `A` was already a sorted list of 2t+2 integers, the third line does not change the value of `A`. The value of `t` is not affected by the code.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 48 inclusive, n is an integer equal to the input value, A is a sorted list of 2t+2 integers**
