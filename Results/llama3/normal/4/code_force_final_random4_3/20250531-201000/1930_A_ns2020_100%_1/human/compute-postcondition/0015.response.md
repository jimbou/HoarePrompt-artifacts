The value of `t` is decreased by 1, and the previous value of `t` was an integer between 1 and 48 inclusive. So the new value of `t` is an integer between 0 and 47 inclusive. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 47 inclusive, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `A` is a sorted list of 2t+2 integers, and the sum of every other element of the list A starting from the first element is being printed**
