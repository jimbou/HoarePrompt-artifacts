The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is not zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, which already ensures that `t` is not zero. Therefore, no adjustments are needed.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line, the line contains 2t integers a_1,a_2,â€¦,a_{2t}.**
