Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 49 inclusive, `n` is an integer, `A` is a sorted list of 2t+2 integers, and the sum of every other element in the list `A` starting from the first element is being printed**.

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, so it is now between 0 and 49 inclusive. The values of `n` and `A` remain unchanged, and the sum of every other element in the list `A` starting from the first element is still being printed.
