The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines, and the first line contains a single integer `n`, this integer `n` is assigned to `t`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Since stdin now contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line, the second line contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,…,a_{2n}. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line, the line contains 2t integers a_1,a_2,…,a_{2t}.
Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line, the line contains 2t integers a_1,a_2,…,a_{2t}.**
