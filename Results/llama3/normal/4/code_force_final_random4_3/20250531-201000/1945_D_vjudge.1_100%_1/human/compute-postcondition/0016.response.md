Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is `k-1`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are lists of positive integers of length `n`, `c` is a list of positive integers of length `n`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n+1` with all elements being 0 except `suff[i]` which is equal to `c[i] + suff[i + 1]`, `suff[i + 1]` is equal to `c[i + 1] + suff[i + 2]`, and so on, until `suff[n-1]` is equal to `c[n-1] + suff[n]`, and `suff[n]` is equal to `suff[n+1]`, and `ans` is either positive infinity or `a[0] + suff[1]` or `a[1] + suff[2]` or ... or `a[k-1] + suff[k]`.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `i` will be `k-1`, and the value of `ans` will be the minimum of its initial value (positive infinity) and the sums of `a[i]` and `suff[i+1]` for all `i` from 0 to `k-1`. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `suff`) remain unchanged.
