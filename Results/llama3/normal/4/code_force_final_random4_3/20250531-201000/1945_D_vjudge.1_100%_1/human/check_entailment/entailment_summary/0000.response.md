Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The program first calculates the suffix sum of the minimum values between the corresponding elements in lists a and b, starting from the end of the lists. Then, it iterates over the first k elements and calculates the minimum sum of a[i] + suff[i+1] for each i. The minimum sum is updated at each step, and the final minimum sum is printed as the result.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when k is equal to n, and when the minimum sum is not found (in which case it returns positive infinity).

Correctness: **True**
