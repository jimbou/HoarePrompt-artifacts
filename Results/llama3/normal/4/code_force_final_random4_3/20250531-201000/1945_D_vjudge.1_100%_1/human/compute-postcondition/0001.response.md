To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the integer `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Since `n` is a positive integer and 1 <= n <= 200,000, we can adjust the state of `n` to be at least 1. We also need to adjust the state of `i` to be `n - 1`, which is the initial value of the loop variable.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are lists of positive integers of length `n`, `c` is a list of positive integers of length `n`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n+1` with all elements being 0**
