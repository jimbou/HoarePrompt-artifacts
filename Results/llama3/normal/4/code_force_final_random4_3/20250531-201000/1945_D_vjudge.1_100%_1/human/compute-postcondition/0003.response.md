To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states accordingly.


The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):`. This means that `i` will decrease by 1 in each iteration.


At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be `n - 2`.


The state of `n` does not need to be adjusted because it is not changed by the loop.


The states of `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `suff` do not need to be adjusted because they are not changed by the loop.


State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are lists of positive integers of length `n`, `c` is a list of positive integers of length `n`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n+1` with all elements being 0 except `suff[i]` which is equal to `c[i] + suff[i + 1]`.**
