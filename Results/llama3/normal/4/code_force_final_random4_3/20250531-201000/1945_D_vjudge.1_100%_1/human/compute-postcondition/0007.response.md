Output State: **n is at least 1, i is -1, k is a positive integer, a and b are lists of positive integers of length n, c is a list of positive integers of length n, suff is a list of integers of length n+1 with all elements being 0 except suff[i] which is equal to c[i] + suff[i + 1], suff[i + 1] is equal to c[i + 1] + suff[i + 2], and so on, until suff[n-1] is equal to c[n-1] + suff[n], and suff[n] is equal to suff[n+1].**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `i` will be `-1`, and the `suff` list will have all elements being the cumulative sum of the `c` list in reverse order, starting from the last element of `c` and moving backwards to the first element. The other variables `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
