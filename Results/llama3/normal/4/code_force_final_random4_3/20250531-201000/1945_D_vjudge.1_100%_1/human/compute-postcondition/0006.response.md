Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 3`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are lists of positive integers of length `n`, `c` is a list of positive integers of length `n`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n+1` with all elements being 0 except `suff[i]` which is equal to `c[i] + suff[i + 1]`, `suff[i + 1]` is equal to `c[i + 1] + suff[i + 2]`, and `suff[i + 2]` is equal to `suff[i + 3]`.**

In this output state, the value of `suff[i]` has been updated to be equal to `c[i] + suff[i + 1]`, and the values of `suff[i + 1]` and `suff[i + 2]` remain the same as before. The other variables `n`, `i`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected by the code and retain their original values.
