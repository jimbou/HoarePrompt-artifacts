Output State: `n` is at least 1, `i` is `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are lists of positive integers of length `n`, `c` is a list of positive integers of length `n`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n+1` with all elements being 0 except `suff[i]` which is equal to `c[i] + suff[i + 1]`, `suff[i + 1]` is equal to `c[i + 1] + suff[i + 2]`, and so on, until `suff[n-1]` is equal to `c[n-1] + suff[n]`, and `suff[n]` is equal to `suff[n+1]`, and `ans` is either positive infinity or the minimum of `a[j] + suff[j + 1]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `k-1`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `i` is equal to `k`, and `ans` is either positive infinity or the minimum of the sums of `a[j]` and `suff[j + 1]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `k-1`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
