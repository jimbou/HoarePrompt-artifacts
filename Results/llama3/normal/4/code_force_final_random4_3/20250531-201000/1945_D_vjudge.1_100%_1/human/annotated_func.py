#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers, 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, a and b are lists of positive integers of length n, 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 and 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all i.
    c = [min(a[i], b[i]) for i in range(n)]
    suff = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]
        
    #State: n is at least 1, i is -1, k is a positive integer, a and b are lists of positive integers of length n, c is a list of positive integers of length n, suff is a list of integers of length n+1 with all elements being 0 except suff[i] which is equal to c[i] + suff[i + 1], suff[i + 1] is equal to c[i + 1] + suff[i + 2], and so on, until suff[n-1] is equal to c[n-1] + suff[n], and suff[n] is equal to suff[n+1].
    ans = float('inf')

        ans = min(ans, a[i] + suff[i + 1])
        
    #State: `n` is at least 1, `i` is `k-1`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are lists of positive integers of length `n`, `c` is a list of positive integers of length `n`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n+1` with all elements being 0 except `suff[i]` which is equal to `c[i] + suff[i + 1]`, `suff[i + 1]` is equal to `c[i + 1] + suff[i + 2]`, and so on, until `suff[n-1]` is equal to `c[n-1] + suff[n]`, and `suff[n]` is equal to `suff[n+1]`, and `ans` is either positive infinity or `a[0] + suff[1]` or `a[1] + suff[2]` or ... or `a[k-1] + suff[k]`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: the minimum sum of a[i] + suff[i+1] for i from 0 to k-1, or positive infinity if no such sum exists

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the minimum sum of a[i] + suff[i+1] for i from 0 to k-1, where suff[i+1] is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in lists a and b, starting from index i+1 to the end of the lists. If no such sum exists, it returns positive infinity. The function takes as input four parameters: two positive integers n and k, and two lists of positive integers a and b, each of length n.
