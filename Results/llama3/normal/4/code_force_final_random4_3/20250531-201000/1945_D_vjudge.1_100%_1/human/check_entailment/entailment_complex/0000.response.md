Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly initializes the `suff` array to store the suffix sums of the `c` array, which represents the minimum values between corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b`.

2. The program then iterates over the first `k` elements of the `a` array and calculates the minimum sum of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for each `i`. This is correct because `suff[i + 1]` represents the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b`, starting from index `i + 1` to the end of the lists.

3. The program correctly updates the `ans` variable to store the minimum sum found so far.

4. Finally, the program prints the minimum sum found, which is the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to not wait too long.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
