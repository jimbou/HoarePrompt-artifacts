Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `k` is a positive integer and at least 2, `a` and `b` are lists of positive integers of length `n`, `c` is a list of positive integers of length `n`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n+1` with all elements being 0 except `suff[i]` which is equal to `c[i] + suff[i + 1]`, `suff[i + 1]` is equal to `c[i + 1] + suff[i + 2]`, and so on, until `suff[n-1]` is equal to `c[n-1] + suff[n]`, and `suff[n]` is equal to `suff[n+1]`, and `ans` is either positive infinity or `a[0] + suff[1]` or `a[1] + suff[2]`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`, where `i` is 1. This means that `ans` is now either its previous value (positive infinity or `a[0] + suff[1]`) or `a[1] + suff[2]`, depending on which one is smaller. The values of the other variables remain the same.
