Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are lists of positive integers of length `n`, `c` is a list of positive integers of length `n`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n+1` with all elements being 0 except `suff[i]` which is equal to `c[i] + suff[i + 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `suff[i]` has been updated to be the sum of `c[i]` and `suff[i + 1]`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The list `suff` now has a non-zero value at index `i`, while all other elements remain 0.
