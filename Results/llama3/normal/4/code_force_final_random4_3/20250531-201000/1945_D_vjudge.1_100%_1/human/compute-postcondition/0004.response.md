Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are lists of positive integers of length `n`, `c` is a list of positive integers of length `n`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n+1` with all elements being 0 except `suff[i]` which is equal to `c[i] + suff[i + 1]`, and `suff[i + 1]` is equal to `suff[i + 2]`.**

In this output state, the value of `suff[i]` has been updated to be equal to `c[i] + suff[i + 1]`, which means it now includes the value of `c[i]` in its sum. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `suff` still has all elements being 0 except `suff[i]`, but now `suff[i + 1]` is also updated to be equal to `suff[i + 2]`, which is 0.
