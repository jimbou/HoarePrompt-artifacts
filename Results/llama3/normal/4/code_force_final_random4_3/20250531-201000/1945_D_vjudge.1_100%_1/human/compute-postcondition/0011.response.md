To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.


The loop head is `for i in range(k):`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `k` is a positive integer and at least 1.


For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `k` remains the same, but for the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than 1.


State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `k` is a positive integer and at least 2, `a` and `b` are lists of positive integers of length `n`, `c` is a list of positive integers of length `n`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n+1` with all elements being 0 except `suff[i]` which is equal to `c[i] + suff[i + 1]`, `suff[i + 1]` is equal to `c[i + 1] + suff[i + 2]`, and so on, until `suff[n-1]` is equal to `c[n-1] + suff[n]`, and `suff[n]` is equal to `suff[n+1]`, and `ans` is either positive infinity or `a[0] + suff[1]`.**
