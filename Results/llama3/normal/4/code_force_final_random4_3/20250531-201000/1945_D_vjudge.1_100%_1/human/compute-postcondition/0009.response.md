To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `k`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `i` is initialized to -1, we need to adjust its value to 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `k` is a positive integer and at least 1, `a` and `b` are lists of positive integers of length `n`, `c` is a list of positive integers of length `n`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n+1` with all elements being 0 except `suff[i]` which is equal to `c[i] + suff[i + 1]`, `suff[i + 1]` is equal to `c[i + 1] + suff[i + 2]`, and so on, until `suff[n-1]` is equal to `c[n-1] + suff[n]`, and `suff[n]` is equal to `suff[n+1]`, and `ans` is positive infinity**
