This function calculates and returns the minimum sum of a[i] + suff[i+1] for i from 0 to k-1, where suff[i+1] is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in lists a and b, starting from index i+1 to the end of the lists. If no such sum exists, it returns positive infinity. The function takes as input four parameters: two positive integers n and k, and two lists of positive integers a and b, each of length n.
