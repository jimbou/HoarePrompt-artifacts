The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is decreased by 1 so `i` is `n - 3` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 3.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 3`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are lists of positive integers of length `n`, `c` is a list of positive integers of length `n`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n+1` with all elements being 0 except `suff[i]` which is equal to `c[i] + suff[i + 1]`, and `suff[i + 1]` is equal to `suff[i + 2]`.**
