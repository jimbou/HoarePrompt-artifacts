Output State: **removals is at least 3, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, pos is a list containing three elements which are the sum of all elements in elements minus twice the sum of the last negatives elements in elements, the sum of all elements in elements minus twice the sum of the last negatives elements in elements, and the sum of all elements in elements minus twice the sum of the last negatives elements in elements minus twice the sum of the last two elements in elements, s is the sum of all elements in elements minus the last three elements, s2 is the sum of the last negatives-1 elements in elements, i is 3**

The code snippet modifies the values of `s` and `s2`. The first line subtracts the value of the element at index `-i` (which is the third last element) from `s`, effectively removing the last three elements from the sum. The second line subtracts the value of the same element from `s2`, reducing the sum of the last `negatives` elements by one. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, `pos`, and `i` remain unchanged.
