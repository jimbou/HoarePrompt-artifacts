The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `removals`. If `i` is less than `removals`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `removals` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `removals` must be at least 3.
State: **`removals` is at least 3, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, `pos` is a list containing three elements which are the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`, the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`, and the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last two elements in `elements`, `s` is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus the last two elements, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`, `i` is 3**
