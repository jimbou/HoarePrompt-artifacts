Output State: **`removals` is at least 3, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, `pos` is a list containing three elements which are the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`, the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`, and the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last two elements in `elements`, `s` is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus the last three elements, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`, `i` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `s2` has been updated to include the element at index `-(negatives + i)` in the `elements` list. Since `i` is 3, this means that `s2` now includes the element at index `-(negatives + 3)`, which is the fourth last element in the `elements` list. The other variables remain unchanged.
