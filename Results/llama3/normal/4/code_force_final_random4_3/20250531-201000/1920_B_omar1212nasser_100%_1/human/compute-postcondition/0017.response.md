Output State: **removals is 0, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, pos is a list containing removals + 1 elements which are the sum of all elements in elements minus twice the sum of the last negatives elements in elements, s is the sum of all elements in elements minus the last removals elements, s2 is the sum of the last negatives elements in elements.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the number of removals is 0, the number of negatives is still a non-negative integer, the list of elements is still sorted in ascending order, the list of positions has been updated to include the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last negatives elements for each iteration, the sum of all elements has been reduced by the last removals elements, and the sum of the last negatives elements remains the same.
