Output State: **removals is a non-negative integer, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, pos is a list containing one element which is the sum of all elements in elements minus twice the sum of the last negatives elements in elements, s is the sum of all elements in elements, s2 is the sum of the last negatives elements in elements.**

In this output state, the values of removals and negatives remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The list elements also remains unchanged as no elements are added or removed from it. The variable pos is initialized as an empty list and then appended with a single element which is the sum of all elements in elements minus twice the sum of the last negatives elements in elements. The variable s is assigned the sum of all elements in elements, and the variable s2 is assigned the sum of the last negatives elements in elements.
