Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: removals is a non-negative integer, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, pos is a list containing one element which is the sum of all elements in elements minus twice the sum of the last negatives elements in elements, s is the sum of all elements in elements, s2 is the sum of the last negatives elements in elements.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, removals + 1):
    s -= elements[-i]
    s2 -= elements[-i]
    if negatives + i <= len(elements):
        s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]
    pos.append(s - 2 * s2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, `pos` is a list containing two elements which are the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` and the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`, `s` is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus the last element, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`, `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `removals` is at least 2, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, `pos` is a list containing three elements which are the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`, the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`, and the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last two elements in `elements`, `s` is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus the last two elements, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`, `i` is 2. If `negatives` + `i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `removals` is at least 3, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, `pos` is a list containing four elements which are the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`, the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`, the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last two elements in `elements`, and the sum of all elements in `elements` minus the last three elements minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`, `s` is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus the last three elements, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`, `i` is 3. If `negatives` + `i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, no action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
