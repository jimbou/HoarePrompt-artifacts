Output State: **removals is at least 2, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, pos is a list containing two elements which are the sum of all elements in elements minus twice the sum of the last negatives elements in elements and the sum of all elements in elements minus twice the sum of the last negatives elements in elements, s is the sum of all elements in elements minus the last two elements, s2 is the sum of the last negatives-1 elements in elements, i is 2**

In this output state, the values of `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements` remain unchanged. The value of `pos` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `s` is updated to be the sum of all elements in `elements` minus the last two elements, and the value of `s2` is updated to be the sum of the last `negatives-1` elements in `elements`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2.
