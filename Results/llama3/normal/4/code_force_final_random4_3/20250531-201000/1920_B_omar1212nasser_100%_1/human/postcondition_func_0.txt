This function takes no parameters and returns no value. It reads a series of inputs from the user, including a number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the size of a list of integers, a value k, and a value x. It then reads a list of integers, sorts the list, and calls another function (func_2) with k, x, and the sorted list as arguments. The result of this function call is printed to the console. The function repeats this process for the specified number of test cases.
