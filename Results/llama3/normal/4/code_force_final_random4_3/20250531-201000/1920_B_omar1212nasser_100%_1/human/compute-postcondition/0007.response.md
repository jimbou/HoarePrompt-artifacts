To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `removals`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `removals + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `removals` is at least 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `removals` remains the same, but since `i` is now 2, `removals` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`removals` is at least 2, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, `pos` is a list containing two elements which are the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` and the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`, `s` is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus the last element, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`, `i` is 2**
