Postcondition: ***removals is at least 2, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, pos is a list containing two elements which are the sum of all elements in elements minus twice the sum of the last negatives elements in elements and the sum of all elements in elements minus twice the sum of the last negatives elements in elements, s is the sum of all elements in elements minus the last two elements, s2 is the sum of the last negatives elements in elements, i is 2. If negatives + i is less than or equal to the length of elements, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
