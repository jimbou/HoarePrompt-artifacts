Postcondition: ***`removals` is at least 3, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, `pos` is a list containing three elements which are the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`, the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`, and the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last two elements in `elements`, `s` is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus the last three elements, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`, `i` is 3. If `negatives` + `i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
