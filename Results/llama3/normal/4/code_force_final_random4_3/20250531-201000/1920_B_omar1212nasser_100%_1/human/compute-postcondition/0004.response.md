Output State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, `pos` is a list containing one element which is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`, `s` is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus the last element, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`, `i` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `s2` has been updated to include the element at index `-(negatives + i)` in the `elements` list. This means that `s2` now includes one more element from the end of the `elements` list, in addition to the `negatives-1` elements it already included. The other variables remain unchanged.
