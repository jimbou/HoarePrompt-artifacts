Output State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, `pos` is a list containing two elements which are the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` and the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`, `s` is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus the last element, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`, `i` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `pos` has been updated to include a new element which is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`. The other variables remain unchanged.
