This function reads a number of test cases from standard input, then for each test case, it reads the size of a square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell. It prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to meet the diagonal requirement. If the minimum number of diagonals is 1, it prints 1. If the minimum number of diagonals is less than or equal to twice the grid size, it prints the ceiling of half the minimum number of diagonals. Otherwise, it prints half the minimum number of diagonals plus 1.
