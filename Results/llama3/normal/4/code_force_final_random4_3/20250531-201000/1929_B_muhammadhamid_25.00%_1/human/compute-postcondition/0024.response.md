Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains at least one line of input. If `k` is equal to 1, the number 1 is printed and the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped, moving on to the next iteration. Otherwise, if `k` is less than or equal to twice `n`, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is printed. If `k` is greater than twice `n`, the value of `k // 2 + 1` is printed.***
