To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there is input to read from `stdin`. Since the first line of input contains the number of test cases `t`, we can adjust the state to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`stdin` contains at least one line of input, the first line contains a single integer `t` that is at least 1**
