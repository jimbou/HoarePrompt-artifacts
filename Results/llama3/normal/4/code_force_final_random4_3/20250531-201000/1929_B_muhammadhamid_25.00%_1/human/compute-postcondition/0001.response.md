Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, stdin contains at least one line of input**.

In this output state, `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the first two integers from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin contains at least one line of input, but the first line has been consumed by the `input()` function, so it now contains at least one line of input minus one.
