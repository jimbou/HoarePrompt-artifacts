The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `input()`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `input()`. If `input()` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `input()` is at least 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `input()` must be at least 2.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains at least two lines of input.**
