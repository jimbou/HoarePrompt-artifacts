Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) — the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2) — the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if k == 1:
        print(1)
        continue
    if k <= 2 * n:
        print(math.ceil(k / 2))
    else:
        print(k // 2 + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains at least one line of input. If `k` is 1, the number 1 is printed and the rest of the code inside the current loop is skipped, moving to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program continues with the rest of the code. If `k` is less than or equal to twice the value of `n`, the ceiling of half of `k` is printed. If `k` is larger than twice the value of `n`, the value of `k // 2 + 1` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains at least one line of input. If `k` is equal to 1, the number 1 is printed and the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped, moving on to the next iteration. Otherwise, if `k` is less than or equal to twice `n`, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is printed. If `k` is greater than twice `n`, the value of `k // 2 + 1` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` and `k` are integers assigned from the first line of stdin, stdin contains at least one line of input. If `k` is less than or equal to twice `n`, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is printed. Otherwise, if `k` is equal to 1, the number 1 is printed and the loop proceeds to the next iteration, otherwise the integer division of `k` by 2 plus 1 is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
