Output State: **The loop has executed for the number of times specified by the integer t in the first line of stdin. For each iteration, if k is 1, the number 1 is printed and the rest of the code inside the current loop is skipped, moving to the next iteration. Otherwise, if k is less than or equal to twice the value of n, the ceiling of half of k is printed. If k is larger than twice the value of n, the value of k // 2 + 1 is printed.**

This output state means that the loop has completed all its iterations as specified by the input t. For each iteration, the appropriate value was printed based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The loop has now terminated, and the program has moved on to the next part of the code.
