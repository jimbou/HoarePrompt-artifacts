Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, stdin contains at least one line of input. If `k` is 1, the number 1 is printed and the rest of the code inside the current loop is skipped, moving to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program continues with the rest of the code. `k` is larger than 2 times `n`.***
