Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in a square grid of size n x n, such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

The program first reads the number of test cases t, and then for each test case, it reads the values of n and k. If k is 1, it prints 1, as only one cell needs to be colored to satisfy the condition.

If k is greater than 1, the program checks if k is less than or equal to 2n. If it is, the program prints the ceiling of k/2, which is the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to satisfy the condition.

If k is greater than 2n, the program prints k//2 + 1, which is the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to satisfy the condition.

The program's logic is correct, as it covers all possible cases and prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to satisfy the condition.

Correctness: **True**
