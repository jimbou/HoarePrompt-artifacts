Output: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, stdin contains at least one line of input. If `k` is 1, the number 1 is printed and the rest of the code inside the current loop is skipped, moving to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program continues with the rest of the code. The current value of `k` is less than or equal to twice the value of `n`, and the ceiling of half of `k` is printed**
