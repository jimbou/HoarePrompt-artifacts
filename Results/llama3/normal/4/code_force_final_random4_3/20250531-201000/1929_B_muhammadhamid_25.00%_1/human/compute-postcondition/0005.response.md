Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is 1, stdin contains at least one line of input, and the number 1 is being printed, and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains at least one line of input. The number 1 is still being printed. However, the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration.
