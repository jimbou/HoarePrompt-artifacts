Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains at least one line of input. If `k` is 1, the number 1 is printed and the rest of the code inside the current loop is skipped, moving to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program continues with the rest of the code. If `k` is less than or equal to twice the value of `n`, the ceiling of half of `k` is printed. If `k` is larger than twice the value of `n`, the value of `k // 2 + 1` is printed.***
