The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from stdin, splits it into two parts, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively.

Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains at least two lines of input, the first line is read and split into two parts. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integers read from the input.

The output state is: `n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains at least one line of input.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains at least one line of input.**
