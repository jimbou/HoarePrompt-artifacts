Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains at least one line of input, and the number 1 is being printed, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration.**

In natural language, this means that the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, the input in stdin is still present, and the number 1 is still being printed. However, the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration, effectively skipping any remaining code in the current iteration.
