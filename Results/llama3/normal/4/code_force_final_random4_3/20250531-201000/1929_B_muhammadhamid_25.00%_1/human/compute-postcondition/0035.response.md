Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers assigned from the first line of stdin, stdin contains at least one line of input. If `k` is less than or equal to twice `n`, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is printed. Otherwise, if `k` is equal to 1, the number 1 is printed and the loop proceeds to the next iteration, otherwise the integer division of `k` by 2 plus 1 is printed.***
