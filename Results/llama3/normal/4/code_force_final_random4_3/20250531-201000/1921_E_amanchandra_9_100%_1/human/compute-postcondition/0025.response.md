Output: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, r is the minimum value between w and d + x, w is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, c is an integer, d is an integer, _ is 1, x is the absolute difference between a and c divided by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, and this is printed: 'Draw' if the absolute difference between l and b is less than or equal to x + 1 and the absolute difference between r and b is less than or equal to x + 1, otherwise 'Alice'**
