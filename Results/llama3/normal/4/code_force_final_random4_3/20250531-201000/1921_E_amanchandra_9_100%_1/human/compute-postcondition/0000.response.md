Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b such that 1 <= x_a, x_b <= h <= 10^6 and 1 <= y_a, y_b <= w <= 10^9.**

In this output state, the variable `t` is assigned the value of the first test case from the input, which is a positive integer. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one test case, since one test case has been read and assigned to `t`. The rest of the test cases remain in the stdin, each containing six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b with the given constraints.
