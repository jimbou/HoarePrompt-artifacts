Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing six integers representing the dimensions of a rectangle and the positions of two points, Alice and Bob. It then determines the winner of a game based on the relative positions of Alice and Bob, printing 'Draw' if the game is a draw, 'Alice' if Alice wins, or 'Bob' if Bob wins. The function processes all test cases and prints the results for each case.**
