stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains six integers: h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b. h and w are positive integers representing the dimensions of the board. x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b are positive integers representing the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips on the board. It is guaranteed that either x_a != x_b or y_a != y_b.
