Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when Alice's chip is in the last row (x_a = h) or Bob's chip is in the first row (x_b = 1). In these cases, the game should end in a draw, but the program does not check for these conditions.

For example, if the input is "4 4 4 1 1 1", the program will output "Alice" instead of "Draw", because Alice's chip is in the last row and cannot move.

To fix this, the program should add additional checks for these conditions and output "Draw" when either Alice's chip is in the last row or Bob's chip is in the first row.
