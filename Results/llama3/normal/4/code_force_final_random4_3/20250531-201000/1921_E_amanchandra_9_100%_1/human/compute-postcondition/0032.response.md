The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers assigned from the input, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**
