The code snippet consists of two lines that assign new values to the variables `l` and `r`. The first line assigns the maximum value between 1 and `b - x` to `l`. Since `b` and `x` are integers, the value of `l` will be an integer. The second line assigns the minimum value between `w` and `b + x` to `r`. Since `w`, `b`, and `x` are integers, the value of `r` will be an integer.

The values of `t`, `_`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not affected by the code snippet. The value of `x` is still a non-negative integer. The absolute difference between `a` and `c` is still even. Stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.

Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, r is an integer, w is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, c is an integer, d is an integer, _ is 0, x is a non-negative integer, l is an integer, a is less than or equal to c, the absolute difference between a and c is even, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**
