Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the game logic and determines the winner based on the relative positions of Alice and Bob.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  If Alice's row (`a`) is greater than Bob's row (`c`), the game is a draw because Alice cannot move down to Bob's position.
2.  If the absolute difference between Alice's and Bob's rows (`abs(a - c)`) is even, the program calculates the range of columns (`l` and `r`) that Bob can reach in `x` moves. If Bob's column (`d`) is within this range, Bob wins; otherwise, the game is a draw.
3.  If the absolute difference between Alice's and Bob's rows (`abs(a - c)`) is odd, the program calculates the range of columns (`l` and `r`) that Alice can reach in `x` moves. If Alice's column (`b`) is within this range, Alice wins; otherwise, the game is a draw.

The program correctly handles all possible scenarios and prints the winner or a draw accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
