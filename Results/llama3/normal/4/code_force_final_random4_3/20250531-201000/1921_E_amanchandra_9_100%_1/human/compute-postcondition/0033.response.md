The code accepts a space-separated list of integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. The values of the other variables are not affected. Since stdin is now one test case less, we will include it in the output state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**
