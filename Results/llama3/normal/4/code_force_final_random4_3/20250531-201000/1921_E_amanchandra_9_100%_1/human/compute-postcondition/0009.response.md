Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, r is an integer equal to the minimum of w and d + x, w is an integer, a is an integer less than or equal to c, b is an integer, c is an integer, d is an integer, _ is 0, x is a non-negative integer, l is an integer equal to the maximum of 1 and d - x, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line assigns the maximum value between 1 and `d - x` to `l`. Since `d` and `x` are integers, and `x` is non-negative, the value of `l` will be an integer. The second line assigns the minimum value between `w` and `d + x` to `r`. Since `w`, `d`, and `x` are integers, and `x` is non-negative, the value of `r` will be an integer. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `_`, and `x` remain unchanged. The value of `d` is used in both lines but is not modified. The state of stdin remains the same as it is not affected by the code.
