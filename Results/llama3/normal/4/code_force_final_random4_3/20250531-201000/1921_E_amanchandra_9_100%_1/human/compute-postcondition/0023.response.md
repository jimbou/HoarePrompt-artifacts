Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, r is the minimum value between w and d + x, w is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, c is an integer, d is an integer, _ is 1, x is the absolute difference between a and c divided by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**

The code snippet consists of two lines that modify the values of `l` and `r`. The first line assigns the maximum value between 1 and `d - x` to `l`. Since `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, `d - x` is an integer. The maximum value between 1 and `d - x` is also an integer, so `l` becomes an integer. The second line assigns the minimum value between `w` and `d + x` to `r`. Since `w` is an integer and `d + x` is an integer, the minimum value between them is also an integer, so `r` becomes an integer.

The values of `t`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `_`, and `x` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code snippet. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, as no input operations are performed.
