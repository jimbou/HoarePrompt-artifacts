The code prints either 'Draw' or 'Alice' based on the conditions `abs(l - b) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - b) <= x + 1`. 

The value of `l` is the maximum of 1 and `d - x`, where `d` is an integer and `x` is a non-negative integer. The value of `r` is the minimum of `w` and `d + x`, where `w` is an integer. The value of `b` is an integer.

If both conditions are true, it prints 'Alice'. Otherwise, it prints 'Draw'.

Output: **'Alice' if both conditions are true, otherwise 'Draw'**
