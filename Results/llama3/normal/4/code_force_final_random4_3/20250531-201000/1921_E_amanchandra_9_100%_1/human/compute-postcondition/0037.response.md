Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, r is the minimum value between w and d + x, w is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, c is an integer, d is an integer, _ is 2, x is a non-negative integer less than or equal to the absolute difference between a and c, l is the maximum value between 1 and d - x, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

The code snippet consists of two lines that assign values to the variables `l` and `r`. The first line assigns the maximum value between 1 and `d - x` to `l`. Since `d` is an integer and `x` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to the absolute difference between `a` and `c`, the value of `l` will be at least 1 and at most `d`. The second line assigns the minimum value between `w` and `d + x` to `r`. Since `w` is an integer and `d + x` is an integer, the value of `r` will be the smaller of the two values. The values of `t`, `_`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The value of `x` also remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The state of stdin remains the same, as no input operations are performed.
