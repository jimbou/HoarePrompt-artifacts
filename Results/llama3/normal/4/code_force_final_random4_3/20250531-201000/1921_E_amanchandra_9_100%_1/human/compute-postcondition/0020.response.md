Based on the initial state, the code snippet, and the task, I will determine what will be printed when the statement executes.

The initial state describes the state of the program before the code is executed. It states that `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers assigned from the input, `_` is 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.

The code snippet is a simple print statement that prints the string 'Draw'.

Now, let's analyze the print statement. The print statement does not use any variables or objects that are defined in the initial state. It simply prints a fixed string 'Draw'.

Therefore, based on the precondition and the code snippet, the output will be the string 'Draw'.


Output: **Draw**
