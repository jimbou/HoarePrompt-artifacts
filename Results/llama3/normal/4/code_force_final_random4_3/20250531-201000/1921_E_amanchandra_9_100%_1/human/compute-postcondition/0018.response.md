The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 and `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**
