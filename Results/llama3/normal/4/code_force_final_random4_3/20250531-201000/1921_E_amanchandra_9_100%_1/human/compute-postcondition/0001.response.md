The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. So for the loop to be executed  `t` must be greater than 0 and `_` is 0.
State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `_` is 0**
