The code prints either 'Draw' or 'Alice' based on the conditions `abs(l - b) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - b) <= x + 1`. 

The value of `l` is the maximum value between 1 and `d - x`, and the value of `r` is the minimum value between `w` and `d + x`. 

The value of `x` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to the absolute difference between `a` and `c`. 

The value of `b` is an integer.

The output depends on the values of `l`, `r`, `x`, and `b`. If both conditions are met, it prints 'Alice', otherwise it prints 'Draw'.

Output: **'Alice' if both conditions are met, otherwise 'Draw'**
