Output: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, r is the minimum value between w and d + x, w is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, c is an integer, d is an integer, _ is 2, x is a non-negative integer less than or equal to the absolute difference between a and c, l is the maximum value between 1 and d - x, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, and either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed based on the conditions abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1**
