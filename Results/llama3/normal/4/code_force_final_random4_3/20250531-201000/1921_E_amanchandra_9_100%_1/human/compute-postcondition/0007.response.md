Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers, `_` is 0, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is less than or equal to `c`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `x` is calculated as the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, which results in a non-negative integer. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the condition `a` is less than or equal to `c` is still valid. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by two.
