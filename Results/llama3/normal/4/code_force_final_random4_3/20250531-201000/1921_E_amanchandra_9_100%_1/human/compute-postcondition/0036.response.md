Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers, `_` is 2, `x` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to the absolute difference between `a` and `c`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `x` is calculated as the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, which results in a non-negative integer. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.
