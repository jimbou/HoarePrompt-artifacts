The code prints either 'Draw' or 'Bob' based on the conditions `abs(l - d) <= x` and `abs(r - d) <= x`. 

Here, `l` is the maximum value between 1 and `b - x`, `r` is the minimum value between `w` and `b + x`, `x` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to the absolute difference between `a` and `c`, and `d` is an integer.

If both conditions are met, it prints 'Draw'. Otherwise, it prints 'Bob'.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `w`, and `x` are not provided, we can't determine the exact output. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either 'Draw' or 'Bob' depending on the conditions.

Output: **'Draw' if both conditions are met, 'Bob' otherwise**
