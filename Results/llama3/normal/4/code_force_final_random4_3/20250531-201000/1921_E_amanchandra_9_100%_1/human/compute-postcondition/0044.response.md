Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If `a` > `c`, then 'Draw' is printed. If `a` <= `c`, then `x` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to the absolute difference between `a` and `c`. If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd, then `r` is the minimum value between `w` and `d + x`, `l` is the maximum value between 1 and `d - x`, and either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed based on the conditions `abs(l - b) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - b) <= x + 1`. If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even, then `r` is the minimum value between `w` and `b + x`, `l` is the maximum value between 1 and `b - x`, and either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether `abs(l - d) <= x` and `abs(r - d) <= x`.***
