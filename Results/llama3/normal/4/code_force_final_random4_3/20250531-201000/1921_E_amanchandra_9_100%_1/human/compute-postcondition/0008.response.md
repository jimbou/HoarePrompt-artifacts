Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers, `_` is 0, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is less than or equal to `c`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. The current value of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd***
