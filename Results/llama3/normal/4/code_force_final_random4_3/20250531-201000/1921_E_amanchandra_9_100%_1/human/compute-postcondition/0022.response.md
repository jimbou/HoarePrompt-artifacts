Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers assigned from the input, `_` is 1, `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `x` is calculated as the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, using the `abs` function to ensure the result is always non-negative. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.
