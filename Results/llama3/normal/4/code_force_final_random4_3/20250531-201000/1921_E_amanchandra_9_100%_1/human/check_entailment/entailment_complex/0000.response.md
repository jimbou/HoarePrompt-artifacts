Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the relative positions of Alice and Bob.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first checks if Alice's initial position is above Bob's initial position (i.e., `a > c`). If this is the case, the game is a draw, and the program prints "Draw".

2. If Alice's initial position is not above Bob's, the program calculates the number of moves `x` that Alice needs to make to reach Bob's row. If the difference in rows is odd, Alice will make an odd number of moves, and if the difference is even, Alice will make an even number of moves.

3. If Alice makes an odd number of moves, the program calculates the range of columns that Bob can move to in the same number of moves. If Bob's column is within this range, Alice wins, and the program prints "Alice". Otherwise, the game is a draw, and the program prints "Draw".

4. If Alice makes an even number of moves, the program calculates the range of columns that Bob can move to in the same number of moves. If Bob's column is within this range, Bob wins, and the program prints "Bob". Otherwise, the game is a draw, and the program prints "Draw".

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct outcome for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
