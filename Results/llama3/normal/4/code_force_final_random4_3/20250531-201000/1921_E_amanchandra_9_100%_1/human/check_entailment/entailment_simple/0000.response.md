Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines the outcome of the game based on the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.

The program first checks if Alice's chip is above Bob's chip. If it is, the game is a draw because Alice cannot move her chip to a position that would allow her to win.

If Alice's chip is not above Bob's chip, the program calculates the number of moves Alice needs to make to reach Bob's row. If the number of moves is odd, Alice can potentially win by moving her chip to a position that would allow her to capture Bob's chip. The program checks if Bob's chip is within the range of Alice's potential moves and prints "Alice" if it is, and "Draw" otherwise.

If the number of moves is even, Bob can potentially win by moving his chip to a position that would allow him to capture Alice's chip. The program checks if Alice's chip is within the range of Bob's potential moves and prints "Bob" if it is, and "Draw" otherwise.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct outcome of the game.

Correctness: **True**
