Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers assigned from the input, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are updated to the integers read from the input, which is a space-separated list of integers. The value of `t` remains a positive integer greater than 1, and the value of `_` remains 1. The stdin now contains one less test case than before, since one test case has been read and processed.
