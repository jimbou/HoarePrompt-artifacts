Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b such that 1 <= x_a, x_b <= h <= 10^6 and 1 <= y_a, y_b <= w <= 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    r, w, a, b, c, d = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if a > c:
        print('Draw')
    else:
        x = abs(a - c) // 2
        if abs(a - c) % 2:
            l = max(1, d - x)
            r = min(w, d + x)
            print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <=
                x + 1])
        else:
            l = max(1, b - x)
            r = min(w, b + x)
            print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. If `a` is greater than `c`, 'Draw' is printed. If `a` is less than or equal to `c`, then if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd, `r` is equal to the minimum of `w` and `d + x`, `l` is equal to the maximum of 1 and `d - x`, and either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between `l` and `b` is less than or equal to `x + 1` and the absolute difference between `r` and `b` is less than or equal to `x + 1`. If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even, then either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between `l` and `d` is less than or equal to `x` and the absolute difference between `r` and `d` is less than or equal to `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers assigned from the input, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. If `a` > `c`, 'Draw' is printed. Otherwise, `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2. If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd, `r` is the minimum value between `w` and `d` + `x`. Either 'Draw' is printed if the absolute difference between `l` and `b` is less than or equal to `x` + 1 and the absolute difference between `r` and `b` is less than or equal to `x` + 1, otherwise 'Alice' is printed. If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even, `r` is the minimum of `w` and `b` + `x`, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `b` - `x`, and either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between `l` and `d` is less than or equal to `x` and the absolute difference between `r` and `d` is less than or equal to `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If `a` > `c`, then 'Draw' is printed. If `a` <= `c`, then `x` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to the absolute difference between `a` and `c`. If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd, then `r` is the minimum value between `w` and `d + x`, `l` is the maximum value between 1 and `d - x`, and either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed based on the conditions `abs(l - b) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - b) <= x + 1`. If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even, then `r` is the minimum value between `w` and `b + x`, `l` is the maximum value between 1 and `b - x`, and either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether `abs(l - d) <= x` and `abs(r - d) <= x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
