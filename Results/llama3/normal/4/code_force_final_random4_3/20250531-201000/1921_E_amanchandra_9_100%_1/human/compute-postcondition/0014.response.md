The code prints either 'Draw' or 'Bob' based on the conditions `abs(l - d) <= x` and `abs(r - d) <= x`. 

Since `abs(l - d) <= x` and `abs(r - d) <= x` are conditions, we can't determine their exact boolean values without knowing the values of `l`, `d`, `x`, and `r`. However, we can describe the output based on these conditions.

If both conditions are true, the code prints 'Draw'. If either or both conditions are false, the code prints 'Bob'.

Output: **'Draw' if both abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x are true, otherwise 'Bob'**
