Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. If `a` is greater than `c`, 'Draw' is printed. If `a` is less than or equal to `c`, then if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd, `r` is equal to the minimum of `w` and `d + x`, `l` is equal to the maximum of 1 and `d - x`, and either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between `l` and `b` is less than or equal to `x + 1` and the absolute difference between `r` and `b` is less than or equal to `x + 1`. If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even, then either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between `l` and `d` is less than or equal to `x` and the absolute difference between `r` and `d` is less than or equal to `x`.***
