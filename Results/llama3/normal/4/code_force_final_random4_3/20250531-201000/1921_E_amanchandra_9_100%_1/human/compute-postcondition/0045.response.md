Output State: **`t` is 0, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers, `_` is `t`, stdin contains no test cases.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the loop counter `_` has reached the value of `t`, which is now 0. The variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` still hold integer values, but their specific values are no longer relevant as the loop has finished executing. The input stream `stdin` is now empty, as all test cases have been processed.
