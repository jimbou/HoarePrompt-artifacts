Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is an empty set, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 0, `j` is `m`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, stdin contains 0 test cases, `r` is `m`, `old` is `a[m - m]` which is `a[0]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `old` is assigned the first element of the list `a`, which is `a[0]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
