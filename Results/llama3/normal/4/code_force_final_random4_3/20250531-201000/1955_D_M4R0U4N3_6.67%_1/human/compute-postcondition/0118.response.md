To determine what will be printed when the `print(ans)` statement is executed, we need to understand the conditions that define the value of `ans`.

Given the initial state, `ans` is defined based on the number of elements in the `done` set and its relation to the integer `k`. There are two possible scenarios:

1. **If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`**, then `ans` is set to `n - m + 1`.
2. **Otherwise (if the number of elements in `done` is less than `k`)**, `ans` is set to `n - m`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the elements in `done` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either `n - m + 1` or `n - m`, depending on the condition met.

Therefore, the output will be one of these two expressions, where `n` and `m` are the values of the integers `n` and `m` as defined in the initial state.

Output: **n - m + 1 (if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k) or n - m (otherwise)**
