Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer that is less than n, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers, done is an empty set of integers, extra is an empty set of integers, _ is 1, j is n, ans is the number of elements in done if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is the number of elements in done, stdin is empty, r is n
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    if a[j] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[j])
        done.add(a[j])
    else:
        extra.add(a[j])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is at least 1 and less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 1, `j` is 0, `ans` is the number of elements in `done` if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is the number of elements in `done`, `stdin` is empty, `r` is `n`. If the element at index `j` of `a` is in `todo`, then `todo` has one less element than before, `done` has one more element than before, and `extra` is empty. Otherwise, `todo` remains unchanged, `done` is empty, and `extra` contains the element at index `j` of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 1, `j` is 1, `ans` is the number of elements in `done` if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is the number of elements in `done`, `stdin` is empty, `r` is `n`. If the element at index `j` of `a` is in `todo`, then `todo` has one less element than before, `done` has one more element than before, and `extra` is empty. Otherwise, `todo` remains unchanged, `done` is empty, and `extra` contains the element at index `j` of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 1, `j` is 2, `ans` is the number of elements in `done` if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is the number of elements in `done`, `stdin` is empty, `r` is `n`. If the integer at index 2 of list `a` is in `todo`, then `todo` has one less element and `done` has one more element. Otherwise, `extra` includes the integer at index 2 of list `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
