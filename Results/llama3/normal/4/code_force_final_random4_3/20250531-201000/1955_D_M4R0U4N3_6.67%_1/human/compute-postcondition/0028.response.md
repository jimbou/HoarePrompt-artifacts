Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer that is less than n, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers that contains a[0] if a[0] is not in done and a[0] is not in extra, otherwise todo is an empty set, done is a set of integers that contains all elements it had before except a[0] if a[0] is in done and a[0] is in extra, otherwise done remains unchanged, extra is a set of integers that does not contain a[0], _ is 0, j is m, ans is 1 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is 0, stdin contains 0 test cases, r is m, and old is in todo if old is not in done and old is not in extra. The current value of a[r] is not in todo and is in done.**

In this final state, the value of `a[r]` has been removed from the set `todo` and added to the set `done`. The value of `r` remains unchanged as `m`. All other variables retain their original values and properties as specified in the initial state.
