The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `j` is 2, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains 0 test cases. If `a[1]` is in `todo`, then `todo` has one element removed and `done` has one element added. Otherwise, `a[1]` is added to `extra`.**
