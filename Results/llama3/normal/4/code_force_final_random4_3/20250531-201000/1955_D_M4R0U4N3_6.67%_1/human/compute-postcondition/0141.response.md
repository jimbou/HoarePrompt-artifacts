Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers that does not contain `old` which is `a[0]`, `_` is 2, `j` is `m`, `r` is `m`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `old` is `a[0]`.**

In this output state, the value of `extra` has been updated to exclude `old` which is `a[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
