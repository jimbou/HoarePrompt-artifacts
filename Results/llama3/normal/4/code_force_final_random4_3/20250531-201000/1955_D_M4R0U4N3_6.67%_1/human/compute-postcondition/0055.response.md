Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, if `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` has `a[r]` removed and `done` has `a[r]` added. Otherwise, `extra` has `a[r]` added. `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 0, `j` is `m+2`, `r` is `m+2`, `ans` is 4 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 3. stdin contains 0 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is now 4, otherwise it is 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
