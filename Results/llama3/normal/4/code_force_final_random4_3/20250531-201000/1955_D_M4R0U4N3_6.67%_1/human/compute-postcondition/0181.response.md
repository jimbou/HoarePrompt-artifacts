Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, m, k) and two lists of integers (a and b). It then processes the lists to determine the number of elements in the first list (a) that are present in the second list (b) within a sliding window of size m. The function prints the count of such elements for each test case.**
