Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is an empty set, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 0, `j` is `m`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, stdin contains 0 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    old = a[r - m]
    if old in extra:
        extra.remove(old)
    elif old in done:
        done.remove(old)
        todo.add(old)
    if a[r] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[r])
        done.add(a[r])
    else:
        extra.add(a[r])
    if len(done) >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers that contains `a[0]` if `a[0]` is not in `done` and `a[0]` is not in `extra`, otherwise `todo` is an empty set, `done` is a set of integers that contains all elements it had before except `a[0]` if `a[0]` is in `done` and `a[0]` is in `extra`, otherwise `done` remains unchanged, `extra` is a set of integers that contains `a[r]` if `a[r]` is not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` does not contain `a[r]`, `_` is 0, `j` is `m`, `ans` is 2 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 1, stdin contains 0 test cases, `r` is `m`, and `old` is in `todo` if `old` is not in `done` and `old` is not in `extra`. Additionally, if `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `a[r]` is not in `todo` and is in `done`, otherwise `a[r]` is not in `todo` and is in `extra`. The current value of `done` has a length of at least `k` if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `done` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 0, `j` is `m+1`, `ans` is 3 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 2, stdin contains 0 test cases, `r` is `m+1`, `old` is `a[r - m]`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` contains all elements it had before except `a[r]`, `done` contains all elements it had before plus `a[r]`, and `extra` contains `a[r]` if `a[r]` is not in `todo`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `todo` contains `a[0]` if `a[0]` is not in `done` and `a[0]` is not in `extra`, otherwise `todo` is an empty set, `done` contains all elements it had before except `a[0]` if `a[0]` is in `done` and `a[0]` is in `extra`, otherwise `done` remains unchanged, and `extra` contains `a[r]` and `a[r]` is not in `todo`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer, m is an integer that is less than n, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, if a[r] is in todo, then todo has a[r] removed and done has a[r] added. Otherwise, extra has a[r] added. extra is a set of integers, _ is 0, j is m+2, r is m+2. If the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, then ans is 4. Otherwise, ans is 3. stdin contains 0 test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
