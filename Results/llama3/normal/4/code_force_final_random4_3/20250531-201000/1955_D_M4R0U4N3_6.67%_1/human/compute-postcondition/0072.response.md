To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(m):`. This means that the only variable that can be adjusted is `j`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1, and `m` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 1, `j` is 2, `ans` is the number of elements in `done` if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is the number of elements in `done`, `stdin` is empty, `r` is `n`.**
