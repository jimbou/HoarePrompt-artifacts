Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that is at least 2, `m` is an integer that is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `j` is 1, `r` is `n`, `_` is 2, `stdin` is empty. If the first element of `a` is in `todo`, then `todo` has one less element and `done` contains the value of the first element of `a`. Otherwise, `todo` remains unchanged and `extra` contains the first element of `a` which is not in `todo` or `done`.***
