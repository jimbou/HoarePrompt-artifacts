Output State: **n is an integer that is at least 2, m is an integer that is at least 1 and less than n, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers with one less element, done is a set containing the value of a[j], extra is an empty set, _ is 2, j is 0, r is n, stdin is empty.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line removes the value of `a[j]` from the set `todo`, reducing the number of elements in `todo` by one. The second line adds the value of `a[j]` to the set `done`, making `done` a set containing the value of `a[j]`. No other variables are affected by the code.
