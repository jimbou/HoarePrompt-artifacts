Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers that contains the element at index `j` of `a`, `_` is 1, `j` is 1, `ans` is the number of elements in `done` if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is the number of elements in `done`, `stdin` is empty, `r` is `n`.**

In this output state, the element at index `j` of `a` has been added to the set `extra`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `ans` is still dependent on the number of elements in `done`, which has not changed in this code snippet.
