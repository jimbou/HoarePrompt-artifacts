According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `m` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer that is at least 2, `m` is an integer that is at least 3, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `j` is 2, `r` is `n`, `_` is 2, `stdin` is empty. If the first element of `a` is in `todo`, then `todo` has one less element and `done` contains the value of the first element of `a`. Otherwise, `todo` remains unchanged and `extra` contains the first element of `a` which is not in `todo` or `done`.**
