Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 2, `j` is `m`, `r` is `m`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0. If the first element of `a` is in `extra`, then `extra` does not contain the first element of `a`. Otherwise, if the first element of `a` is in `done`, then `todo` includes the first element of `a`. Otherwise, `todo`, `done`, and `extra` do not include the first element of `a`. The current value of `r` is `m` and the element at index `r` in `a` is in `todo`.***
