Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers, done is an empty set, extra is an empty set, _ is 0, stdin contains 0 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    if a[j] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[j])
        done.add(a[j])
    else:
        extra.add(a[j])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains 0 test cases, `j` is 0. If `a[j]` is in `todo`, then `todo` has one less element and `done` contains the current value of `a[j]`. Otherwise, `todo` remains unchanged, `done` is empty, and `extra` contains the element at index `j` of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `j` is 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains 0 test cases. If `a[1]` is in `todo`, then `todo` has one element removed and `done` has one element added. Otherwise, `a[1]` is added to `extra`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `j` is 2, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains 0 test cases. If `a[2]` is in `todo`, then `todo` has one element removed, `done` has one element added which is `a[2]`, and `a` is a list of integers with `a[2]` removed. Otherwise, `a[2]` is added to `extra` and `a` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
