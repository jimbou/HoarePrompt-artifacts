The only variables in the loop head are variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the value returned by int(input()), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, int(input()) is 0. For the loop to execute again, int(input()) must be greater than 0.
State: **n is an integer, m is an integer that is less than n, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers, done is a set of integers, extra is a set of integers, _ is 1, j is n, ans is the number of elements in done if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is the number of elements in done, stdin contains 1 test case, r is n**
