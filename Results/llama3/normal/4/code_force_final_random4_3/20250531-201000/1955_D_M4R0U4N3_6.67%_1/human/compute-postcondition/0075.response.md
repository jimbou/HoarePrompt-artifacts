Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 1, `j` is 2, `ans` is the number of elements in `done` if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is the number of elements in `done`, `stdin` is empty, `r` is `n`. If the integer at index 2 of list `a` is in `todo`, then `todo` has one less element and `done` has one more element. Otherwise, `extra` includes the integer at index 2 of list `a`.***
