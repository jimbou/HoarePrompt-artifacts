Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 1, `j` is 1, `ans` is the number of elements in `done` if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is the number of elements in `done`, `stdin` is empty, `r` is `n`. If the element at index `j` of `a` is in `todo`, then `todo` has one less element than before, `done` has one more element than before, and `extra` is empty. Otherwise, `todo` remains unchanged, `done` is empty, and `extra` contains the element at index `j` of `a`.**
