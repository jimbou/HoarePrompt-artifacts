Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers that contains `a[m+2]`, `_` is 0, `j` is `m+2`, `r` is `m+2`, `ans` is 3 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 2. stdin contains 0 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `extra` has been updated to include `a[m+2]`, which is equivalent to `a[r]` since `r` is equal to `m+2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is still dependent on the number of elements in `done` being greater than or equal to `k`.
