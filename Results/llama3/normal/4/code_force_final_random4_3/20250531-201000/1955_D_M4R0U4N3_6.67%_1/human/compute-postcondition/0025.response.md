Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers that contains `old` (which is `a[0]`) if `old` is not in `done`, otherwise `todo` is an empty set, `done` is a set of integers that contains all elements it had before except `old` if `old` is in `done`, otherwise `done` remains unchanged, `extra` is a set of integers that does not contain `old`, `_` is 0, `j` is `m`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, stdin contains 0 test cases, `r` is `m`, and `old` is in `todo` if `old` is not in `done`.***
