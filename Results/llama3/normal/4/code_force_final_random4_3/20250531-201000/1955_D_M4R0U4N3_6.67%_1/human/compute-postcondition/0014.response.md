Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `j` is 2, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains 0 test cases, `extra` has one element added which is `a[2]`. If `a[1]` is in `todo`, then `todo` has one element removed and `done` has one element added. Otherwise, `a[1]` is added to `extra`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `j`, and `_` remain unchanged. The `stdin` still contains 0 test cases. The `extra` set has been updated by adding the element at index 2 of the list `a`. The conditions related to `todo` and `done` are still valid, but now `extra` has an additional element which is `a[2]`.
