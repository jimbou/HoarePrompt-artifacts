Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that is at least 2, `m` is an integer that is at least 3, `k` is an integer, `j` is 2, `r` is `n`, `_` is 2, and `stdin` is empty. If the third element of `a` is in `todo`, then `a` has the third element removed, `todo` has one less element (the one that was at index 2 in `a`), and `done` contains the value that was at index 2 in `a`, and `extra` is unchanged. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged, `todo` remains unchanged, `done` remains unchanged, and `extra` contains the third element of `a` which is not in `todo` or `done`.***
