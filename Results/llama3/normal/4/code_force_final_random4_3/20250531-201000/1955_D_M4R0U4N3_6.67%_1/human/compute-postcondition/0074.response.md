Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers that includes the integer at index 2 of list `a`, `_` is 1, `j` is 2, `ans` is the number of elements in `done` if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is the number of elements in `done`, `stdin` is empty, `r` is `n`.**

In this output state, the only change is that the set `extra` now includes the integer at index 2 of list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
