Output State: **n is an integer, m is greater than 1, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers with one element removed, done is a set of integers with one element added, extra is a set of integers, _ is 0, stdin contains 0 test cases, j is 1**

The code removes an element from the `todo` set and adds it to the `done` set. The element removed from `todo` and added to `done` is the integer at index `j` in the list `a`. Since `j` is 1, the element removed and added is the second element of the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
