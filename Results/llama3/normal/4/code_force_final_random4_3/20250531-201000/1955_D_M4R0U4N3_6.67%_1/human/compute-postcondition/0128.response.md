The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `m` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer that is at least 2, `m` is an integer that is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 2, `j` is 1, `r` is `n`, `stdin` is empty. If the first element of `a` is in `todo`, then `todo` has one less element and `done` contains the value of the first element of `a`. Otherwise, `todo` remains unchanged and `extra` contains the first element of `a` which is not in `todo` or `done`.**
