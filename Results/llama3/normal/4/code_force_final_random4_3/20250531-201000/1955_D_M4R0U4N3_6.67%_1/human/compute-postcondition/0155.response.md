The only variable in the loop head is variable `r`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `r`, `m` and `n`. If `r` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is `m`, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `n` is an integer. For the loop to execute again `r` must be increased by 1 so `r` is `m + 1` and for the loop to execute again `m` must be less than `n` so `m` is an integer that is less than `n` and `n` is an integer.
State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 2, `j` is `m`, `r` is `m + 1`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0. If the first element of `a` is in `extra`, then `extra` does not contain the first element of `a`. Otherwise, if the first element of `a` is in `done`, then `todo` includes the first element of `a`. Otherwise, `todo`, `done`, and `extra` do not include the first element of `a`. If the element at index `r` of `a` is in `todo`, then `todo` does not include the element at index `r` of `a` and `done` includes the element at index `r` of `a`. Otherwise, `extra` includes the element at index `r` of `a`.**
