Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer that is less than n, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers that does not include the element at index r of a, done is a set of integers that includes the element at index r of a, extra is a set of integers, _ is 2, j is m, r is m + 1. If the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, then ans is 2. Otherwise, ans is 1 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is 0.**

The code removes the element at index `r` of `a` from `todo` and adds it to `done`. This means that `todo` no longer includes the element at index `r` of `a`, and `done` now includes it. The other variables remain unchanged.
