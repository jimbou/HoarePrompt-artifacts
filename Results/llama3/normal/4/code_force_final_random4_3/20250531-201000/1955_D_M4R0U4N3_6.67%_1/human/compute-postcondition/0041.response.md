Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer that is less than n, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers that contains all elements it had before except a[r], done is a set of integers that contains all elements it had before plus a[r], extra is a set of integers that contains a[r] if a[r] is not in todo, otherwise extra does not contain a[r], _ is 0, j is m+1, ans is 2 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is 1, stdin contains 0 test cases, r is m+1, old is a[r - m], and old is in todo if old is not in done and old is not in extra. If old is in extra, then extra does not contain old. If old is in done, then done does not contain old and todo contains old.**

The code removes a[r] from the set todo and adds it to the set done. This means that todo will no longer contain a[r], and done will now contain a[r]. The value of extra is not directly affected by the code, but its value depends on whether a[r] is in todo or not. If a[r] is not in todo, then extra will contain a[r]. If a[r] is in todo, then extra will not contain a[r]. The values of n, m, k, a, _, j, ans, and stdin are not affected by the code. The value of old is not directly affected by the code, but its value depends on the value of r and m. The value of r is m+1, so old is a[r - m] = a[m+1 - m] = a[1]. The value of old is in todo if old is not in done and old is not in extra. If old is in extra, then extra does not contain old. If old is in done, then done does not contain old and todo contains old.
