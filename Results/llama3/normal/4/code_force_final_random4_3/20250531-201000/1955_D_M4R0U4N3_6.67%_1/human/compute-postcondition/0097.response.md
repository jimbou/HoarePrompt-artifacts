Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers that does not contain `a[0]`, `_` is 1, `j` is `m`, `r` is `m+1`, `old` is `a[0]`, `stdin` is empty. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 0. If `a[0]` is in `done`, `todo` contains `a[0]` and `done` does not contain `a[0]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `todo`, `done`, `_`, `j`, `r`, `old`, `stdin` and `ans` remains the same as the initial state. The only change is that `a[0]` is removed from the set `extra`. If `a[0]` was in `done`, it is now also in `todo` and removed from `done`.
