Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers, done is an empty set, extra is an empty set, _ is 0, stdin contains 0 test cases.**

The first line reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`, respectively. The second line reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `a`. The third line reads a set of integers from stdin and assigns it to `todo`. The fourth and fifth lines initialize `done` and `extra` as empty sets. The variable `_` remains unchanged with a value of 0. After executing the code, stdin is empty, containing no test cases.
