Output State: **n is an integer, m is greater than 2, k is an integer, a is a list of integers with a[1] removed, j is 2, _ is 0, stdin contains 0 test cases, todo has one element removed, done has one element added which is a[1].**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `j`, and `_` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The list `a` has its element at index 1 removed, as indicated by `a[j]` being removed. The `todo` list has one element removed, which is `a[1]`, and the `done` list has one element added, which is also `a[1]`. The state of `stdin` remains the same, containing 0 test cases.
