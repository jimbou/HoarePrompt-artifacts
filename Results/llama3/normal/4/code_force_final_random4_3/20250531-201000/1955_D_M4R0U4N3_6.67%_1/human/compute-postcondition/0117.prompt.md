Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 1, `j` is `m`, `r` is `n`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `stdin` is empty.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    old = a[r - m]
    if old in extra:
        extra.remove(old)
    elif old in done:
        done.remove(old)
        todo.add(old)
    if a[r] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[r])
        done.add(a[r])
    else:
        extra.add(a[r])
    if len(done) >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 1, `j` is `m`, `r` is `m`, `stdin` is empty. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 0. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` does not contain `a[r]` and `done` contains `a[r]`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `extra` contains `a[r]`. If `a[0]` is in `extra`, then `a[0]` is not in `extra` after the execution. If `a[0]` is not in `extra`, then if `a[0]` is in `done`, `todo` contains `a[0]` and `done` does not contain `a[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 1, `j` is `m`, `r` is `m+1`, `old` is `a[0]`, `stdin` is empty. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 1. If `a[0]` is in `done`, `todo` contains `a[0]` and `done` does not contain `a[0]`. If `a[0]` is in `extra`, then `a[0]` is not in `extra`. If `a[0]` is not in `extra`, then if `a[0]` is in `done`, `todo` contains `a[0]` and `done` does not contain `a[0]`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` does not contain `a[r]` and `done` contains `a[r]`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `extra` contains `a[r]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 1, `j` is `m`, `r` is `m+2`, `old` is `a[r - m]`, and stdin is empty. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 4. Otherwise, `ans` is 2. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` does not contain `a[r]` and `done` contains `a[r]`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `extra` contains `a[r]`. If `a[r - m]` is in `done`, `todo` contains `a[r - m]` and `done` does not contain `a[r - m]`. If `a[r - m]` is not in `extra`, then if `a[r - m]` is in `done`, `todo` contains `a[r - m]` and `done` does not contain `a[r - m]`. If `old` is in `done`, then `old` is not in `done`, `old` is in `todo`, and `extra` does not contain `old`. If `old` is not in `done`, then `old` is in `done`, `todo` does not contain `old`, and `extra` contains `old`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
