Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 0, `j` is `m+2`, `ans` is 3 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 2, stdin contains 0 test cases, `r` is `m+2`, `old` is `a[m+2 - m]` which is `a[2]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`, `_`, `j`, `ans`, and `r` remain unchanged. The value of `old` is updated to be the third element of the list `a`, which is `a[2]`.
