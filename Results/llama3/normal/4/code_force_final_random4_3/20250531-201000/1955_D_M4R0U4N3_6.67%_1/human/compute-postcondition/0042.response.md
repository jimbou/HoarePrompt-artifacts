Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers that contains `a[0]` if `a[0]` is not in `done` and `a[0]` is not in `extra`, otherwise `todo` is an empty set, `done` is a set of integers that contains all elements it had before except `a[0]` if `a[0]` is in `done` and `a[0]` is in `extra`, otherwise `done` remains unchanged, `extra` is a set of integers that contains `a[r]` and `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `_` is 0, `j` is `m+1`, `ans` is 2 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 1, stdin contains 0 test cases, `r` is `m+1`, `old` is `a[r - m]`, and `old` is in `todo` if `old` is not in `done` and `old` is not in `extra`. If `old` is in `extra`, then `extra` does not contain `old`. If `old` is in `done`, then `done` does not contain `old` and `todo` contains `old`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `extra` now contains `a[r]` and `a[r]` is not in `todo`. The other variables remain unchanged.
