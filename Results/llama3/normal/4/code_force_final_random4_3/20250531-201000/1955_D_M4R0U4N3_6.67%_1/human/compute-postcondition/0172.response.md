Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer that is less than n, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers that does not include the element at index r of a, done is a set of integers that includes the element at index r of a, extra is a set of integers, _ is 2, j is m, r is m + 2, n is greater than m + 2. If the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, then ans is 3. Otherwise, ans is 2 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k - 1, otherwise ans is 1.**

The code modifies the sets todo and done by removing the element at index r of a from todo and adding it to done. This change affects the conditions that determine the value of ans. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.
