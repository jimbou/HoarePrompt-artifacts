Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer that is less than n, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, if a[r] is in todo, then todo has a[r] removed and done has a[r] added. Otherwise, extra has a[r] added. extra is a set of integers, _ is 0, j is m+2, r is m+2, ans is 3 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is 2. stdin contains 0 test cases.***
