Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is an empty set, `extra` contains the element at index `j` of `a`, `j` is 0, and the element at index `j` of `a` is not in `todo`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains 0 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `todo`, `done`, `j`, `_`, and `stdin` remains the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the element at index `j` of `a` is added to the set `extra`.
