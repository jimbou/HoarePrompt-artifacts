Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the sliding window approach to solve the problem. The program maintains three sets: `todo`, `done`, and `extra`. The `todo` set contains the elements of array `b` that have not been matched yet, the `done` set contains the elements of array `b` that have been matched, and the `extra` set contains the elements of array `a` that are not in array `b`.

The program first initializes the `todo`, `done`, and `extra` sets based on the first `m` elements of array `a`. Then, it iterates over the rest of array `a`, updating the `todo`, `done`, and `extra` sets accordingly. If the number of elements in the `done` set is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the `ans` variable.

Finally, the program prints the `ans` variable, which represents the number of good subsegments of array `a`.

Correctness: **True**
