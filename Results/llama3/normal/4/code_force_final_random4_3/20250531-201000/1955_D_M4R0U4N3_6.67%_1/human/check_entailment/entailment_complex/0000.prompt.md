Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Note

In the first example, all subsegments are good.

In the second example, good subsegments start at positions 1 , 2 , and 3 .

In the third example, good subsegments start at positions 1 and 2 .

# Annotated Program:
from collections import defaultdict, Counter

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, m, and k, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, and a list of m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m. 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5. 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^6.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        todo = set(map(int, input().split()))
        
        done = set()
        
        extra = set()
        
        for j in range(m):
            if a[j] in todo:
                todo.remove(a[j])
                done.add(a[j])
            else:
                extra.add(a[j])
        
        ans = 1 if len(done) >= k else 0
        
        for r in range(m, n):
            old = a[r - m]
            if old in extra:
                extra.remove(old)
            elif old in done:
                done.remove(old)
                todo.add(old)
            if a[r] in todo:
                todo.remove(a[r])
                done.add(a[r])
            else:
                extra.add(a[r])
            if len(done) >= k:
                ans += 1
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: n is an integer, m is an integer that is less than n, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers, done is a set of integers, extra is a set of integers, _ is the number of test cases, j is m, r is n, ans is the number of elements in done that are greater than or equal to k, stdin is empty. If the element at index r - m of a is in extra, then extra does not include the element at index r - m of a. Otherwise, if the element at index r - m of a is in done, then todo includes the element at index r - m of a and done does not include the element at index r - m of a. Otherwise, todo does not include the element at index r - m of a and done includes the element at index r - m of a. The element at index r of a is either in done or extra, and the number of elements in done that are greater than or equal to k is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, m, k) and two lists of integers (a and b). It then processes the lists to determine the number of elements in the first list (a) that are present in the second list (b) within a sliding window of size m. The function prints the count of such elements for each test case.
