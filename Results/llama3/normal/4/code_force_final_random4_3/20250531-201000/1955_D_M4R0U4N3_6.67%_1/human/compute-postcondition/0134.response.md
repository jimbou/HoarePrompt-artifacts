Output State: **`n` is an integer that is at least 2, `m` is an integer that is at least 3, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `j` is 2, `r` is `n`, `_` is 2, `todo` is unchanged, `done` is unchanged, `extra` contains the third element of `a` which is not in `todo` or `done`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `j`, `r`, and `_` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `extra` is updated to include the third element of `a`, which is not in `todo` or `done`. The values of `todo` and `done` are unchanged.
