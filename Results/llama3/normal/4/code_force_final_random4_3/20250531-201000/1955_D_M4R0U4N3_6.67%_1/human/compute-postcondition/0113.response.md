Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers that contains `a[r]`, `_` is 1, `j` is `m`, `r` is `m+2`, `old` is `a[r - m]`, `stdin` is empty. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 1. If `a[r - m]` is in `done`, `todo` contains `a[r - m]` and `done` does not contain `a[r - m]`. If `a[r - m]` is not in `extra`, then if `a[r - m]` is in `done`, `todo` contains `a[r - m]` and `done` does not contain `a[r - m]`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` does not contain `a[r]` and `done` contains `a[r]`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `extra` contains `a[r]`. If `a[r - m]` is in `extra`, then `a[r - m]` is not in `extra`. If `a[r - m]` is not in `extra`, then if `a[r - m]` is in `done`, `todo` contains `a[r - m]` and `done` does not contain `a[r - m]`. If `old` is in `done`, then `old` is not in `done`, `old` is in `todo`, and `extra` does not contain `old`. If `old` is not in `done`, then `old` is in `done`, `todo` does not contain `old`, and `extra` contains `old`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The code adds the element at index `r` of list `a` to the set `extra`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.
