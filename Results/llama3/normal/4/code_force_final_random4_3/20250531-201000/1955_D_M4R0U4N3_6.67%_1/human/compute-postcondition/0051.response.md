Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 0, `j` is `m+2`, `r` is `m+2`. If `a[2]` is in `extra`, then `a[2]` is removed from `extra`. If `a[2]` is in `done`, then `a[2]` is added to `todo` and removed from `done`. `ans` is 3 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 2. stdin contains 0 test cases.**
