Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer that is less than n, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers that contains a[r - m], done is a set of integers that does not contain a[r - m], extra is a set of integers that does not contain a[r - m], _ is 1, j is m, r is m+2, old is not in done, old is in todo.**

The code removes `old` from `done` and adds it to `todo`. Since `old` is `a[r - m]`, this means that `a[r - m]` is no longer in `done` but is now in `todo`. The value of `old` is not changed, it is still `a[r - m]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
