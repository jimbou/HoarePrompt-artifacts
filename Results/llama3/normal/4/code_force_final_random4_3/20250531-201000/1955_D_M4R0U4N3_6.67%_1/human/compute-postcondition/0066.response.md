Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is at least 1 and less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is an empty set of integers, `extra` is a set containing the element at index `j` of `a`, `_` is 1, `j` is 0, `ans` is the number of elements in `done` if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is the number of elements in `done`, `stdin` is empty, `r` is `n`. The element at index `j` of `a` is not in `todo`.**

In this output state, the only change is that the `extra` set now contains the element at index `j` of `a`, which was not in `todo` initially. All other variables remain unchanged.
