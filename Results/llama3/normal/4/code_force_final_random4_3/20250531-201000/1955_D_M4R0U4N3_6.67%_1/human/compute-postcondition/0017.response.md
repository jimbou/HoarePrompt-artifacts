The code assigns a value to the variable `ans` based on the size of the set `done`. If the size of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is assigned the value 1; otherwise, it is assigned the value 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is an empty set, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 0, `j` is `m`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, stdin contains 0 test cases.**
