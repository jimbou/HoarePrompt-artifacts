Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers that does not include the element at index `r - m` of `a`, `_` is 2, `j` is `m`, `r` is `m + 1`, `old` is not in `extra`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0. If the first element of `a` is in `extra`, then `extra` does not contain the first element of `a`. Otherwise, if the first element of `a` is in `done`, then `todo` includes the first element of `a`. Otherwise, `todo`, `done`, and `extra` do not include the first element of `a`. If the element at index `r` of `a` is in `todo`, then `todo` does not include the element at index `r` of `a` and `done` includes the element at index `r` of `a`. Otherwise, `extra` includes the element at index `r` of `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `extra` has been updated to not include the element at index `r - m` of `a`, which is stored in the variable `old`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the first element of `a` and the element at index `r` of `a` are still valid, and the value of `ans` is still determined by the number of elements in `done` compared to `k`.
