Output State: **`n` is an integer that is at least 2, `m` is an integer that is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` contains the first element of `a` which is not in `todo` or `done`, `_` is 2, `j` is 1, `r` is `n`, `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values except for `extra`, which now contains the first element of list `a` that is not present in either `todo` or `done`.
