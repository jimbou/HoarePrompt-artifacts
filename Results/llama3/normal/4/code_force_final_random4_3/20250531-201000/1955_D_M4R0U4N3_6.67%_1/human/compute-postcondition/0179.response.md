The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the number of elements in `done` that are greater than or equal to `k`.
Output: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 2, `j` is `m`, `r` is `n`, `ans` is the number of elements in `done` that are greater than or equal to `k`. If the element at index `r - m` of `a` is in `extra`, then `extra` does not include the element at index `r - m` of `a`. Otherwise, if the element at index `r - m` of `a` is in `done`, then `todo` includes the element at index `r - m` of `a` and `done` does not include the element at index `r - m` of `a`. Otherwise, `todo` does not include the element at index `r - m` of `a` and `done` includes the element at index `r - m` of `a`. The element at index `r` of `a` is either in `done` or `extra`, and the number of elements in `done` that are greater than or equal to `k` is printed**
