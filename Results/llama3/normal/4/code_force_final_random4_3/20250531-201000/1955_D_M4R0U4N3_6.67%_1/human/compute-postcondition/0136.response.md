Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 2, `j` is `m`, `r` is `n`, `stdin` is empty. For each element in `a`, if the element is in `todo`, then `todo` has one less element and `done` contains the value of the element. Otherwise, `todo` remains unchanged and `extra` contains the element which is not in `todo` or `done`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the following characteristics:

*   The values of `n`, `k`, and `_` remain unchanged.
*   The value of `m` is the same as the initial value of `j`.
*   The value of `r` is the same as the initial value of `n`.
*   The value of `stdin` remains empty.
*   The list `a` remains unchanged.
*   The set `todo` will have all elements from `a` removed if they were present in `todo`.
*   The set `done` will contain all elements from `a` that were present in `todo`.
*   The set `extra` will contain all elements from `a` that were not present in `todo` or `done`.
