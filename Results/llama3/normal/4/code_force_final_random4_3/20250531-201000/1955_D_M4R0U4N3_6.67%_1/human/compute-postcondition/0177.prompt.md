Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 2, `j` is `m`, `r` is `n`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `stdin` is empty.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    old = a[r - m]
    if old in extra:
        extra.remove(old)
    elif old in done:
        done.remove(old)
        todo.add(old)
    if a[r] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[r])
        done.add(a[r])
    else:
        extra.add(a[r])
    if len(done) >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 2, `j` is `m`, `r` is `m`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0. If the first element of `a` is in `extra`, then `extra` does not contain the first element of `a`. Otherwise, if the first element of `a` is in `done`, then `todo` includes the first element of `a`. Otherwise, `todo`, `done`, and `extra` do not include the first element of `a`. If the element at index `r` of `a` is in `todo`, then `todo` does not include the element at index `r` of `a` and `done` includes the element at index `r` of `a`. Otherwise, `extra` includes the element at index `r` of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 2, `j` is `m`, `r` is `m + 1`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 2 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, otherwise `ans` is 1. If the first element of `a` is in `extra`, then `extra` does not contain the first element of `a`. Otherwise, if the first element of `a` is in `done`, then `todo` includes the first element of `a`. Otherwise, `todo`, `done`, and `extra` do not include the first element of `a`. If the element at index `r` of `a` is in `todo`, then `todo` does not include the element at index `r` of `a` and `done` includes the element at index `r` of `a`. Otherwise, `extra` includes the element at index `r` of `a`. If the element at index `r - m` of `a` is in `extra`, then `extra` does not include the element at index `r - m` of `a`. Otherwise, if the element at index `r - m` of `a` is in `done`, then `todo` includes the element at index `r - m` of `a` and `done` does not include the element at index `r - m` of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 2, `j` is `m`, `r` is `m + 2`, `n` is greater than `m + 2`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 4. Otherwise, `ans` is 3 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, otherwise `ans` is 2. If the first element of `a` is in `extra`, then `extra` does not contain the first element of `a`. Otherwise, if the first element of `a` is in `done`, then `todo` includes the first element of `a`. Otherwise, `todo`, `done`, and `extra` do not include the first element of `a`. If the element at index `r` of `a` is in `todo`, then `todo` does not include the element at index `r` of `a` and `done` includes the element at index `r` of `a`. Otherwise, `extra` includes the element at index `r` of `a`. If the element at index `r - m` of `a` is in `extra`, then `extra` does not include the element at index `r - m` of `a`. Otherwise, if the element at index `r - m` of `a` is in `done`, then `todo` includes the element at index `r - m` of `a` and `done` does not include the element at index `r - m` of `a`. Otherwise, `todo` does not include the element at index `r - m` of `a` and `done` includes the element at index `r - m` of `a`. The element at index `r` of `a` is either in `done` or `extra`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
