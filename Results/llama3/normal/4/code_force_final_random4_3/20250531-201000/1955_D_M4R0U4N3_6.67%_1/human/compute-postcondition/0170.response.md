Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 2, `j` is `m`, `r` is `m + 2`, `n` is greater than `m + 2`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 2 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, otherwise `ans` is 1. If the first element of `a` is in `extra`, then `extra` does not contain the first element of `a`. Otherwise, if the first element of `a` is in `done`, then `todo` includes the first element of `a`. Otherwise, `todo`, `done`, and `extra` do not include the first element of `a`. If the element at index `r` of `a` is in `todo`, then `todo` does not include the element at index `r` of `a` and `done` includes the element at index `r` of `a`. Otherwise, `extra` includes the element at index `r` of `a`. If the element at index `r - m` of `a` is in `done`, then `todo` includes the element at index `r - m` of `a` and `done` does not include the element at index `r - m` of `a`. Otherwise, `todo` does not include the element at index `r - m` of `a` and `done` includes the element at index `r - m` of `a`.**
