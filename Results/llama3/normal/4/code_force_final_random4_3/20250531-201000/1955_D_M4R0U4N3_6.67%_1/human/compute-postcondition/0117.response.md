Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 1, `j` is `m`, `r` is `n`, `stdin` is empty. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is `n - m + 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `n - m`. If `a[r - m]` is in `done`, `todo` contains `a[r - m]` and `done` does not contain `a[r - m]`. If `a[r - m]` is in `extra`, then `a[r - m]` is not in `extra`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` does not contain `a[r]` and `done` contains `a[r]`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `extra` contains `a[r]`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The loop has iterated `n - m` times.
*   The value of `r` is now `n`.
*   If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is incremented by `n - m + 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by `n - m`.
*   If `a[r - m]` is in `done`, it is moved to `todo`. If `a[r - m]` is in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`.
*   If `a[r]` is in `todo`, it is moved to `done`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`.

The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
