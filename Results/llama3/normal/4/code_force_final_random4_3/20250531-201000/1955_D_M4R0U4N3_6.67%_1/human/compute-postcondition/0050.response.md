Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 0, `j` is `m+2`, `r` is `m+2`, `old` is `a[2]`, `ans` is 3 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 2, stdin contains 0 test cases. If `old` is in `done`, then `todo` contains `old` and `done` does not contain `old`, and `ans` is 3 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k-1`, otherwise `ans` is 2.***
