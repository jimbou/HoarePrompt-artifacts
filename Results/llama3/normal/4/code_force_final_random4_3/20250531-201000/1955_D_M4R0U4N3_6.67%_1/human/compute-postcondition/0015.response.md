Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `j` is 2, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains 0 test cases. If `a[2]` is in `todo`, then `todo` has one element removed, `done` has one element added which is `a[2]`, and `a` is a list of integers with `a[2]` removed. Otherwise, `a[2]` is added to `extra` and `a` remains unchanged.***
