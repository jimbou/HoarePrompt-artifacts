Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, m, and k, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, and a list of m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m. 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5. 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    todo = set(map(int, input().split()))
    done = set()
    extra = set()
    for j in range(m):
        if a[j] in todo:
            todo.remove(a[j])
            done.add(a[j])
        else:
            extra.add(a[j])
    ans = 1 if len(done) >= k else 0
    for r in range(m, n):
        old = a[r - m]
        if old in extra:
            extra.remove(old)
        elif old in done:
            done.remove(old)
            todo.add(old)
        if a[r] in todo:
            todo.remove(a[r])
            done.add(a[r])
        else:
            extra.add(a[r])
        if len(done) >= k:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, m is an integer that is less than n, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers, done is a set of integers, extra is a set of integers, _ is 0, j is n, ans is the number of elements in done if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is the number of elements in done, stdin contains 0 test cases, r is n, and the value of ans is being printed which is the number of elements in done if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is the number of elements in done

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 1, `j` is `m`, `r` is `n`, `stdin` is empty. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is `n - m + 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `n - m`. If `a[r - m]` is in `done`, `todo` contains `a[r - m]` and `done` does not contain `a[r - m]`. If `a[r - m]` is in `extra`, then `a[r - m]` is not in `extra`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` does not contain `a[r]` and `done` contains `a[r]`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `extra` contains `a[r]`, and ans is printed which is either `n - m + 1` or `n - m` depending on whether the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k` or not

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 2, `j` is `m`, `r` is `n`, `ans` is the number of elements in `done` that are greater than or equal to `k`. If the element at index `r - m` of `a` is in `extra`, then `extra` does not include the element at index `r - m` of `a`. Otherwise, if the element at index `r - m` of `a` is in `done`, then `todo` includes the element at index `r - m` of `a` and `done` does not include the element at index `r - m` of `a`. Otherwise, `todo` does not include the element at index `r - m` of `a` and `done` includes the element at index `r - m` of `a`. The element at index `r` of `a` is either in `done` or `extra`, and the number of elements in `done` that are greater than or equal to `k` is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
