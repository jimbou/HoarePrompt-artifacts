The code snippet provided modifies the sets `todo` and `done` based on the value of `a[j]`. Here's the combined effect of all lines on the program:

The first line removes the current value of `a[j]` from the set `todo`. Since `a[j]` is initially in the set `todo`, this operation reduces the size of `todo` by 1.

The second line adds the current value of `a[j]` to the set `done`. This operation increases the size of `done` by 1.

No other variables are affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **n is an integer, m is greater than 0, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers with one less element, done is a set containing the current value of a[j], extra is an empty set, _ is 0, stdin contains 0 test cases, j is 0.**
