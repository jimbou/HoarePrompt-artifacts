Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that is at least 2, `m` is an integer that is at least 1 and less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 2, `j` is 0, `r` is `n`, `stdin` is empty. If the first element of `a` is in `todo`, then `todo` has one less element and `done` contains the value of the first element of `a`. Otherwise, `todo` remains unchanged and `extra` contains the first element of `a` which is not in `todo` or `done`.***
