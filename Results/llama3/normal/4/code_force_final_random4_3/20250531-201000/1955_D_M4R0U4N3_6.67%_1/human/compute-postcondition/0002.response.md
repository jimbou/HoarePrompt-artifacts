According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `m` is an integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `m` is greater than 0 and `j` is now 0.

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains 0 test cases, `j` is 0**
