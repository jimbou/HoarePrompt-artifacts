Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer that is less than n, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers containing old, done is a set of integers not containing old, extra is a set of integers, _ is 0, j is m+2, r is m+2, old is a[2], ans is 3 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k-1, otherwise ans is 2, stdin contains 0 test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `extra`, `_`, `j`, `r`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `old` is still `a[2]`. The set `done` no longer contains `old`, and the set `todo` now contains `old`. The value of `ans` depends on the number of elements in `done`, which is now one less than its original value.
