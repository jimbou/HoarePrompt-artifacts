Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains 0 test cases, `j` is 0. If `a[j]` is in `todo`, then `todo` has one less element and `done` contains the current value of `a[j]`. Otherwise, `todo` remains unchanged, `done` is empty, and `extra` contains the element at index `j` of `a`.***
