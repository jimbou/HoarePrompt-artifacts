Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer that is less than n, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers, done is an empty set, extra is an empty set, _ is 2, j is m, r is n, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    if a[j] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[j])
        done.add(a[j])
    else:
        extra.add(a[j])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer that is at least 2, `m` is an integer that is at least 1 and less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 2, `j` is 0, `r` is `n`, `stdin` is empty. If the first element of `a` is in `todo`, then `todo` has one less element and `done` contains the value of the first element of `a`. Otherwise, `todo` remains unchanged and `extra` contains the first element of `a` which is not in `todo` or `done`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer that is at least 2, `m` is an integer that is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `j` is 1, `r` is `n`, `_` is 2, `stdin` is empty. If the first element of `a` is in `todo`, then `todo` has one less element and `done` contains the value of the first element of `a`. Otherwise, `todo` remains unchanged and `extra` contains the first element of `a` which is not in `todo` or `done`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer that is at least 2, `m` is an integer that is at least 3, `k` is an integer, `j` is 2, `r` is `n`, `_` is 2, and `stdin` is empty. If the third element of `a` is in `todo`, then `a` has the third element removed, `todo` has one less element (the one that was at index 2 in `a`), and `done` contains the value that was at index 2 in `a`, and `extra` is unchanged. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged, `todo` remains unchanged, `done` remains unchanged, and `extra` contains the third element of `a` which is not in `todo` or `done`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
