Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 1, `j` is `m`, `r` is `m+1`, `old` is `a[0]`, `stdin` is empty. If `old` is in `done`, then `todo` contains `old` and `done` does not contain `old`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.***
