The only variable in the loop head is variable `r`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `r` and `n`. If `r` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is `m+1`, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`. For the loop to execute again `r` must be increased by 1 so `r` is `m+2` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `m+2`.
State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 0, `j` is `m+2`, `ans` is 3 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 2, stdin contains 0 test cases, `r` is `m+2`, `old` is `a[r - m]`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` contains all elements it had before except `a[r]`, `done` contains all elements it had before plus `a[r]`, and `extra` contains `a[r]` if `a[r]` is not in `todo`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `todo` contains `a[0]` if `a[0]` is not in `done` and `a[0]` is not in `extra`, otherwise `todo` is an empty set, `done` contains all elements it had before except `a[0]` if `a[0]` is in `done` and `a[0]` is in `extra`, otherwise `done` remains unchanged, and `extra` contains `a[r]` and `a[r]` is not in `todo`.**
