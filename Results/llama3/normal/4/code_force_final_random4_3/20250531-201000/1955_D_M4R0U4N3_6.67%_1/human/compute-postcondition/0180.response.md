Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer that is less than n, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers, done is a set of integers, extra is a set of integers, _ is the number of test cases, j is m, r is n, ans is the number of elements in done that are greater than or equal to k, stdin is empty. If the element at index r - m of a is in extra, then extra does not include the element at index r - m of a. Otherwise, if the element at index r - m of a is in done, then todo includes the element at index r - m of a and done does not include the element at index r - m of a. Otherwise, todo does not include the element at index r - m of a and done includes the element at index r - m of a. The element at index r of a is either in done or extra, and the number of elements in done that are greater than or equal to k is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all test cases, and the final state of the variables is as follows: n, m, and k are integers, a is a list of integers, todo, done, and extra are sets of integers, and _ is the number of test cases. The loop has finished iterating over all test cases, and the final values of j and r are m and n, respectively. The value of ans is the number of elements in done that are greater than or equal to k, which is printed as the output. The stdin is empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
