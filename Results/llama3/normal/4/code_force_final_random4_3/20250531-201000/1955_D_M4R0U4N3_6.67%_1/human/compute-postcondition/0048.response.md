Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers with `a[2]` removed, `_` is 0, `j` is `m+2`, `ans` is 3 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 2, stdin contains 0 test cases, `r` is `m+2`, `old` is not defined because it was removed from `extra`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the element `a[2]` has been removed from the set `extra`. All other variables remain unchanged.
