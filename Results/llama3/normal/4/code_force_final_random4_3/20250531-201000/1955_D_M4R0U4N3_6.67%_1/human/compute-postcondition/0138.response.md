To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `r`, `m`, and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `m` is less than `n`. Since `r` is the loop variable, it should be initialized to `m` for the loop to start.

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 2, `j` is `m`, `r` is `m`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `stdin` is empty**
