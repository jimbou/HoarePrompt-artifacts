Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is an empty set, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers that does not contain `a[0]`, `_` is 0, `j` is `m`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, stdin contains 0 test cases, `r` is `m`, `old` is `a[0]`.**

The code removes the current value of `old` from the set `extra`. The value of `old` is `a[0]`, which is the first element of the list `a`. After the removal, the set `extra` no longer contains `a[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
