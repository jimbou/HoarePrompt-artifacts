Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer that is less than n, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers with a[r] removed, done is a set of integers with a[r] added, extra is a set of integers, _ is 0, j is m+2, r is m+2, ans is 3 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is 2, stdin contains 0 test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `_`, `j`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The set `todo` has the element `a[r]` removed, and the set `done` has the element `a[r]` added. The set `extra` remains unchanged as there is no operation performed on it. The value of `ans` is determined based on the number of elements in `done` and the value of `k`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 3; otherwise, `ans` is 2. The stdin remains empty as there are no test cases.
