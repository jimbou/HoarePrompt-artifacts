Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    b, c = map(int, input().split())
    q = b, c
    if b == c:
        print('YES')
    elif b < c:
        print('NO')
    elif a % 2 == b % 2:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *a is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, i is 0, b is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, q is a tuple containing two integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). If b is equal to c, 'YES' is printed. If b is not equal to c, then if b is less than c, 'NO' is printed. If b is larger than or equal to c, then if a and b have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *a is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, i is 1, b is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, q is a tuple containing two integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). If b is equal to c, 'YES' is being printed. If b is not equal to c, then if b is less than c, 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, if a and b have the same parity, 'Yes' is being printed. Otherwise, 'No' is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *a is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, i is 2, b is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, q is a tuple containing two integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). If b is equal to c, 'YES' is printed. If b is not equal to c, then if b is less than c, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if a and b have the same parity, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
