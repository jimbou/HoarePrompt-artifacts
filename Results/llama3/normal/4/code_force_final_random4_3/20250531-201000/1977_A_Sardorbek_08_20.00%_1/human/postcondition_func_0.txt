This function reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and m. It then checks each pair of integers and prints 'YES' if they are equal, 'NO' if the first integer is less than the second, or 'YES' if the first integer and the total number of pairs have the same parity, and 'NO' otherwise. The function consumes all input lines and does not return any value.
