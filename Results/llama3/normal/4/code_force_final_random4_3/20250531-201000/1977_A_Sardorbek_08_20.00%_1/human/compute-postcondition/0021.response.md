Output State: **a is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, i is 1, b is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, q is a tuple containing two integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100).**

The code reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to b and c, respectively. It then creates a tuple q containing these two integers. The values of a and i remain unchanged. The number of lines in stdin decreases by 1.
