Postcondition: ***a is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, i is 0, b is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, q is a tuple containing two integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100), and b is not equal to c. If b is less than c, 'NO' is printed. If b is larger than or equal to c, then if a and b have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.***
