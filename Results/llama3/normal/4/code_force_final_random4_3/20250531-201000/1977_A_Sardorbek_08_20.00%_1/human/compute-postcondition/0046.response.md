Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, i is a-1, b is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, q is a tuple containing two integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains 0 lines. If b is equal to c, 'YES' is printed. If b is not equal to c, then if b is less than c, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if a and b have the same parity, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the variables have reached their final values. The loop counter `i` has reached `a-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `a` times. The values of `b` and `c` are still integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, and `q` is still a tuple containing two integers between 1 and 100 inclusive. The stdin contains 0 lines, indicating that all input lines have been processed. The output state also describes the final output of the loop, which depends on the values of `b` and `c`, and their parity with `a`.
