Output State: **a is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, i is 2, b is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, q is a tuple containing two integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100).**

The code snippet reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `b` and `c`, respectively. It then creates a tuple `q` containing the values of `b` and `c`. The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged. The state of stdin is updated to reflect that two lines have been read. The parity of `a` and `b` is not modified by the code, so the condition for printing 'Yes' or 'No' remains the same.
