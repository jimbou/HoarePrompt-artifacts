Postcondition: ***a is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, i is 1, b is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, q is a tuple containing two integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). If a and b have the same parity, 'Yes' is being printed. Otherwise, 'No' is being printed.***
