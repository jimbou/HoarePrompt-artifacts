The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `a` must be greater than 1.
State: **a is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, i is 1, b is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, q is a tuple containing two integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). If b is equal to c, 'YES' is printed. If b is not equal to c, then if b is less than c, 'NO' is printed. If b is larger than or equal to c, then if a and b have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
