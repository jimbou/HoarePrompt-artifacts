Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is 5 3, the program prints 'Yes' because 5 % 2 == 3 % 2, but this is incorrect. The correct answer should be 'Yes' because Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times and then remove 2 cubes to get a tower with 3 cubes.

The program only checks if the number of moves (b) is equal to the number of cubes (c), or if the number of moves is less than the number of cubes. It does not consider the case where the number of moves is greater than the number of cubes, but still allows Nikita to build a tower with the desired number of cubes by adding and removing cubes.

A correct solution would need to check if the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes is even, because Nikita can only add or remove cubes in pairs.
