Postcondition: ***a is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, i is 2, b is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, q is a tuple containing two integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). If b is less than c, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if a and b have the same parity, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.***
