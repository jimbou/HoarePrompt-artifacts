Output State: **T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is a positive integer, k is 0, a is a list of n integers, l is a non-negative integer less than n, r is a non-negative integer less than n, ans is a non-negative integer less than n and is equal to its original value plus 0, mi is the minimum value between the first and last elements of the list a, stdin contains no input. The current values of l and r are equal.**

In this output state, the value of ans has been updated to its original value plus 0, because k is 0 and a[l] is an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.
