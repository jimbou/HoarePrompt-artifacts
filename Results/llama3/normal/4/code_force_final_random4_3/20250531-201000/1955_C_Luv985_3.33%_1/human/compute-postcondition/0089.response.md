Output State: **`T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `T` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer greater than 2 * `mi`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is either 1, 2 or 3, `mi` is the minimum value between the first and last elements of the list `a` which is `min(a[0], a[n-1])`, `t` is either 0 or 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 1, 2, or 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
