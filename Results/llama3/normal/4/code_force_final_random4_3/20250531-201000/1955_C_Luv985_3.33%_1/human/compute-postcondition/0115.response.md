Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and T is greater than 0, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], mi * 2 is larger than k, and t is either 0 or 1. If mi minus t minus k divided by 2 equals 0, then ans is 1. Otherwise, ans remains 0.***
