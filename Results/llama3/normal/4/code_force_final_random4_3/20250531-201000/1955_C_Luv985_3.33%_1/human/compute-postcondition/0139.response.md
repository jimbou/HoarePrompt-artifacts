Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and `T` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is less than `r`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `mi` equals `min(a[l], a[r])`, `t` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `k` is even or odd. If `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0, then `ans` is increased by 1.***
