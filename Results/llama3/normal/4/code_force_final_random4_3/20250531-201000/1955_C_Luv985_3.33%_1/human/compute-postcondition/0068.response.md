Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, mi is the minimum value between the first and last elements of the list a, stdin contains no input. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is updated to its original value minus 2 times mi, the first and last elements of a are decreased by mi. If the first element of a is 0, then l is 1, r is n - 1, ans is 1, and the current value of the first element of a is -mi. If the last element of a is 0, then l is 1, r is n - 2, ans is 2, otherwise, l, r, and ans remain unchanged with ans being 1 more than its original value, and the current value of the first element of a is -mi, and the current value of the last element of a is 0. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
