Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and T is greater than 0, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer and must be at least 2 * min(a[0], a[n-1]) - 1, a is a list of n integers with a[l] and a[r] reduced by mi, l is less than r, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], if a[l] is 0, ans is 1 and l is increased by 1. Otherwise, ans remains 0.***
