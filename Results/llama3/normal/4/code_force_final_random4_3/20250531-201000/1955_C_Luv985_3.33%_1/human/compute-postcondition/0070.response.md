Output State: **`T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `T` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n` - 1, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between the first and last elements of the list `a` which is `min(a[0], a[n-1])`, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `mi` has been updated to be the minimum value between the first and last elements of the list `a`, which are `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
