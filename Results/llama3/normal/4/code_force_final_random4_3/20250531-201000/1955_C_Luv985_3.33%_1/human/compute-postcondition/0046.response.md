Output State: **T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is a positive integer, k is 0, a is a list of n integers, l is equal to r, ans is a positive integer less than or equal to n and is equal to its original value plus 0 since k is 0 and is less than any integer in list a, stdin contains no input, and the current value of l is equal to the current value of r.**

In natural language, the output state is: T is still a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is still a positive integer, k is still 0, a is still a list of n integers, l is still equal to r, ans is still a positive integer less than or equal to n but its value is increased by 0 because k is 0 and is less than any integer in list a, stdin still contains no input, and the current value of l is still equal to the current value of r.
