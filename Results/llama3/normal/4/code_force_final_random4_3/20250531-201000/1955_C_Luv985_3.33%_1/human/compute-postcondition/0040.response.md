Output State: **`T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is greater than 0 and `r` is greater than `l`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `t` is either 0 or 1, `ans` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state are still valid, but the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
