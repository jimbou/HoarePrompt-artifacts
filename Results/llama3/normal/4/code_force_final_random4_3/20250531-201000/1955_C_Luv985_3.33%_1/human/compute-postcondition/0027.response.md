Output State: **T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, l is either 0 or 1, r is greater than l, ans is either 0, 1 or 2, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], t is either 0 or 1, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of t is determined by the remainder of k divided by 2, which can be either 0 or 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
