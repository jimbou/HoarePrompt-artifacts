Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer greater than 1 minus 2 times the minimum value between the first and last elements of the list a, a is a list of n integers with the first and last elements decreased by the minimum value between the first and last elements of the list a, if the first element of the list a is 0, then l is 1, r is n - 1, ans is 1, otherwise l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, mi is the minimum value between the first and last elements of the list a which is min(a[0], a[n-1]), stdin contains no input.***
