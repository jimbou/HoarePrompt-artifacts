Output State: **T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, mi is the minimum value between the first and last elements of the list a, t is either 0 or 1, stdin contains no input. The product of mi and 2 is larger than k**

In this output state, the value of t is either 0 or 1, which is the remainder of k divided by 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
