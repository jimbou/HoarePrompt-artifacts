According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable T. If T is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and T is greater than 0. T being greater than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to T is greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and T is greater than 1, n is a positive integer, k is 0, a is a list of n integers, l is a non-negative integer less than n, r is a non-negative integer less than n, ans is a non-negative integer less than n. If the current values of l and r are equal, then ans is equal to its original value plus 0, and ans is printed**
