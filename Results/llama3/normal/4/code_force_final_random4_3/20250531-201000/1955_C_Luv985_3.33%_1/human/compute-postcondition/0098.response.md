Output: **T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is a positive integer, k is 0, a is a list of n integers, l is a non-negative integer less than n, r is a non-negative integer less than n, ans is a non-negative integer less than n. If the current values of l and r are equal, then ans is equal to its original value plus 0, and ans is printed**
