Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, l is either 0 or 1, r is greater than 0 and r is greater than l, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], t is either 0 or 1. If the minimum of a[l] and a[r] minus t minus k divided by 2 equals 0, then ans is increased by 1.***
