Postcondition: **T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, l is either 0 or 1, r is either n-1 or n-2, ans is either 0, 1 or 2, mi is the minimum of the first and last elements of the list a, stdin contains no input. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is equal to its original value minus twice the minimum of the first and last elements of the list a, the first and last elements of the list a are decreased by the minimum of the first and last elements of the list a. If the first element of the list a is 0, then l is 1, r is n-1, ans is 1. If the last element of the list a is 0, then l is 1, r is n-2, ans is 2. Otherwise, the values of l, r, ans, and mi remain unchanged. If mi * 2 is larger than k, then the minimum of the first and last elements of the list a multiplied by 2 is larger than k. If the current value of mi minus t minus k divided by 2 equals 0, then ans is 1. Otherwise, ans remains 0.**
