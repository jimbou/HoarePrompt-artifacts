Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, l is either 0 or 1, r is greater than 0 and r is greater than l, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r]. a[l] is decreased by mi, a[r] is decreased by mi, k is decreased by mi * 2. If a[l] is 0, then l is either 1 or 2, mi is the minimum of a[l-1] and a[r], a[l-1] is decreased by mi, a[r] is decreased by mi, k is decreased by mi * 2, ans is increased by 1.***
