Output State: **T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is a positive integer, k is 0, a is a list of n integers, l is equal to r, ans is a positive integer less than or equal to n, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that T remains unchanged, n remains unchanged, k becomes 0, a remains unchanged, l and r become equal, ans becomes a positive integer less than or equal to n, and stdin remains unchanged.
