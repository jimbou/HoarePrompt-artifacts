Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and T is greater than 0, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, l is less than r, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r] and mi equals min(a[l], a[r]). If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then a[l] and a[r] are less than or equal to 0. If a[r] equals 0, ans is increased by 2 and l is increased by 1, r is decreased by 1. If a[r] is not equal to 0, ans is increased by 1 and l is increased by 1. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then t is either 0 or 1 depending on whether k is even or odd. If mi - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
