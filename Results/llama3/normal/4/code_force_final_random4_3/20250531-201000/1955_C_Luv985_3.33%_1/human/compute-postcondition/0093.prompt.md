Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, mi is the minimum value between the first and last elements of the list a, stdin contains no input. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is updated to its original value minus 2 times mi, the first and last elements of a are decreased by mi. If the first element of a is 0, then l is 1, r is n - 1, ans is 1, and the current value of the first element of a is -mi. If the last element of a is 0, then l is 1, r is n - 2, ans is 2, otherwise, l, r, and ans remain unchanged with ans being 1 more than its original value, and the current value of the first element of a is -mi, and the current value of the last element of a is 0. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is either 0, 1 or 2, mi is the minimum value between the first and last elements of the list a which is min(a[0], a[n-1]), stdin contains no input. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is decreased by 2 times the minimum value between the first and last elements of the list a, the first and last elements of the list a are decreased by the minimum value between the first and last elements of the list a, and the values of l, r, ans are updated based on the values of the first and last elements of the list a. Otherwise, ans is either 0 or 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer greater than 2 * mi, a is a list of n integers, l and r are updated based on the values of the first and last elements of the list a, mi is the minimum value between the first and last elements of the list a which is min(a[0], a[n-1]), and ans is either 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, the first and last elements of the list a are decreased by mi, and l and r are updated accordingly. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then if mi - t - k // 2 equals 0, ans is either 1, 2 or 3, otherwise ans is either 0, 1 or 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
