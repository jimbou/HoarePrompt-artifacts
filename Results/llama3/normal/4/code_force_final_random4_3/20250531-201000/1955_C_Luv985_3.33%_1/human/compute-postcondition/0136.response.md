Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and T is greater than 0, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of n integers, l is less than r, a[l] is less than or equal to 0, a[r] is less than or equal to 0, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r] and mi equals 0. If a[r] equals 0, ans is increased by 2 and l is increased by 1, r is decreased by 1. If a[r] is not equal to 0, ans is increased by 1 and l is increased by 1.***
