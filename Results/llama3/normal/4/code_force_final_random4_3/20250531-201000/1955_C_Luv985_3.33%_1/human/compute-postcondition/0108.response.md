Postcondition: **T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and T is greater than 0, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 times the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], a is a list of n integers where a[0] and a[n-1] are reduced by the minimum of their original values. The current value of a[l] is the second element of the list a. If a[0] is 0, then l is 1, r is n - 1, ans is 1, and mi is no longer defined as its value is used and not stored. Otherwise, the values of l, r, ans, and mi remain unchanged. Additionally, the current value of a[r] is 0.**
