Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus twice the minimum of the first and last elements of the list a, a is a list of n integers with the first and last elements decreased by the minimum of the first and last elements of the list a, if the first element of the list a is 0, then l is 1, r is n-1, ans is 1, mi is the minimum of the first and last elements of the list a, stdin contains no input. The current value of a[l] is the second element of the list a. Otherwise, the values of l, r, ans, and mi remain unchanged.***
