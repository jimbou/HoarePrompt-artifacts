Postcondition: **T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer greater than 2 * mi, a is a list of n integers with the first and last elements decreased by mi, if the first element of the list a is 0, then l is 1 and r is n - 1, ans is either 1, 2 or 3, otherwise, l is 0 and r is n - 1, ans is either 0, 1 or 2, mi is the minimum value between the first and last elements of the list a which is min(a[0], a[n-1])**
