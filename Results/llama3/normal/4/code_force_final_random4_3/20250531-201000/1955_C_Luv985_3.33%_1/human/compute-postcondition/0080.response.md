Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is either 0, 1 or 2, mi is the minimum value between the first and last elements of the list a which is min(a[0], a[n-1]), stdin contains no input. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is decreased by 2 times the minimum value between the first and last elements of the list a, the first and last elements of the list a are decreased by the minimum value between the first and last elements of the list a, and the values of l, r, ans are updated based on the values of the first and last elements of the list a. Otherwise, ans is either 0 or 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
