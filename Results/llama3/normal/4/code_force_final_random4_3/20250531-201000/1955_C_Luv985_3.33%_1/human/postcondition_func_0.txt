This function simulates a scenario where a Kraken attacks a fleet of ships. It takes as input the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the number of ships and the number of Kraken attacks. It then reads the durability of each ship. The function simulates the Kraken's attacks, starting from both ends of the fleet, and keeps track of the number of ships sunk. If a ship's durability is reduced to zero, it is considered sunk. The function continues the simulation until the Kraken's attacks are exhausted or all ships are sunk. Finally, it prints the total number of ships sunk.
