Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and T is greater than 0, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 times the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], a is a list of n integers where a[0] and a[n-1] are reduced by the minimum of their original values. If a[r] is 0, then a[l] is the second element of the list a, l is 1, r is n - 2, ans is 2, and mi is no longer defined. Otherwise, the values of l, r, ans, and mi remain unchanged. If a[0] is 0, then l is 1, r is n - 1, ans is 1, and mi is no longer defined.***
