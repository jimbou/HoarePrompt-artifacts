Output State: **T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, l is either 0 or 1, r is greater than 0 and r is greater than l, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], t is either 0 or 1. If the minimum of a[l] and a[r] minus t minus k divided by 2 equals 0, then ans is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables T, n, k, a, l, r, mi, and t remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The condition for increasing ans still holds, but since we break out of the loop, no further changes will be made to ans.
