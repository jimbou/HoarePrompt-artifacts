Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and T is greater than 0, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer and must be at least 2 * min(a[0], a[n-1]) + 1, a is a list of n integers, l is less than r, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r]. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then a is a list of n integers with a[l] and a[r] reduced by mi. If a[r] is 0, ans is 1 and r is reduced by 1. Otherwise, ans remains 0 and l is increased by 1 if a[l] is 0. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then if mi - T - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is 1. Otherwise, ans remains 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
