Output: **T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and T is greater than 0, n is a positive integer, k is 0, a is a list of n integers, if the original value of l is equal to the original value of r, then ans is a positive integer and is equal to its original value plus 0 because k is 0 and k >= a[l] is always false. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables, and ans is printed, ans is a positive integer and is equal to its original value plus 0 because k is 0 and k >= a[l] is always false.**
