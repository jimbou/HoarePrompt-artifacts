Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `T` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n` - 1, `mi` is the minimum value between the first and last elements of the list `a` which is `min(a[0], a[n-1])`, `t` is either 0 or 1 because `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, stdin contains no input. If `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
