Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, where n is the number of ships and k is the number of times the Kraken will attack the ships. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where a_i is the durability of the i-th ship.
Code of the loop:
while T:
    T -= 1
    n, k = input().split()
    n = int(n)
    k = int(k)
    a = input().split()
    a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    ans = 0
    while l < r and k > 0:
        mi = min(a[l], a[r])
        if mi * 2 <= k:
            a[l] -= mi
            a[r] -= mi
            k -= mi * 2
            if a[l] == 0:
                ans += 1
                l += 1
            if a[r] == 0:
                ans += 1
                r -= 1
        else:
            t = k % 2
            if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
                ans += 1
            break
    if l == r:
        ans += k >= a[l]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is a positive integer, k is 0, a is a list of n integers, l is equal to r, ans is a positive integer less than or equal to n and is equal to its original value plus 0 since k is 0 and is less than any integer in list a, stdin contains no input, and the current value of l is equal to the current value of r, and ans which is equal to its original value plus 0 since k is 0 and is less than any integer in list a is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is a positive integer, k is 0, a is a list of n integers, l is a non-negative integer less than n, r is a non-negative integer less than n, ans is a non-negative integer less than n. If the current values of l and r are equal, then ans is equal to its original value plus 0, and ans is printed
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and T is greater than 0, n is a positive integer, k is 0, a is a list of n integers, if the original value of l is equal to the original value of r, then ans is a positive integer and is equal to its original value plus 0 because k is 0 and k >= a[l] is always false. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables, and ans is printed, ans is a positive integer and is equal to its original value plus 0 because k is 0 and k >= a[l] is always false.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
