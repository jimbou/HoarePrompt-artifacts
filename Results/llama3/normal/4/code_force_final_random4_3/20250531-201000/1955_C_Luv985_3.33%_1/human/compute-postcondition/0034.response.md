Output State: **T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, l is either 0 or 1, r is greater than 0 and r is greater than l, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r]. a[l] is decreased by mi, a[r] is decreased by mi, k is decreased by mi * 2.**

In this output state, the values of T, n, l, and r remain unchanged. The list a is modified such that the elements at indices l and r are decreased by the minimum value mi. The value of k is also decreased by twice the minimum value mi. The minimum value mi remains the same, as it is calculated based on the original values of a[l] and a[r].
