stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, where n is the number of ships and k is the number of times the Kraken will attack the ships. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where a_i is the durability of the i-th ship.
