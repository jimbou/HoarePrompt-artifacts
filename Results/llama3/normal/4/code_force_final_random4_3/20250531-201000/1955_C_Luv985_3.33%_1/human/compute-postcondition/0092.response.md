Postcondition: **T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer greater than 2 * mi, a is a list of n integers, l and r are updated based on the values of the first and last elements of the list a, mi is the minimum value between the first and last elements of the list a which is min(a[0], a[n-1]), and ans is either 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, the first and last elements of the list a are decreased by mi, and l and r are updated accordingly. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then if mi - t - k // 2 equals 0, ans is either 1, 2 or 3, otherwise ans is either 0, 1 or 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
