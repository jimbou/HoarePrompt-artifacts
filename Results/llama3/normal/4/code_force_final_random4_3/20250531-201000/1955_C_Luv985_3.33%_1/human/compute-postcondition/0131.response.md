Output State: **`T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and `T` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is less than `r`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `mi` equals `min(a[l], a[r])`.**

In natural language, the output state is: T remains a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and greater than 0, n remains a positive integer greater than 1, k remains greater than 0, a remains a list of n integers, l remains less than r, and mi is updated to be the minimum of a[l] and a[r], which is now equal to min(a[l], a[r]).
