The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is a positive integer less than or equal to `n` and is equal to its original value plus 0 since `k` is 0 and is less than any integer in list `a`.

Since `ans` is equal to its original value plus 0, it means that `ans` has not changed from its original value. The original value of `ans` is not explicitly stated, but it is described as a positive integer less than or equal to `n`.

Therefore, the output will be the original value of `ans`, which is a positive integer less than or equal to `n`.

Output: **a positive integer less than or equal to n (which is the original value of ans)**
