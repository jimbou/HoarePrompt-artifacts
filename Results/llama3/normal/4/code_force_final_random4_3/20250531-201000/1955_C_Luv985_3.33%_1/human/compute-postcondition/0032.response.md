The variables in the loop head are l and r and k, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables l, r and k. If l is less than r and k is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, l is either 0, 1 or 2, r is greater than l and k is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to be executed one more time, l must be less than r and k must be greater than 0. Since l is either 0, 1 or 2 and r is greater than l, l must be less than 2 and r must be greater than 0. Also, k must be greater than 0.
State: **T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, l is either 0 or 1, r is greater than 0 and r is greater than l.**
