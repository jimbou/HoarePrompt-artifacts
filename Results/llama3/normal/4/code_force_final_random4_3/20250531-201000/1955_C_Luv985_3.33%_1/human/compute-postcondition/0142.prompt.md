Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and T is greater than 0, n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and T is greater than 0, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], ans is 0. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is equal to its original value minus 2 times the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], a is a list of n integers where a[0] and a[n-1] are reduced by the minimum of their original values. If a[r] is 0, then a[l] is the second element of the list a, l is 1, r is n - 2, ans is 2, and mi is no longer defined. Otherwise, the values of l, r, ans, and mi remain unchanged. If a[0] is 0, then l is 1, r is n - 1, ans is 1, and mi is no longer defined. If mi * 2 is larger than k, then mi * 2 is larger than k, t is either 0 or 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If mi minus t minus k divided by 2 equals 0, then ans is 1. Otherwise, ans remains 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and T is greater than 0, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer and must be at least 2 * min(a[0], a[n-1]) + 1, a is a list of n integers, l is less than r, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r]. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then a is a list of n integers with a[l] and a[r] reduced by mi. If a[r] is 0, ans is 1 and r is reduced by 1. Otherwise, ans remains 0 and l is increased by 1 if a[l] is 0. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then if mi - T - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is 1. Otherwise, ans remains 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and T is greater than 0, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, l is less than r, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r] and mi equals min(a[l], a[r]). If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then a[l] and a[r] are less than or equal to 0. If a[r] equals 0, ans is increased by 2 and l is increased by 1, r is decreased by 1. If a[r] is not equal to 0, ans is increased by 1 and l is increased by 1. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then t is either 0 or 1 depending on whether k is even or odd. If mi - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
