Output State: **T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0 minus 2 times the minimum of a[l] and a[r], a is a list of n integers with a[l] and a[r] decreased by the minimum of a[l] and a[r], l is either 1 or 2, r is greater than l, ans is either 1, 2 or 3, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], stdin contains no input.**

The code increments `ans` by 1, making it either 1, 2, or 3. The second line increments `l` by 1, making it either 1 or 2. No other variables are affected.
