Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer greater than 2 * mi, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, mi is the minimum value between the first and last elements of the list a which is min(a[0], a[n-1]), t is either 0 or 1. If mi - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is either 1, 2 or 3. Otherwise, ans is either 0, 1 or 2.***
