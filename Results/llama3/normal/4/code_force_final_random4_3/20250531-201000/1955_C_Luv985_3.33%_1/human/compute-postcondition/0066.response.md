Postcondition: **T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, mi is the minimum value between the first and last elements of the list a, t is either 0 or 1, stdin contains no input. The product of mi and 2 is larger than k. If mi minus t minus k divided by 2 equals 0, then ans is 1. Otherwise, ans remains 0.**
