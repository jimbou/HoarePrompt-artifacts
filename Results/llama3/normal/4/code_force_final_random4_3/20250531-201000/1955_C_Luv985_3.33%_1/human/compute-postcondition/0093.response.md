Output State: **T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is a positive integer, k is 0, a is a list of n integers, l is a non-negative integer less than n, r is a non-negative integer less than n, ans is a non-negative integer less than n, mi is the minimum value between the first and last elements of the list a, stdin contains no input.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the loop has finished executing. In this state, the value of T remains unchanged, n remains a positive integer, k is 0, a is a list of n integers, l and r are non-negative integers less than n, ans is a non-negative integer less than n, and mi is the minimum value between the first and last elements of the list a. The stdin contains no input.
