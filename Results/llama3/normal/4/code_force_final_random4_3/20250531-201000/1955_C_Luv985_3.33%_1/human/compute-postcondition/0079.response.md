Output State: **`T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `T` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n` - 1, `mi` is the minimum value between the first and last elements of the list `a` which is `min(a[0], a[n-1])`, `t` is either 0 or 1 because `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `ans` is either 0 or 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is:  All the variables retain their original values and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
