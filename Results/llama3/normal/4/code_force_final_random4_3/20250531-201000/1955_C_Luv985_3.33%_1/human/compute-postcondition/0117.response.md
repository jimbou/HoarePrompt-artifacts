Postcondition: **T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and T is greater than 0, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], ans is 0. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is equal to its original value minus 2 times the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], a is a list of n integers where a[0] and a[n-1] are reduced by the minimum of their original values. If a[r] is 0, then a[l] is the second element of the list a, l is 1, r is n - 2, ans is 2, and mi is no longer defined. Otherwise, the values of l, r, ans, and mi remain unchanged. If a[0] is 0, then l is 1, r is n - 1, ans is 1, and mi is no longer defined. If mi * 2 is larger than k, then mi * 2 is larger than k, t is either 0 or 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If mi minus t minus k divided by 2 equals 0, then ans is 1. Otherwise, ans remains 0.**
