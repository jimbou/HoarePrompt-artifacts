Postcondition: **T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and T is greater than 0, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 times mi, a is a list of n integers where the first and last elements are decreased by mi. If the first element of a is 0, then l is 1, r is n - 1, ans is 1, and the current value of the first element of a is -mi. Otherwise, the values of l, r, and ans remain unchanged. Additionally, the current value of the last element of a is 0.**
