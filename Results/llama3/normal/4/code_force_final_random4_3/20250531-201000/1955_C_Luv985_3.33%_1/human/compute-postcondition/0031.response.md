Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, l is either 0, 1 or 2, r is greater than l. If the minimum of a[l] and a[r] times 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is decreased by 2 times the minimum of a[l] and a[r], a[l] and a[r] are decreased by the minimum of a[l] and a[r]. If a[r] is 0, r is decreased by 1 and ans is either 1, 2, 3 or 4. If a[l] is 0, l is either 1 or 2, otherwise l is either 0 or 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the minimum of a[l] and a[r] minus t minus k divided by 2 equals 0, then ans is either 1, 2 or 3. Otherwise, ans remains either 0, 1 or 2. stdin contains no input.***
