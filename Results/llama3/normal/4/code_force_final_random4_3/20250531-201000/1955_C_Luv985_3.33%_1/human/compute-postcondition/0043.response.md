Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, l is either 0, 1 or 2, r is greater than 0 and r is greater than l, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r] or the minimum of a[l-1] and a[r] if a[l] is 0. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is equal to its original value minus 2 * mi, a[l] and a[r] are either 0 or their original values minus mi, r is either equal to its original value or equal to its original value minus 1, and ans is its original value plus 1 if a[r] is 0 otherwise ans is its original value. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then if the minimum of a[l] and a[r] minus t minus k divided by 2 equals 0, then ans is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
