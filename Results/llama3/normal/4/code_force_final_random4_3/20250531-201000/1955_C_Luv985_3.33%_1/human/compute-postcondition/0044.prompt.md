Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is a positive integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n-1, ans is 0, stdin contains no input
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, l is either 0 or 1, r is either n-1 or n-2, ans is either 0, 1 or 2, mi is the minimum of the first and last elements of the list a, stdin contains no input. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is equal to its original value minus twice the minimum of the first and last elements of the list a, the first and last elements of the list a are decreased by the minimum of the first and last elements of the list a. If the first element of the list a is 0, then l is 1, r is n-1, ans is 1. If the last element of the list a is 0, then l is 1, r is n-2, ans is 2. Otherwise, the values of l, r, ans, and mi remain unchanged. If mi * 2 is larger than k, then the minimum of the first and last elements of the list a multiplied by 2 is larger than k. If the current value of mi minus t minus k divided by 2 equals 0, then ans is 1. Otherwise, ans remains 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, l is either 0, 1 or 2, r is greater than l. If the minimum of a[l] and a[r] times 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is decreased by 2 times the minimum of a[l] and a[r], a[l] and a[r] are decreased by the minimum of a[l] and a[r]. If a[r] is 0, r is decreased by 1 and ans is either 1, 2, 3 or 4. If a[l] is 0, l is either 1 or 2, otherwise l is either 0 or 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the minimum of a[l] and a[r] minus t minus k divided by 2 equals 0, then ans is either 1, 2 or 3. Otherwise, ans remains either 0, 1 or 2. stdin contains no input.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *T is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, l is either 0, 1 or 2, r is greater than 0 and r is greater than l, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r] or the minimum of a[l-1] and a[r] if a[l] is 0. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is equal to its original value minus 2 * mi, a[l] and a[r] are either 0 or their original values minus mi, r is either equal to its original value or equal to its original value minus 1, and ans is its original value plus 1 if a[r] is 0 otherwise ans is its original value. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then if the minimum of a[l] and a[r] minus t minus k divided by 2 equals 0, then ans is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
