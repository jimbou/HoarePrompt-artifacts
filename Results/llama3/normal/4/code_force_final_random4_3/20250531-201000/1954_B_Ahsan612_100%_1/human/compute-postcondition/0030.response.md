To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition, which is `i < len(ar)`. This means we need to focus on the states of `i` and `ar` since they are the variables involved in the loop condition.

1. **State of `i`**: Right before the loop, `i` is 1. This value does not prevent the loop from executing, as the condition only requires `i` to be less than the length of `ar`. Therefore, the state of `i` does not need to be adjusted.

2. **State of `ar`**: Right before the loop, `ar` is a list of integers. The loop condition requires `i` to be less than the length of `ar`. Since `i` is 1, for the loop to execute at least once, `ar` must have at least 2 elements (because the length of `ar` must be greater than 1). Therefore, the state of `ar` needs to be adjusted to ensure it has at least 2 elements.

Given this analysis, the adjusted state to ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed is:

State: **n is an integer, ar has at least 2 elements, same is 1, num is the first element of ar, minn is infinity, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, _ is 1**
