Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is either 1 or the length of the longest sequence of equal elements in `ar`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `stdin` contains 0 test cases, and `_` is equal to `t`. If the minimum of the length of the shortest sequence of equal elements in `ar` and `same` is either infinity or equal to the length of `ar`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum of the length of the shortest sequence of equal elements in `ar` and `same` is printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will be such that the loop has processed all the test cases (t) and the input buffer (stdin) is empty. The variables `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, and `i` will hold their respective values from the last iteration of the loop. The variable `_` will be equal to `t`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The output will be either -1 or the minimum length of the shortest sequence of equal elements in `ar`, depending on the value of `minn`.
