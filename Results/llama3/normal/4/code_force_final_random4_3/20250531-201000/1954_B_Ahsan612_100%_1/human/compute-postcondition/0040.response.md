Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `ar` has at least 3 elements, `minn` is either infinity or 1, `i` is less than len(ar), stdin contains t-3 test cases, and _ is 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 2 or 3, and `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the element at index `i+2` of `ar`, and `i` is either 2 or `i+2`. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the element at index `i+1` of `ar`, and `i` is either 3 or `i+3`.***
