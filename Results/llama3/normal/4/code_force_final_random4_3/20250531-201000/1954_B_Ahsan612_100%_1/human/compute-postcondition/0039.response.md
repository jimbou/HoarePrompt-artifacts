Output State: **n is an integer, ar has at least 3 elements, same is 1, num is the element at index i+1 of ar, minn is either infinity or 1, i is either 3 or i+3 and i is less than len(ar), stdin contains t-3 test cases, and _ is 1.**

In this final state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, making it either 3 or `i+3`. The value of `num` has been updated to the element at index `i+1` of `ar`. The value of `minn` has been updated to the minimum of its previous value and `same`, which is either infinity or 1. The value of `same` has been set to 1. The values of `n`, `ar`, `stdin`, and `_` remain unchanged.
