The only variable in the loop head is variable i and ar, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and ar.  If i is less than len(ar), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is either 2 or i+2, and ar has at least 2 elements. For the loop to be executed one more time, ar needed to have had at least 3 elements and i currently must be less than len(ar).
State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` has at least 3 elements, `same` is either 1 or 2, `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the element at index `i+2` of `ar`, `minn` is either infinity or 1, `i` is either 2 or `i+2` and `i` is less than len(ar), stdin contains t-3 test cases, and _ is 1.**
