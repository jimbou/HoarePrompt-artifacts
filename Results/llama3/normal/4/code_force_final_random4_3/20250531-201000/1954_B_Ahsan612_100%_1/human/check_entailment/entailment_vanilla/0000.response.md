Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. The program iterates through the array, counting the number of consecutive occurrences of the same number. It keeps track of the minimum count of consecutive occurrences, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
3. It initializes variables to keep track of the count of consecutive occurrences of the same number (`same`) and the minimum count (`minn`).
4. It iterates through the array, incrementing the count of consecutive occurrences of the same number (`same`) when it encounters the same number.
5. When it encounters a different number, it updates the minimum count (`minn`) if the current count (`same`) is less than the minimum count. It then resets the count (`same`) to 1 and updates the current number (`num`).
6. After iterating through the entire array, it updates the minimum count (`minn`) one last time if the last count (`same`) is less than the minimum count.
7. If the minimum count (`minn`) is equal to the length of the array or is infinity (indicating that the array consists of only one unique number), it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the minimum count (`minn`).

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
