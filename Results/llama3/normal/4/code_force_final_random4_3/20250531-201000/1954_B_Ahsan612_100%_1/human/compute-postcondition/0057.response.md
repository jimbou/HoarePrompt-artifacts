Output State: **n is an integer, ar is a list of integers, same is 1, num is the first element of ar, minn is infinity, i is 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, and _ is 2**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The code snippet reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `n`. It then reads a list of integers from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `ar`. The variable `same` is initialized to 1, and the variable `num` is set to the first element of the list `ar`. The variable `minn` is initialized to infinity, and the variable `i` is set to 1. The standard input now contains `t-5` test cases. The variable `_` remains unchanged and is still equal to 2.
