To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `i` and `ar` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i < len(ar)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 3, 4, or `i+3`, and `ar` is a list of integers with at least `i+1` elements.

To guarantee the loop can execute again, `i` must be less than the length of `ar`. Since `i` can be `i+3`, we need to ensure that `i+3` is less than the length of `ar`. Therefore, `ar` must have at least `i+4` elements.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least `i+4` elements, `same` is either 1, 2, or 3, `num` is either the first element of `ar`, the element of `ar` at index `i`, or the element of `ar` at index `i+2`, `minn` is either 1 or infinity, `i` is either 3, 4, or `i+3`, stdin contains t-5 test cases, and _ is 2.**
