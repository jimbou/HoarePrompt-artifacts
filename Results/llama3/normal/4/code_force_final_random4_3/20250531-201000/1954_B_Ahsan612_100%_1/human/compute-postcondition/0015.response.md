Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers with more than 5 elements, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `same` is either 2, 3, or 4, `num` is one of the first four elements of `ar`, `minn` is either positive infinity, 1, or its original value if it was less than 1, and `i` is either 3, 4, or 5. If `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `same` is 2, `num` is either the third or fourth element of `ar`, and `minn` is either 1 or its original value if it was less than 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `same` has been incremented by 1. If `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is now either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `same` is now 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
