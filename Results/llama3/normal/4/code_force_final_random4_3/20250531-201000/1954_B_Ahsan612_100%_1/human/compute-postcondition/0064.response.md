Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `same` is either 1 or 2, `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the element of `ar` at index `i+2`, `minn` is either infinity or 1, `i` is either 2 or `i+2`, stdin contains t-5 test cases, and _ is 2. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is updated to the element of `ar` at index `i+2`, `minn` is set to 1, and `i` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `same`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` are updated accordingly, considering the new value of `i`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
