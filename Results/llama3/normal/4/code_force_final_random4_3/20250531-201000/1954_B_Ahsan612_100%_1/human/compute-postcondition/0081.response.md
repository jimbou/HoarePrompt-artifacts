The code prints the value of `minn`, which is the minimum of the length of the shortest sequence of equal elements in the list `ar` and `same`. Since `same` is either 1 or the length of the longest sequence of equal elements in `ar`, `minn` will be the minimum of these two values.

Output: **the minimum of the length of the shortest sequence of equal elements in the list ar and same (where same is either 1 or the length of the longest sequence of equal elements in ar)**
