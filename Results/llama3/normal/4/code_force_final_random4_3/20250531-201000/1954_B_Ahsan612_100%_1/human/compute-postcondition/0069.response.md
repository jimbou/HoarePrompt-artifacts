Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least i+1 elements, `same` is either 1, 2, or 3, `num` is either the first element of `ar`, the element of `ar` at index `i`, or the element of `ar` at index `i+2`, `minn` is either 1 or infinity, `i` is either 3, 4, or `i+3`, stdin contains t-5 test cases, and _ is 2. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, `same` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the element of `ar` at index `i`, and `minn` is either 1 or its original value if it was less than 1.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 3, 4, or `i+3`. The other variables remain unchanged, but their relationships and constraints are still valid. For example, if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is still either 2 or 3, and if not, then `same` is 1, `num` is the element of `ar` at index `i`, and `minn` is either 1 or its original value if it was less than 1.
