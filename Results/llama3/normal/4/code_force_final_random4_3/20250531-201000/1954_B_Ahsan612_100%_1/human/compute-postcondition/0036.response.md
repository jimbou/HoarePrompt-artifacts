Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` has at least 2 elements, `same` is either 1 or 2, `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the element at index `i+2` of `ar`, `minn` is either infinity or 1, `i` is either 2 or `i+2`, stdin contains t-3 test cases, and _ is 1. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is updated to the element at index `i+2` of `ar`, `minn` is updated to 1, and `i` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, but their relationships and possible values have been updated accordingly. The value of `same` is still dependent on whether the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`. If they are equal, `same` is 2; otherwise, `same` is 1, and `num` and `minn` are updated accordingly. The number of test cases in stdin remains the same, and the value of `_` is still 1.
