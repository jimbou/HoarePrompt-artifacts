Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` has at least 3 elements, `same` is either 2 or 3, `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the element at index `i+2` of `ar`, `minn` is either infinity or 1, `i` is either 2 or `i+2` and `i` is less than len(ar), stdin contains t-3 test cases, and _ is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 2 or 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-3 test cases, and the value of `_` is still 1.
