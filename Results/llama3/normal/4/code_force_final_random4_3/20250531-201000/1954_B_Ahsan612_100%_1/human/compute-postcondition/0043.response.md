Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` has at least 3 elements, `minn` is either infinity or 1, `i` is either 3 or `i+3` or 2 or `i+2` and is less than `len(ar)-1`, stdin contains t-3 test cases, and _ is 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 3 or 4, and `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the element at index `i+2` of `ar`. Otherwise, `same` is 2, `num` is the element at index `i+1` of `ar`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `same` has been incremented by 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is now either 3 or 4, and `num` remains either the first element of `ar` or the element at index `i+2` of `ar`. Otherwise, `same` is now 2, and `num` remains the element at index `i+1` of `ar`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
