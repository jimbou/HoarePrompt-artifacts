Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least `i+4` elements, `same` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4, `num` is either the first element of `ar`, the element of `ar` at index `i`, or the element of `ar` at index `i+2`, `minn` is either 1 or infinity, `i` is either 3, 4, 5, or `i+3` or `i+4`, stdin contains t-5 test cases, and _ is 2. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, `same` is either 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the element of `ar` at index `i`, and `minn` is either 1 or the minimum of its original value and 1.***
