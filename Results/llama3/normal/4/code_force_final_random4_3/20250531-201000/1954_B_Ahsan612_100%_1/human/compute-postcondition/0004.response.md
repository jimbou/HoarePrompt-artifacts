Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `same` is 2, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `minn` is positive infinity, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0. The current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `same` being 2. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships. The list `ar` still has at least 2 elements, `num` is still the first element of `ar`, and `ar[i]` is still equal to `num`. The value of `minn` remains positive infinity, and `i` is still 1. Additionally, `stdin` still contains `t-1` test cases, and `_` remains 0.
