Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and 1. Since `minn` is neither infinite nor equal to the length of `ar`, we can conclude that `minn` is a finite integer.
* The previous value of `minn` is not explicitly stated, but since `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and 1, we can infer that the previous value of `minn` is either 1 or a value greater than 1.
* Since `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and 1, if the previous value of `minn` is 1, then `minn` will remain 1. If the previous value of `minn` is greater than 1, then `minn` will be set to 1.

Therefore, the value of `minn` that will be printed is either 1 or a value that is set to 1 due to the minimum operation.

Output: **1**
