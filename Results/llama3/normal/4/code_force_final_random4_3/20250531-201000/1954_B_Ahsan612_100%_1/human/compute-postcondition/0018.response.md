Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers with more than 5 elements, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `minn` is either positive infinity, 1, or its original value if it was less than 1, `i` is either 4, 5, 6, or 7, `num` is either the third, fourth, or fifth element of `ar`, and if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, `same` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be 4, 5, 6, or 7. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `minn`, `num`, and `same` are still valid, but now they are related to the new value of `i`.
