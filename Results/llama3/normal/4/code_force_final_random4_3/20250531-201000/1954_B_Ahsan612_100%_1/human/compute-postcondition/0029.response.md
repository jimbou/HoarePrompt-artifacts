Output State: **n is an integer, ar is a list of integers, same is 1, num is the first element of ar, minn is infinity, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, _ is 1**

The code first reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to n. Then, it reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to ar. The variable same is assigned the value 1. The variable num is assigned the first element of ar. The variable minn is assigned infinity. Finally, the variable i is assigned the value 1. The variable _ remains unchanged with a value of 1. The stdin now contains t-3 test cases.
