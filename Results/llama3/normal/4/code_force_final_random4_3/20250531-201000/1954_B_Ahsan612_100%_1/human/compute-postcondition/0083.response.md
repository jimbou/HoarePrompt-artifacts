Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is either 1 or the length of the longest sequence of equal elements in `ar`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, stdin contains t-5 test cases, and `_` is 2. If the minimum of the length of the shortest sequence of equal elements in `ar` and `same` is either infinity or equal to the length of `ar`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum of the length of the shortest sequence of equal elements in `ar` and `same` is printed.***
