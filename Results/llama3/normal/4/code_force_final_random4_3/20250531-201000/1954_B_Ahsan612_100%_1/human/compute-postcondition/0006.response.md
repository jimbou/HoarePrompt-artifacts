Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, ar is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, same is 1, num is the second element of ar, minn is 1, i is 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `num` has been updated to the second element of the list `ar`. The value of `minn` has been updated to 1, which is the minimum value between the previous value of `minn` (positive infinity) and `same` (1). The value of `same` has been reset to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
