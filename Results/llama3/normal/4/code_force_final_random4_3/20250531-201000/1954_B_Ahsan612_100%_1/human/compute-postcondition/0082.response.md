Output: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is either 1 or the length of the longest sequence of equal elements in `ar`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the length of the shortest sequence of equal elements in `ar` and `same`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, stdin contains t-5 test cases, and `_` is 2. `minn` is neither infinite nor equal to the length of `ar`, and the minimum of the length of the shortest sequence of equal elements in `ar` and `same` which is `minn` is being printed**
