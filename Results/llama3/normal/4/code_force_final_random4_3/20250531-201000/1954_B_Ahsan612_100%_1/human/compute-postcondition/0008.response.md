Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0. If the second element of `ar` is equal to the first element, then `same` is 2, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `minn` is positive infinity, and `i` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the second element of `ar`, `minn` is 1, and `i` is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `same`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` are still dependent on whether the second element of `ar` is equal to the first element.
