Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is 1, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum number of consecutive equal elements in `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will continue to iterate until it has processed all elements in the list `ar`. At the end of the loop, `same` will be reset to 1, `num` will be the last element of `ar`, and `minn` will be the minimum number of consecutive equal elements in `ar`. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of `ar`, indicating that all elements have been processed. The other variables, `n`, `stdin`, and `_`, remain unchanged.
