Output State: **n is an integer, ar is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, same is 1, num is the element of ar at index i+1, minn is 1, i is i+1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, and _ is 2.**

The code increments the value of `i` by 1, making it `i+1`. Then, it assigns the element of `ar` at the new index `i` to `num`. The value of `minn` is updated to be the minimum between its current value (infinity) and `same` (1), resulting in `minn` becoming 1. Finally, the value of `same` is reset to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
