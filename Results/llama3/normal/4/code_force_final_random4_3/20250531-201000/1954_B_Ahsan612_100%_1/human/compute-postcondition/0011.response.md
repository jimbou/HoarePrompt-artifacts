Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, ar is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0, same is 1, num is the third or fourth element of ar, minn is either 1 or the original value of minn if it was less than 1, and i is either 3 or 4.**

The code block modifies the values of `i`, `num`, `minn`, and `same`. The first line increments `i` by 1, making it either 3 or 4. The second line assigns the value of the element at index `i` in `ar` to `num`, making it either the third or fourth element of `ar`. The third line updates `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and `same`, which is either 1 or the original value of `minn` if it was less than 1. The fourth line assigns 1 to `same`. The other variables, `n`, `ar`, `stdin`, and `_`, remain unchanged.
