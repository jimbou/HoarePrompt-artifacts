To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition: `i < len(ar)`. This means we need to consider the values of `i` and `len(ar)`.

Right before the loop, `i` is 1, and `ar` is a list of integers. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than the length of `ar`. Since `i` is already 1, we need to ensure that `len(ar)` is at least 2.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the length of `ar`. We need to ensure that `ar` has at least 2 elements.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `same` is 1, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `minn` is positive infinity, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0**
