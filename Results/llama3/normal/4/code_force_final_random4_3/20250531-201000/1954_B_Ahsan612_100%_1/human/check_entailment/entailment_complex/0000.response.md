Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly, including the number of test cases, the size of each array, and the array elements themselves.
2. The program initializes the necessary variables, including `same` to keep track of the length of the current sequence of equal elements, `num` to store the current element, and `minn` to store the minimum length of the shortest sequence of equal elements.
3. The program iterates through the array, updating `same` and `num` as it encounters new elements. It also updates `minn` whenever it finds a shorter sequence of equal elements.
4. After iterating through the entire array, the program checks if `minn` is either infinity (indicating that the array contains only one unique element) or equal to the length of the array (indicating that the shortest sequence is the entire array). If either condition is true, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the minimum length of the shortest sequence of equal elements.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles the edge cases mentioned in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
