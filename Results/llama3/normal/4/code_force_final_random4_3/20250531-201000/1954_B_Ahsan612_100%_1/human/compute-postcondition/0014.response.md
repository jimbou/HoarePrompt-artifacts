The variables in the loop head are `i` and `ar`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `ar`. If `i` is less than `len(ar)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 3, 4, or 5, and `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`, so `len(ar)` must be greater than 5. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers with more than 5 elements, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `same` is either 1, 2, or 3, `num` is one of the first four elements of `ar`, `minn` is either positive infinity, 1, or its original value if it was less than 1, and `i` is either 3, 4, or 5. If `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is either the third or fourth element of `ar`, and `minn` is either 1 or its original value if it was less than 1.**
