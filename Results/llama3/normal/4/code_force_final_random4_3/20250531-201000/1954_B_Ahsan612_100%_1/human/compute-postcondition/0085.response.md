Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. It then finds the length of the shortest sequence of equal elements in the list and prints this length, unless the list contains only one unique element or the shortest sequence is the entire list, in which case it prints -1.**
