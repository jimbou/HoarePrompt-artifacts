The variable in the loop head is variable i and ar, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and ar.  If i is less than len(ar), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is either 2 or i+2 and ar is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, So for the loop to be executed one more time the length of ar needed to have been greater than i and ar currently must have at least i+1 elements.
State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least i+1 elements, `same` is either 1 or 2, `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the element of `ar` at index `i+2`, `minn` is either infinity or 1, `i` is either 2 or `i+2`, stdin contains t-5 test cases, and _ is 2.**
