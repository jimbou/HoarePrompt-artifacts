Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input array has only two distinct elements, and they are alternating. For example, the input [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] will return 1, but the correct answer is 2. The program only checks for the minimum length of consecutive elements with the same value, but it does not consider the case when the elements are alternating.

The program should be modified to handle this case. One possible solution is to keep track of the minimum length of consecutive elements with the same value, and also keep track of the number of times the elements alternate. The minimum number of elements to remove should be the minimum of these two values.
