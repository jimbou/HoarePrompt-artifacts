Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, ar is a list of integers, same is 1, num is the first element of ar, minn is positive infinity, i is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0**

The code first reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, which is now an integer greater than 0. The second line reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `ar`. Since `input()` is an integer and is greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers. The third line assigns 1 to `same`. The fourth line assigns the first element of `ar` to `num`. The fifth line assigns positive infinity to `minn`. The sixth line assigns 1 to `i`. The seventh line does not affect any variables. Stdin now contains t-1 test cases. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0.
