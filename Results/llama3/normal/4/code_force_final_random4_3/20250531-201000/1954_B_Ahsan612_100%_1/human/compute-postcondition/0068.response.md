Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least i+1 elements, `same` is either 1, 2, or 3, `num` is either the first element of `ar`, the element of `ar` at index `i`, or the element of `ar` at index `i+2`, `minn` is either 1 or infinity, `i` is either 2, 3, or `i+2`, stdin contains t-5 test cases, and _ is 2. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, `same` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the element of `ar` at index `i`, and `minn` is either 1 or its original value if it was less than 1.***
