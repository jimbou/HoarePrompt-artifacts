Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least `i+4` elements, `same` is either 2, 3, or 4, `num` is either the first element of `ar`, the element of `ar` at index `i`, or the element of `ar` at index `i+2`, `minn` is either 1 or infinity, `i` is either 3, 4, or `i+3`, stdin contains t-5 test cases, and _ is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `same` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be 2, 3, or 4. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `ar` still has at least `i+4` elements, and `num` is still either the first element of `ar`, the element at index `i`, or the element at index `i+2`. The value of `minn` is still either 1 or infinity, and `i` is still either 3, 4, or `i+3`. There are still t-5 test cases in stdin, and the value of `_` is still 2.
