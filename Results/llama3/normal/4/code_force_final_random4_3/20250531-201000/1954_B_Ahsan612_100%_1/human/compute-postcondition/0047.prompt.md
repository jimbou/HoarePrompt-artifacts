Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, ar is a list of integers, same is 1, num is the first element of ar, minn is infinity, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, _ is 1
Code of the loop:
while i < len(ar):
    if ar[i] == num:
        same += 1
    else:
        i += 1
        num = ar[i]
        minn = min(minn, same)
        same = 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `ar` has at least 2 elements, `same` is either 1 or 2, `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the element at index `i+2` of `ar`, `minn` is either infinity or 1, `i` is either 2 or `i+2`, stdin contains t-3 test cases, and _ is 1. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is updated to the element at index `i+2` of `ar`, `minn` is updated to 1, and `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer, `ar` has at least 3 elements, `minn` is either infinity or 1, `i` is either 3 or `i+3` or 2 or `i+2` and is less than len(ar), stdin contains t-3 test cases, and _ is 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 2 or 3, and `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the element at index `i+2` of `ar`. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the element at index `i+1` of `ar`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer, `ar` has at least 3 elements, `minn` is either infinity or 1 or 2 or 3, `i` is either 4 or `i+3` or 3 or `i+2` or 5 or `i+4` and is less than `len(ar)-1`, stdin contains t-3 test cases, and _ is 1. If `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 3 or 4, and `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the element at index `i+1` of `ar`. Otherwise, if `ar[i-1]` is not equal to `num`, then either `same` is 2 and `num` is the element at index `i` of `ar`, or `same` is 1 and `num` is the element at index `i-1` of `ar`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
