Output State: **n is an integer, ar has at least 3 elements, minn is either infinity or 1 or 2 or 3, i is either 4 or i+4 or 3 or i+3 and is less than len(ar)-1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, _ is 1, num is the element at index i of ar, and same is 1.**

The code increments the value of `i` by 1, making it either 4 or `i+4` or 3 or `i+3`, still less than `len(ar)-1`. Then, it assigns the value of the element at the new index `i` of `ar` to `num`. The value of `minn` is updated to be the minimum between its original value (either infinity or 1) and the value of `same` (either 2 or 3). Finally, the value of `same` is reset to 1. The values of `n`, `ar`, stdin, and `_` remain unchanged.
