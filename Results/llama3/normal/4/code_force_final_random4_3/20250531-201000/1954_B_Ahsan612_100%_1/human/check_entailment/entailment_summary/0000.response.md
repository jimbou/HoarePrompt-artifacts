Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the array to make it not beautiful. The program iterates through the array, keeping track of the length of the current sequence of equal elements. It updates the minimum length of such sequences as it iterates. If the minimum length is equal to the length of the array or if the array contains only one unique element, it prints -1, indicating that it's impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements. Otherwise, it prints the minimum length.

Correctness: **True**
