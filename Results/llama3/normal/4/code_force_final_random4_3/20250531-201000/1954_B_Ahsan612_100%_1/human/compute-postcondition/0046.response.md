Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` has at least 3 elements, `minn` is either infinity or 1 or 2 or 3, `i` is either 4 or `i+3` or 3 or `i+2` or 5 or `i+4` and is less than `len(ar)-1`, stdin contains t-3 test cases, and _ is 1. If `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 3 or 4, and `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the element at index `i+1` of `ar`. Otherwise, if `ar[i-1]` is not equal to `num`, then either `same` is 2 and `num` is the element at index `i` of `ar`, or `same` is 1 and `num` is the element at index `i-1` of `ar`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `same` and `num` are updated to reflect the new value of `i`.
