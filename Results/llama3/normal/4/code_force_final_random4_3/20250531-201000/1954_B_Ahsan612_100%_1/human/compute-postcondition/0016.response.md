Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, ar is a list of integers with more than 5 elements, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0, same is 1, num is the i-th element of ar, minn is either positive infinity, 1, or its original value if it was less than 1, and i is either 4, 5, or 6. If ar[i-1] is equal to num, then same is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, same is 1, num is either the fourth or fifth element of ar, and minn is either 1 or its original value if it was less than 1.**

The code increments the value of `i` by 1, making it either 4, 5, or 6. Then, it assigns the `i-th` element of `ar` to `num`, which is either the fourth or fifth element of `ar`. The value of `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and `same`, which is either positive infinity, 1, or its original value if it was less than 1. Finally, the value of `same` is reset to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
