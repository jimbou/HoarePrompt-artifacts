Based on the initial state, the print statement will print the value of `minn`.

`minn` is the minimum of the length of the shortest sequence of equal elements in `ar` and `same`. Since `same` is either 1 or the length of the longest sequence of equal elements in `ar`, `minn` will be the minimum of the length of the shortest sequence of equal elements in `ar` and 1 (if `same` is 1) or the length of the longest sequence of equal elements in `ar` (if `same` is not 1).

Since `minn` is not equal to `inf` and `minn` is not equal to `len(ar)`, it means that `minn` is a finite value and it is not equal to the length of the entire array `ar`.

Therefore, the print statement will print the minimum length of the shortest sequence of equal elements in `ar`, which is a finite value.

Output: **the minimum length of the shortest sequence of equal elements in ar**
