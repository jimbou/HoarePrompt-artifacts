Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` has at least 3 elements, `minn` is either infinity or 1, `i` is either 3 or `i+3` or 2 or `i+2` and is less than len(ar), stdin contains t-3 test cases, and _ is 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 2 or 3, and `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the element at index `i+2` of `ar`. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the element at index `i+1` of `ar`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `same`, `num`, and `i` are still dependent on whether `ar[i]` is equal to `num`. The stdin still contains t-3 test cases, and the value of `_` remains 1.
