Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `same` is 2, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, and _ is 2. The current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `same` being 2. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships. The stdin still contains t-5 test cases, and the current value of `ar[i]` remains equal to `num`.
