Output State: **n is an integer, ar is a list of integers with at least i+4 elements, same is 1, num is the element of ar at index i, minn is either 1 or the minimum of its original value and 1, i is either 4, 5, or i+4, stdin contains t-5 test cases, and _ is 2.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

After executing the code, the value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it either 4, 5, or `i+4`. The value of `num` is updated to be the element of `ar` at the new index `i`. The value of `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and 1, which means it can either remain the same or become 1. The value of `same` is reset to 1. All other variables, including `n`, `ar`, `stdin`, and `_`, remain unchanged.
