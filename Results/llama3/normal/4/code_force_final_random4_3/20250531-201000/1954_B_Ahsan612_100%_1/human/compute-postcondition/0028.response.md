The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `stdin`. If `_` is less than the integer read from `stdin`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 and `stdin` must contain `t-2` test cases.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is 1, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `_` is 1**
