Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The program iterates through the array, keeping track of the length of the longest sequence of equal elements. It also keeps track of the minimum length of such sequences. If the minimum length is infinity or equal to the length of the array, it means that all elements in the array are the same, and it is impossible to make the array stop being beautiful by removing elements. In this case, the program prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the minimum length of the sequence of equal elements.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It iterates through the array, updates the minimum length of the sequence of equal elements, and prints the correct result based on the minimum length.

Correctness: **True**
