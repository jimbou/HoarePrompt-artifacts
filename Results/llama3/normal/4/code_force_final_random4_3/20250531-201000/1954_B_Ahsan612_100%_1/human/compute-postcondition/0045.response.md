Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `ar` has at least 3 elements, `minn` is either infinity or 1 or 2 or 3, `i` is either 3 or `i+3` or 2 or `i+2` or 4 or `i+4` and is less than `len(ar)-1`, stdin contains t-3 test cases, and _ is 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 3 or 4, and `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the element at index `i+2` of `ar`. Otherwise, if `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then either `same` is 2 and `num` is the element at index `i+1` of `ar`, or `same` is 1 and `num` is the element at index `i` of `ar`.***
