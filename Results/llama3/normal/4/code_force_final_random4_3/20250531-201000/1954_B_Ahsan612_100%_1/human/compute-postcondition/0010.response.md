Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `same` is either 2 or 3, `num` is either the first or second element of `ar`, `minn` is either positive infinity or 1, and `i` is either 2 or 3.**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 2 or 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
