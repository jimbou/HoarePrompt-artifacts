Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is 1, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and 1, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0. The current value of `minn` is either infinity or equal to the length of `ar`.**
