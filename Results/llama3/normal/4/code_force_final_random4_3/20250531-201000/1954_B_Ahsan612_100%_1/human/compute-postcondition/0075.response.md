Output State: **n is an integer, ar is a list of integers, same is either 1 or the length of the longest sequence of equal elements in ar, num is the last element of ar, minn is the length of the shortest sequence of equal elements in ar, i is equal to the length of ar, stdin contains t-5 test cases, and _ is 2.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer.
*   The list `ar` remains unchanged.
*   The variable `same` will be either 1 or the length of the longest sequence of equal elements in the list `ar`.
*   The variable `num` will be the last element of the list `ar`.
*   The variable `minn` will be the length of the shortest sequence of equal elements in the list `ar`.
*   The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `ar`.
*   The value of `stdin` remains unchanged, containing t-5 test cases.
*   The value of `_` remains unchanged, equal to 2.
