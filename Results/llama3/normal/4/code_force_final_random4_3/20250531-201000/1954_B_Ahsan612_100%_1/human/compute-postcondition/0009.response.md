To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition, which is `i < len(ar)`. This means we need to consider the values of `i` and `len(ar)`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `n` is an integer greater than 0
- `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements
- `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases
- `_` is 0
- If the second element of `ar` is equal to the first element, then `same` is 2, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `minn` is positive infinity, and `i` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the second element of `ar`, `minn` is 1, and `i` is 3.

To adjust the state so that the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `len(ar)`. Since `i` can be either 2 or 3 depending on the condition, we need to adjust `len(ar)` to be greater than the maximum possible value of `i`, which is 3.

Therefore, the state adjustment is focused on ensuring `len(ar)` is at least 4, so that regardless of whether `i` is 2 or 3, the loop condition `i < len(ar)` is satisfied.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `same` is either 1 or 2, `num` is either the first or second element of `ar`, `minn` is either positive infinity or 1, and `i` is either 2 or 3.**
