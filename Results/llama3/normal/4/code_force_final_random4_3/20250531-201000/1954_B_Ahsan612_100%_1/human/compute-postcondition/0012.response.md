Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `same` is either 1, 2, or 3, `num` is one of the first four elements of `ar`, `minn` is either positive infinity, 1, or its original value if it was less than 1, and `i` is either 2, 3, or 4. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is either the third or fourth element of `ar`, and `minn` is either 1 or its original value if it was less than 1.***
