To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the loop condition: `i < len(ar)`. This means we need to consider the states of `i` and `ar` since these are the variables involved in the loop condition.

1. **State of `i`:** Before the loop, `i` is 1. This state does not need adjustment since any positive value of `i` could potentially satisfy the loop condition depending on the length of `ar`.

2. **State of `ar`:** Before the loop, `ar` is a list of integers. For the loop to execute at least once, `ar` must have at least one element more than the current value of `i`. Since `i` is 1, `ar` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the state that needs adjustment is the length of `ar`. It must be at least 2 for the loop to proceed.

State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `same` is 1, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, and _ is 2**
