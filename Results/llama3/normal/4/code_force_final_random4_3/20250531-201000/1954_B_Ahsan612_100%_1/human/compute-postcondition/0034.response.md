Output State: **n is an integer, ar has at least 2 elements, same is 1, num is the element at index i+1 of ar, minn is 1, i is i+1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, _ is 1**

The code block increments the value of `i` by 1, updates `num` to be the element at the new index `i` in array `ar`, sets `minn` to be the minimum between its current value (infinity) and `same` (1), and resets `same` to 1. The values of `n`, `ar`, `stdin`, and `_` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
