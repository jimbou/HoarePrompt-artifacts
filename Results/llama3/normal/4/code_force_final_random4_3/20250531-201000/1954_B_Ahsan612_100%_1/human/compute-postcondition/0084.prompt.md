Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
    same = 1
    num = ar[0]
    minn = inf
    i = 1
    while i < len(ar):
        if ar[i] == num:
            same += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            num = ar[i]
            minn = min(minn, same)
            same = 1
        i += 1
    minn = min(minn, same)
    if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(minn)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is 1, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0. If `minn` is either infinity or equal to the length of `ar`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum value between 1 and the previous value of `minn` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer, ar has at least 1 element, same is either 1 or the length of the longest sequence of equal elements in ar, num is the last element of ar, minn is the minimum of the length of the shortest sequence of equal elements in ar and same, i is equal to len(ar), stdin contains t-3 test cases, and _ is 1. If minn is either infinity or equal to the length of ar, -1 is printed. Otherwise, minn is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is either 1 or the length of the longest sequence of equal elements in `ar`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, stdin contains t-5 test cases, and `_` is 2. If the minimum of the length of the shortest sequence of equal elements in `ar` and `same` is either infinity or equal to the length of `ar`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum of the length of the shortest sequence of equal elements in `ar` and `same` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
