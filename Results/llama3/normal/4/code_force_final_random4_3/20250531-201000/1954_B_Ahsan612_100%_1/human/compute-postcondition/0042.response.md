According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `ar`. If `i` is less than `len(ar)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 3 or `i+3` or 2 or `i+2` and is less than `len(ar)`, and `ar` has at least 3 elements. `i` being less than `len(ar)` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than `len(ar)-1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` has at least 3 elements, `minn` is either infinity or 1, `i` is either 3 or `i+3` or 2 or `i+2` and is less than `len(ar)-1`, stdin contains t-3 test cases, and _ is 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 2 or 3, and `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the element at index `i+2` of `ar`. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the element at index `i+1` of `ar`.**
