Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 0, ar is a list of integers, same is 1, num is the first element of ar, minn is positive infinity, i is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0
Code of the loop:
while i < len(ar):
    if ar[i] == num:
        same += 1
    else:
        i += 1
        num = ar[i]
        minn = min(minn, same)
        same = 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0. If the second element of `ar` is equal to the first element, then `same` is 2, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `minn` is positive infinity, and `i` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the second element of `ar`, `minn` is 1, and `i` is 3.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `same` is either 1, 2, or 3, `num` is one of the first four elements of `ar`, `minn` is either positive infinity, 1, or its original value if it was less than 1, and `i` is either 3, 4, or 5. If `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is either the third or fourth element of `ar`, and `minn` is either 1 or its original value if it was less than 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers with more than 5 elements, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `minn` is either positive infinity, 1, or its original value if it was less than 1, `i` is either 4, 5, 6, or 7, `num` is either the third, fourth, or fifth element of `ar`, and if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, `same` is 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
