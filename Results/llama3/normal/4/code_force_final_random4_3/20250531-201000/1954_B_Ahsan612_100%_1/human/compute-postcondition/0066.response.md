Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least i+1 elements, `same` is either 2 or 3, `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the element of `ar` at index `i+2`, `minn` is either infinity or 1, `i` is either 2 or `i+2`, stdin contains t-5 test cases, and _ is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `same` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 2 or 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `ar` still has at least `i+1` elements, and `num` is still either the first element of `ar` or the element at index `i+2`. The value of `minn` is still either infinity or 1, and `i` is still either 2 or `i+2`. There are still `t-5` test cases in the standard input, and the value of `_` is still 2.
