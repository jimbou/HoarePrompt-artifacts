Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `ar` has at least 2 elements, `same` is either 1 or 2, `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the element at index `i+1` of `ar`, `minn` is either infinity or 1, `i` is either 1 or `i+1`, stdin contains t-3 test cases, and _ is 1. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is updated to the element at index `i+1` of `ar`, `minn` is updated to 1, and `i` is incremented by 1.***
