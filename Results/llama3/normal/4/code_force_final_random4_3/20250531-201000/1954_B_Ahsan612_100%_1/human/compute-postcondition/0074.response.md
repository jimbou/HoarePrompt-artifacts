Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least `i+3` elements, `same` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4, `num` is either the first element of `ar`, the element of `ar` at index `i-1`, or the element of `ar` at index `i+1`, `minn` is either 1 or infinity, `i` is either 4, 5, 6, or `i+2` or `i+3`, stdin contains t-5 test cases, and _ is 2. If `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, `same` is either 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the element of `ar` at index `i-1`, and `minn` is either 1 or the minimum of its original value and 1.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the conditions related to `same`, `num`, and `minn` have been updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.
