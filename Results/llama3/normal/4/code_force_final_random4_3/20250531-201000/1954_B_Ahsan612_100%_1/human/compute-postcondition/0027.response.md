Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is 1, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0. If `minn` is either infinity or equal to the length of `ar`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum value between 1 and the previous value of `minn` is printed.***
