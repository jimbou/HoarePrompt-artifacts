The code prints the sum of the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of `a` and `b`. If `temp` is -1, it prints the sum of the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of `a` and `b`. If `temp` is not -1, it prints the sum of the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of `a` and `b` and the sum of the absolute differences between `a[i - (n - temp - 1)]` and `b[-(n - (i - (n - temp - 1)))]` and ... and the absolute difference between `a[i - 1]` and `b[-(n - (i - 1))]` and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`.

Output: **sum of absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of `a` and `b` and the sum of absolute differences between `a[i - (n - temp - 1)]` and `b[-(n - (i - (n - temp - 1)))]` and ... and the absolute difference between `a[i - 1]` and `b[-(n - (i - 1))]` and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` (where `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is equal to `n`, `temp` is either -1 or not -1)**
