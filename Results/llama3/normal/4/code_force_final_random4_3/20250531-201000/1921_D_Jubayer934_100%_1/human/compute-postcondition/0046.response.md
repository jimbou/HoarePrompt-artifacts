The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, temp and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `temp` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, `temp` is less than `n` and `n` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `n` so `i` is `n-1` and `temp` is less than `n-1` and `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `temp` is less than `n-1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` up to the point where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` and also contains the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`**
