Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `temp` is set to 0 and `ans` remains an empty list. Otherwise, no changes are made to `temp` and `ans`.***
