Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` where the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is not greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and also contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for all `i` from `temp` to `n-1`, `temp` is equal to `n`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

*   The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `_`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
*   The value of `i` is now `n`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements in the range from `temp` to `n-1`.
*   The list `ans` now contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` where the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is not greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Additionally, it contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for all `i` from `temp` to `n-1`.
*   The value of `temp` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
