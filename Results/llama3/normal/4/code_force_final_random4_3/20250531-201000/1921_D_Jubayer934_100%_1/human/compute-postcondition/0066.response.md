Output State: **n is greater than 2, m is an integer greater than 0, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs, i is 2, ans is a list containing the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b and the absolute difference between the second elements of a and b, temp is 2.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `temp`, making `temp` equal to 2. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. No other variables are affected by the code.
