To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `temp`, and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `temp` and `n`. If `temp` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is equal to `n`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is equal to `temp`. Also, `temp` is in the range [0, n - 1], which ensures that `temp` is less than `n`. Therefore, the adjusted states are:

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs, `i` is equal to `temp`, `temp` is an integer in the range [0, n - 1] and less than `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of `a` and `b`**
