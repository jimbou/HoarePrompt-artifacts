Output State: **`_` is equal to the number of test cases, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of `a` and `b` if `temp` is -1, or a list containing the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of `a` and `b` and the absolute differences between `a[i - (n - temp - 1)]` and `b[-(n - (i - (n - temp - 1)))]` and ... and the absolute difference between `a[i - 1]` and `b[-(n - (i - 1))]` and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` if `temp` is not -1, and the sum of the absolute differences is printed for each test case.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the loop counter `_` will be equal to the number of test cases, the standard input `stdin` will be empty because all test cases have been processed, the loop variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop iterates `n` times, and the list `ans` will contain the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `b` as calculated by the loop. If `temp` is -1, `ans` will contain the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of `a` and `b`. If `temp` is not -1, `ans` will contain the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of `a` and `b` and the absolute differences between `a[i - (n - temp - 1)]` and `b[-(n - (i - (n - temp - 1)))]` and ... and the absolute difference between `a[i - 1]` and `b[-(n - (i - 1))]` and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`. The sum of the absolute differences in `ans` will be printed for each test case.
