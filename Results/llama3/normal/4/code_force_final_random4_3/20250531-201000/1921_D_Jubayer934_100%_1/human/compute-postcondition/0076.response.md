Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `temp + 2`, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs, `i` is equal to `temp + 2`, `temp` is an integer in the range [0, n - 1] and less than `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of `a` and `b` and the absolute differences between `a[i - 2]` and `b[-(n - (i - 2))]` and the absolute difference between `a[i - 1]` and `b[-(n - (i - 1))]` and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that the list `ans` now contains an additional element, which is the absolute difference between the `i-th` element of `a` and the `(n-i)-th` element of `b`.
