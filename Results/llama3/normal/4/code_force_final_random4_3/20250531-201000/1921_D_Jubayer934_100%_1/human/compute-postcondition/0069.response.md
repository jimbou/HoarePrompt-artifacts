Output State: **n is greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer greater than 0, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs, i is equal to n, temp is either -1 or an integer in the range [0, n - 1], ans is a list containing the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of a and b.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same values for n, m, a, b, _, and stdin as in the initial state. The variable i will be equal to n, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The variable temp will either remain -1 (if the condition in the loop was never true) or will be an integer in the range [0, n - 1] (if the condition was true at some point during the loop execution). The variable ans will contain the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of a and b.
