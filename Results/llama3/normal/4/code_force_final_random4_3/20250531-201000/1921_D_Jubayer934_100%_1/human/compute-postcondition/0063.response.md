Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between the first elements of `a` and `b`. If `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, then `temp` is 1. Otherwise, `temp` is -1.**
