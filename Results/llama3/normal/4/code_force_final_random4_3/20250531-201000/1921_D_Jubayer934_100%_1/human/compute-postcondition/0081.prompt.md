Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The third line contains m integers b_i (1 <= b_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    temp = -1
    ans = []
    a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]
    b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]
    for i in range(n):
        if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
            temp = i
            break
        ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))
    if temp != -1:
        for i in range(temp, n):
            ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))
    print(sum(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` where the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is not greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `temp` is not equal to -1, `ans` also contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for all `i` from `temp` to `n-1`, and `temp` is equal to `n`, and the sum of the absolute differences in the list `ans` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `i` is equal to `n`. If `temp` is not equal to -1, then `temp` is equal to `n` and `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` up to the point where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` and also contains the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for all `i` from `temp` to `n`. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) <= abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i`, and the sum of the absolute differences in `ans` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs, `i` is equal to `n`, if `temp` is -1, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of `a` and `b`. If `temp` is not -1, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of `a` and `b` and the absolute differences between `a[i - (n - temp - 1)]` and `b[-(n - (i - (n - temp - 1)))]` and ... and the absolute difference between `a[i - 1]` and `b[-(n - (i - 1))]` and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`, and the sum of the absolute differences is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
