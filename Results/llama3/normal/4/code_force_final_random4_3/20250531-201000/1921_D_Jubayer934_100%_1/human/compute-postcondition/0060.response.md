The code appends the absolute difference between the current elements of lists `a` and `b` to the list `ans`. The current elements are `a[i]` and `b[i]`. The value of `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs, `i` is 0, if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, then `temp` is 0, otherwise, `temp` is -1, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between the first elements of `a` and `b`**
