Postcondition: **n is greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer greater than 0, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs, i is equal to n, temp is an integer in the range [0, n - 1], ans is a list containing the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of a and b. The current value of temp is not -1.**
