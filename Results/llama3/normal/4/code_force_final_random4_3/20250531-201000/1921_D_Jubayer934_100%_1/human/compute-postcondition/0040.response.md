Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, m is an integer greater than 0, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, i is less than n and i is increased by 1, ans is a list containing the absolute difference between the current element of a and the current element of b and the absolute difference between the current element of a and the current element of b appended to it. If abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]), then temp is equal to the current value of i. Otherwise, temp remains -1.***
