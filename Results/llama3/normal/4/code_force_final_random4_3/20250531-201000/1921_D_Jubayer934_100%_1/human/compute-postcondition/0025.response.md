The code prints the sum of the absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` that meet the given conditions.
Since `temp` is equal to `n`, the `ans` list contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` where the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is not greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. 
Output: **sum of absolute differences between elements of a and b that meet the given conditions**
