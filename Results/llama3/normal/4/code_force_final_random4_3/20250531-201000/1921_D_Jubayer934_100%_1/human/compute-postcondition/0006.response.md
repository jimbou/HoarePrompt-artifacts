Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `temp` is set to 0.**

In this output state, the code has appended the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `_`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `temp` is set to 0 if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
