To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the state of the variable `i` and `n` because they are the only variables in the loop head.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` is greater than 1, it must also be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]` and the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `b[1]`. If the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `b[-(n - 1)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `b[1]`, then `temp` is set to 1. Otherwise, `temp` remains unchanged.**
