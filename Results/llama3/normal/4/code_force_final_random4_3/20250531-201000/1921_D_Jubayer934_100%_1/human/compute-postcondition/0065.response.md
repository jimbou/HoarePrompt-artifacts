The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between the first elements of `a` and `b` and the absolute difference between the second elements of `a` and `b`. If `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, then `temp` is 1. Otherwise, `temp` is -1.**
