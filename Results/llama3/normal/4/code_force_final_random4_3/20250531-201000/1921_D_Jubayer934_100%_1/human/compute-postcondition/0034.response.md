The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i` after the increment.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `i` is less than `n` and `i` is increased by 1, if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, then `temp` is equal to the current value of `i`. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1. `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between the current element of `a` and the current element of `b`.**
