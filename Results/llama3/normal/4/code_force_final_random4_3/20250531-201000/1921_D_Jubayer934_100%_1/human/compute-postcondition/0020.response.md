Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is `temp + 1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` where the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is not greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and also contains the absolute difference between `a[temp]` and `b[-(n - temp)]` and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`, `temp` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than `temp`**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `ans` now contains an additional element, which is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`. This means that the code has appended a new element to the list `ans`, but has not changed the values of any other variables.
