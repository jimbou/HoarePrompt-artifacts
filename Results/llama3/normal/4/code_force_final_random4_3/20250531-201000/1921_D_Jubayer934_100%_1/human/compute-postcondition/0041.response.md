Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `i` is less than `n` and `i` is increased by 1, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between the current element of `a` and the current element of `b` and the absolute difference between the current element of `a` and the current element of `b` appended to it and the absolute difference between the current element of `a` and the current element of `b` appended to it, If abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]), then `temp` is equal to the current value of `i`. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated by appending the absolute difference between the current element of `a` and the current element of `b`. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `_`, and `temp` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still less than `n` and has been increased by 1. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.
