Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `temp` is -1, `ans` is an empty list, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0. The current value of `i` is 0. The absolute difference between the `i-th` element of `a` and the `n-i-th` element of `b` is greater than the absolute difference between the `i-th` element of `a` and the `i-th` element of `b`.**
