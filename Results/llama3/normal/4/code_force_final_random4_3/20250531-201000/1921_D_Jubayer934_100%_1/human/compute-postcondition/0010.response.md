Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]` and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `temp` is set to 1. Otherwise, `temp` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the list `ans` has been updated to include the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, in addition to the initial absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
