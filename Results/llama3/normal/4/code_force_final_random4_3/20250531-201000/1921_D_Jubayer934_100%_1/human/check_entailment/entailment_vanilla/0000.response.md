Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by rearranging the elements of array b to make it as different as possible from array a.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by sorting both arrays and then comparing the absolute differences between corresponding elements. If the difference between an element in a and the corresponding element in b is greater than the difference between the element in a and the corresponding element in the reversed b, it swaps the elements.

However, this approach is incorrect because it only checks for a single swap and does not consider all possible swaps. The correct approach would be to try all possible swaps and choose the one that results in the maximum total difference.

Moreover, the program only considers the first n elements of the sorted array b, which may not be the optimal choice. The correct approach would be to consider all elements of b and choose the n elements that result in the maximum total difference.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
