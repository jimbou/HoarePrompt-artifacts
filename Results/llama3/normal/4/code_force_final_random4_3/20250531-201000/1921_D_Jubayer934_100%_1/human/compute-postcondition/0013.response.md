Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 2, m is an integer greater than 0, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is 2, ans is a list containing the absolute difference between a[0] and b[0] and the absolute difference between a[1] and b[1]. If the absolute difference between a[2] and b[-(n - 2)] is greater than the absolute difference between a[2] and b[2], then temp is set to 2. Otherwise, temp remains unchanged.***
