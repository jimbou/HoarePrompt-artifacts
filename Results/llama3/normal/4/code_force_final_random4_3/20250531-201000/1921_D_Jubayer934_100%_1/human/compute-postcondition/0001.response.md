Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer greater than 0, temp is -1, ans is an empty list, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

The first line assigns the values of two integers from stdin to `n` and `m`. Since `input()` must be greater than 0, both `n` and `m` are positive integers. The second line assigns -1 to `temp`. The third line initializes an empty list `ans`. The fourth line assigns a sorted list of `n` integers from stdin to `a`. The fifth line assigns a sorted list of `m` integers from stdin in descending order to `b`. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
