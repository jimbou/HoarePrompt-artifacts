Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs, `i` is 0, `temp` is -1, `ans` is an empty list. The current value of `i` is 0 and the absolute difference between the `i-th` element of `a` and the `i-th` element of `b` is greater than the absolute difference between the `i-th` element of `a` and the `(n-i-1)-th` element of `b`.**
