Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs, `i` is 0, if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, then `temp` is 0, otherwise, `temp` is -1, `ans` is an empty list.**
