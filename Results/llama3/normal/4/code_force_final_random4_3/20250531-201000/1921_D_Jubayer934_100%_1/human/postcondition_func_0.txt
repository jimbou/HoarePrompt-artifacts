This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: two integers n and m, followed by n integers a_i and m integers b_i. It calculates the sum of absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of a_i and b_i, and if a certain condition is met, it also calculates the sum of absolute differences between the remaining elements of a_i and the corresponding elements of b_i in reverse order. The function prints the sum of these absolute differences for each test case, and after processing all test cases, the standard input is empty.
