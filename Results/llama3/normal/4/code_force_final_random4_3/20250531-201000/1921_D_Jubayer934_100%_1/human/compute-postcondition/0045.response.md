Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `i` is equal to `n`, `temp` is less than `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` up to the point where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` and also contains the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
