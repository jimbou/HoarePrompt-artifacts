The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `temp` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n` and `temp` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`, `temp` is less than `n-1` and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` is `n` and `temp` is `n-1` and `n` is greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `i` is equal to `n`, `temp` is `n-1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` up to the point where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` and also contains the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]**
