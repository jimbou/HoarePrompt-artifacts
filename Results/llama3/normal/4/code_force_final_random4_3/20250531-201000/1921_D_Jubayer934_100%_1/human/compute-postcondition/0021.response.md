The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `temp + 1`, `n` is greater than `temp`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i`. Therefore, `i` is `temp + 2` and `n` is greater than `temp + 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is `temp + 2`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` where the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is not greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and also contains the absolute difference between `a[temp]` and `b[-(n - temp)]` and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`, `temp` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than `temp + 1`**
