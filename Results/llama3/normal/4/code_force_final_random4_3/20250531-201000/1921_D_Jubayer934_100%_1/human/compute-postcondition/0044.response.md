To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i`, `temp`, and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `temp` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `temp` must be less than `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `i` is equal to `n`, `temp` is less than `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` up to the point where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`**
