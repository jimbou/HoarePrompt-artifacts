Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer greater than 0, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, i is n, temp is -1, ans is an empty list**

The code block reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `m`, respectively. It then initializes `temp` to -1 and `ans` to an empty list. The next two lines read a sorted list of `n` integers and a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order from stdin, and assign them to `a` and `b`, respectively. The `sorted` function is used to ensure that the lists are sorted in ascending and descending order, respectively. The `[:n]` and `[:m]` slicing operations are used to limit the length of the lists to `n` and `m`, respectively. The `map` function is used to convert the input strings to integers. The `input` function is used to read input from stdin. The `split` function is used to split the input string into a list of strings, which are then converted to integers using the `map` function.
