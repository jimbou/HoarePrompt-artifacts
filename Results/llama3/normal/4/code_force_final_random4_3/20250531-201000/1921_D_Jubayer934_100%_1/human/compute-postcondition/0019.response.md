To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(temp, n):`. The objects involved are `i`, `temp`, and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `temp`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

The state of `temp` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The state of `n` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is `temp + 1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` where the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is not greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and also contains the absolute difference between `a[temp]` and `b[-(n - temp)]`, `temp` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than `temp`**
