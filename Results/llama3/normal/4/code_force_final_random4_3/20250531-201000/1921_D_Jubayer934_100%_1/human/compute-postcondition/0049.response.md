Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `i` is equal to `n`, `temp` is `n-1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` up to the point where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` and also contains the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` and the absolute difference between `a[n]` and `b[-(n - n)]`**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `ans` now contains an additional element, which is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the first element of `b`.
