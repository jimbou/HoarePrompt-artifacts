The code prints the sum of the absolute differences between elements of lists `a` and `b`, where the differences are calculated based on a specific condition.

If `temp` is not equal to -1, then `temp` is equal to `n`, and the sum includes the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` up to the point where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, as well as the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for all `i` from `temp` to `n`.

Otherwise, the sum includes the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) <= abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i`.

Output: **the sum of the absolute differences between elements of lists a and b, calculated based on the condition described in the precondition**
