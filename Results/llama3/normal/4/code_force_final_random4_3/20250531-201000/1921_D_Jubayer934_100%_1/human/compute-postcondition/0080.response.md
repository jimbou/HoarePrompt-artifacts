The code prints the sum of the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of `a` and `b`, and if `temp` is not -1, the sum also includes the absolute differences between `a[i - (n - temp - 1)]` and `b[-(n - (i - (n - temp - 1)))]` and ... and the absolute difference between `a[i - 1]` and `b[-(n - (i - 1))]` and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`. Where `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, and `temp` is either -1 or not -1.
Output: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs, `i` is equal to `n`, if `temp` is -1, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of `a` and `b`. If `temp` is not -1, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of `a` and `b` and the absolute differences between `a[i - (n - temp - 1)]` and `b[-(n - (i - (n - temp - 1)))]` and ... and the absolute difference between `a[i - 1]` and `b[-(n - (i - 1))]` and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`, and the sum of the absolute differences is printed**
