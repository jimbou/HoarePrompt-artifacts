Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs, `i` is equal to `n`, `temp` is an integer in the range [0, n - 1] and less than `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of `a` and `b` and the absolute differences between `a[i - (n - temp - 1)]` and `b[-(n - (i - (n - temp - 1)))]` and ... and the absolute difference between `a[i - 1]` and `b[-(n - (i - 1))]` and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same properties as the initial state, except that `i` will be equal to `n`, and `ans` will contain the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of `a` and `b`, as well as the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `b` from index `temp` to `n-1`.
