Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer greater than 0, temp is -1, ans is an empty list, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
        temp = i
        break
    ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `temp` is set to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]` and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `temp` is set to 1. Otherwise, `temp` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `b[1]`, and the absolute difference between `a[2]` and `b[2]`. If the absolute difference between `a[2]` and `b[-(n - 2)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[2]` and `b[2]`, then `temp` is set to 2. Otherwise, `temp` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
