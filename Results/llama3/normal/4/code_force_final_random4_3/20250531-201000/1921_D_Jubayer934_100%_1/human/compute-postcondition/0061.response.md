To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. In this case, the only variable in the loop head is `i`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs, `i` is 1, if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, then `temp` is 0, otherwise, `temp` is -1, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between the first elements of `a` and `b**
