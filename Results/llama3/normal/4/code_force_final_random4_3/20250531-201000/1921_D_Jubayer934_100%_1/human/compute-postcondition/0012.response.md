Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, m is an integer greater than 0, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is 2, ans is a list containing the absolute difference between a[0] and b[0] and the absolute difference between a[1] and b[1], temp is 2.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `temp`, making `temp` equal to 2. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, retaining their initial values and properties as described in the initial state.
