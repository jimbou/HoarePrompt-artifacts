Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, m is an integer greater than 0, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, i is less than n and i is increased by 1, ans is a list containing the absolute difference between the current element of a and the current element of b and the absolute difference between the current element of a and the current element of b appended to it, temp is equal to the current value of i.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the current value of `i` to `temp`. The second line breaks out of the loop. 

Since `i` is less than `n` and is increased by 1, its value is updated. The value of `temp` is also updated to the current value of `i`. No other variables are affected by the code snippet. 

The final state includes all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution, and the values of `i` and `temp` are updated according to the code.
