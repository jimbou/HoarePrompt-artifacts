The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `temp`, `temp` is an integer in the range [0, n - 1] and less than `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0. So for the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i`. 
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs, `i` is equal to `temp + 1`, `temp` is an integer in the range [0, n - 1] and less than `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of `a` and `b` and the absolute difference between `a[i - 1]` and `b[-(n - (i - 1))]`**
