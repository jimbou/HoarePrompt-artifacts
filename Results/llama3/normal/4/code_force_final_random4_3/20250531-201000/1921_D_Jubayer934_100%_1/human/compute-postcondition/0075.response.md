The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `temp + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `temp` is an integer in the range [0, n - 1] and less than `n`. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` is equal to `temp + 2` and `n` is greater than `temp + 1`. 
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `temp + 2`, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs, `i` is equal to `temp + 2`, `temp` is an integer in the range [0, n - 1] and less than `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of `a` and `b` and the absolute differences between `a[i - 2]` and `b[-(n - (i - 2))]` and the absolute difference between `a[i - 1]` and `b[-(n - (i - 1))]` and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`.**
