Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference D that Vasya can obtain by choosing n integers from the array b_i and arranging them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i of length n.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the values of n and m, followed by the arrays a_i and b_i. It sorts the arrays a_i and b_i in ascending and descending order respectively, and then calculates the sum of absolute differences between the first min(n, m) elements of a_i and b_i.

The program then checks if the absolute difference between the current element of a_i and the corresponding element of b_i in reverse order is greater than the absolute difference between the current element of a_i and the corresponding element of b_i. If this condition is met, it updates the sum of absolute differences by adding the absolute differences between the remaining elements of a_i and the corresponding elements of b_i in reverse order.

Finally, the program prints the sum of absolute differences for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
