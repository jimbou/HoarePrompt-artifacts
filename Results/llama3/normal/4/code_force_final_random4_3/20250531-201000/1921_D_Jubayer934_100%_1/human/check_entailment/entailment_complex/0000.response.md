Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `n` integers `a_i` and `m` integers `b_i`.

2. It sorts the arrays `a_i` and `b_i` in ascending and descending order, respectively, which is necessary to find the maximum total difference `D`.

3. The program then iterates over the first `n` elements of `a_i` and `b_i`. For each pair of elements, it calculates the absolute difference and appends it to the list `ans`.

4. If the absolute difference between the current element of `a_i` and the corresponding element of `b_i` is less than the absolute difference between the current element of `a_i` and the last element of `b_i`, the program breaks the loop and calculates the absolute differences between the remaining elements of `a_i` and the corresponding elements of `b_i` in reverse order.

5. Finally, the program prints the sum of the absolute differences for each test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
