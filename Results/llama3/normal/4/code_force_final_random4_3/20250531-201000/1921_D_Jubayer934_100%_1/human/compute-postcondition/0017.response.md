To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `temp`, and `n`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:


1. `i` is the loop variable, and its initial value is determined by `temp`. For the loop to execute, `i` should start from `temp`.
2. `temp` is the starting point of the loop, and its value affects whether the loop executes. Since `temp` is not -1, it means there exists an index `i` where the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This implies that `temp` is less than `n`, because if `temp` were equal to `n`, the loop would not execute.
3. `n` is the upper bound of the loop, and its value determines how many iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute, `n` should be greater than `temp`.

Considering these points, we can adjust the states as follows:


State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is `temp`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` where the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is not greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `temp` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than `temp`**
