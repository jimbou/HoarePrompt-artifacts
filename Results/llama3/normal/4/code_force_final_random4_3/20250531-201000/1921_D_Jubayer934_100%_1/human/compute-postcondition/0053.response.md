The code prints the sum of the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` up to the point where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` and also the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for all `i` from `temp` to `n` if `temp` is not equal to -1. Otherwise, it prints the sum of the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) <= abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i`.

Output: ** `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `i` is equal to `n`. If `temp` is not equal to -1, then `temp` is equal to `n` and `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` up to the point where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` and also contains the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for all `i` from `temp` to `n`. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) <= abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i`, and the sum of the absolute differences in `ans` is printed**
