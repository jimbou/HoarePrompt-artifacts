Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `i` is equal to `n`, `temp` is either -1 or the value of `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) <= abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i`, otherwise `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` up to the point where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `_`, and `stdin` as in the initial state. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has finished iterating over all elements of `a`. The variable `temp` will either remain -1 if the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` was never true, or it will hold the value of `i` where this condition was first met. The list `ans` will contain the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` if the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) <= abs(a[i] - b[i])` held true for all `i`, otherwise it will contain these differences up to the point where the condition was violated.
