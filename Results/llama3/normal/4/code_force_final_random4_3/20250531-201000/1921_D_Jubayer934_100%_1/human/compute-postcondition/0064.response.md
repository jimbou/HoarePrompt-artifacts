Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between the first elements of `a` and `b` and the absolute difference between the second elements of `a` and `b`. If `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, then `temp` is 1. Otherwise, `temp` is -1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `_`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 1. The list `ans` now contains two elements: the absolute difference between the first elements of `a` and `b`, and the absolute difference between the second elements of `a` and `b`. The value of `temp` is still dependent on the comparison between the absolute differences of the elements of `a` and `b`.
