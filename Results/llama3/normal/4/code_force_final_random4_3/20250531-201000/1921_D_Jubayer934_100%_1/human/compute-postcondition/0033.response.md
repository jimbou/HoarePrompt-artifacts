Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `i` is less than `n`, if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, then `temp` is equal to the current value of `i`. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1. `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between the current element of `a` and the current element of `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the value of `i` is still less than `n`. The value of `temp` is either the current value of `i` or -1, depending on the condition. The list `ans` now contains the absolute difference between the current elements of `a` and `b`. The other variables `_`, `n`, `m`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
