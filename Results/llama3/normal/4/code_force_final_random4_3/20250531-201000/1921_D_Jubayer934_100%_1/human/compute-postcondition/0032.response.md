Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `i` is less than `n`, if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, then `temp` is equal to the current value of `i`. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1. `ans` is an empty list.***
