Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the number of test cases is not 10. The program assumes that the number of test cases is always 10, but the problem description states that the number of test cases can be between 1 and 100. If the number of test cases is not 10, the program will either read too many or too few input lines, leading to incorrect results or an error.

For example, if the input is:

5
1 9
8 4
1 4
3 4
2 0

The program will read 5 input lines, but it will still try to access the 6th to 10th elements of the x and y lists, which do not exist, leading to an error.

To fix this, the program should use the value of t to determine the number of input lines to read, rather than hardcoding it to 10.
