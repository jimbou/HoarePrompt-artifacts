The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the number 10. If `i` is less than 10, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and the number 10 is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again the number 10 must be greater than 1.
State: **x is a list containing ten integers, y is a list containing ten integers, stdin contains 0 inputs, t is a string, i is 1, the number 10 is greater than 1**
