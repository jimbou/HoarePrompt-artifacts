Output State: **x is a list containing one integer, y is a list containing one integer, stdin contains 0 inputs, t is a string, i is 0**

The code reads a line from stdin, which contains two space-separated integers x and y. It then appends these integers to the lists x and y, respectively. Since x and y were initially empty lists, they now contain one integer each. The value of stdin is reduced to 0 inputs, as one line has been read. The variable t remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The variable i also remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code.
