Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is a list containing ten integers, y is a list containing ten integers, stdin contains 0 inputs, t is a string, i is 9
Code of the loop:
for i in range(10):
    if x[i] < y[i]:
        print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
    else:
        print(y[i], ' ', x[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *x is a list containing ten integers, y is a list containing ten integers, stdin contains 0 inputs, t is a string, i is 0, the number 10 is greater than 0. If the first element of x is less than the first element of y, the first elements of x and y are printed. Otherwise, the first elements of y and x are printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: x is a list containing ten integers, y is a list containing ten integers, stdin contains 0 inputs, t is a string, i is 1, the number 10 is greater than 1. If the 2nd element of the list x is less than the 2nd element of the list y, the 2nd elements of the lists x and y are printed. Otherwise, the 2nd elements of the lists y and x are printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is a list containing ten integers, `y` is a list containing ten integers, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `t` is a string, `i` is 2, the number 10 is greater than 2. If the 3rd element of the list `x` is less than the 3rd element of the list `y`, then the 3rd element of the list `x` and the 3rd element of the list `y` are printed. Otherwise, the 3rd element of the list `y` and the 3rd element of the list `x` are printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
