Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) â€” the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) and then t lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9).
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
        
    #State: x is a list containing ten integers, y is a list containing ten integers, stdin contains 0 inputs, t is a string, i is 9
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
        
    #State: x is a list containing ten integers, y is a list containing ten integers, stdin contains 0 inputs, t is a string, i is 9, the number 10 is greater than or equal to 10. The elements of the lists x and y have been printed in ascending order for all ten iterations.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers from standard input for ten iterations, stores them in separate lists, and then prints each pair of integers in ascending order. The function does not return any value but modifies the standard output by printing the sorted pairs. The function assumes that the input is well-formed and does not perform any error checking.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
