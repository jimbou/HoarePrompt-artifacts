Based on the initial state, the code will print the value of `y[i]` followed by a space and then the value of `x[i]`.

Since `i` is 0, `y[i]` refers to the first element of the list `y`, and `x[i]` refers to the first element of the list `x`.

The output will be the first element of the list `y`, followed by a space, and then the first element of the list `x`.

Output: **the first element of the list y, the first element of the list x**
