Reasoning:

1. The problem requires reading the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, reading two integers `x` and `y`.
2. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `input()`.
3. However, the program assumes that the number of test cases is always 10, which is not necessarily true. The problem statement specifies that `t` can be any integer between 1 and 100.
4. The program uses two separate lists `x` and `y` to store the input integers, which is not necessary. A single list of pairs or a list of tuples would be more efficient.
5. The program correctly splits the input string into two integers using `split(' ')` and converts them to integers using `int()`.
6. The program correctly compares the two integers and prints the minimum and maximum values in the correct order.
7. However, the program does not handle the case where `x` and `y` are equal. In this case, the program will print the same value twice, which is not incorrect but could be improved for clarity.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it assumes a fixed number of test cases (10) instead of using the input value of `t`. This will cause the program to fail for test cases with a different number of inputs.
