Output State: **stdin contains 1 input: t lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y, t is a string, x is an empty list, y is an empty list**

In this code snippet, the first line reads the integer value from stdin and assigns it to the variable t as a string. The second and third lines initialize two empty lists, x and y, respectively. No other variables are affected, and the remaining input in stdin (t lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y) remains unchanged.
