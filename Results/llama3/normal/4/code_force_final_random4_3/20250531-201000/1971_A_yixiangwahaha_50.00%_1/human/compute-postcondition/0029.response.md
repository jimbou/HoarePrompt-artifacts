Functionality: **The function reads two integers from standard input for ten iterations, stores them in separate lists, and then prints each pair of integers in ascending order. The function does not return any value but modifies the standard output by printing the sorted pairs. The function assumes that the input is well-formed and does not perform any error checking.**
