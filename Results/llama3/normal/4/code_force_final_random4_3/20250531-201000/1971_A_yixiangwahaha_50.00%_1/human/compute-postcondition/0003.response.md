According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 10, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1.
State: **x is a list containing one integer, y is a list containing one integer, stdin contains 0 inputs, t is a string, i is 1**
