Output: **`q` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `mn` is 100, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the values of the next three digits from the input, stdin contains q-3 lines, each containing three digits. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` but `b` is not less than `c`, 'PEAK' is printed. If `a` is not less than `b` or `b` is not less than `c`, 'NONE' is printed, and 'STAIR' is printed**
