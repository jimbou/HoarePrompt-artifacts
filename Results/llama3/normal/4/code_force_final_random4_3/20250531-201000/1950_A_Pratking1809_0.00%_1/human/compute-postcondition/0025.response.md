Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 1000, `mn` is 100, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the values of the next three digits from the input, stdin contains q-4 lines, each containing three digits.**

In this output state, the values of `q`, `mn`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the next three digits from the input, which are integers between 0 and 9. The stdin now contains q-4 lines, each containing three digits, as one line has been consumed by the input operation.
