This function reads a series of triple-digit numbers from standard input, determines the pattern of each triplet (either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE'), and prints the corresponding pattern for each triplet. The function processes a specified number of triplets, as indicated by the first integer read from standard input.
