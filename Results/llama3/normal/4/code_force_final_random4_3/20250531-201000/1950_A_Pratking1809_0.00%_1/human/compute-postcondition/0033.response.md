Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 1000, `mn` is 100, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the values of the next three digits from the input, stdin contains q-4 lines, each containing three digits. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` but `b` is not less than `c`, 'PEAK' is printed. If `a` is not less than `b`, 'NONE' is printed.***
