Output State: **q is an integer between 1 and 1000, mn is 100, stdin contains q lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9).**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `q`. Since the input is an integer between 1 and 1000, `q` becomes an integer between 1 and 1000. The second line assigns the value 100 to `mn`. No other variables are affected. The state of `stdin` remains the same, containing `q` lines, each with three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` between 0 and 9.
