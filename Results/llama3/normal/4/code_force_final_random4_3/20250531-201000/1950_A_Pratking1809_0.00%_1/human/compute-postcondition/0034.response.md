Output State: **`q` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `mn` is 100, `i` is `q`, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the values of the last three digits from the input, stdin is empty. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` but `b` is not less than `c`, 'PEAK' is printed. If `a` is not less than `b` or `b` is not less than `c`, 'NONE' is printed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop counter `i` is equal to the number of input lines `q`, and the input buffer is empty. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are the last three digits from the input. The output is a sequence of 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' strings, each corresponding to the comparison of `a`, `b`, and `c` in each iteration.
