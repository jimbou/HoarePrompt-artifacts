Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `mn` is 100, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, stdin contains q-1 lines, each containing three digits. The current value of `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, 'STAIR' is printed. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.***
