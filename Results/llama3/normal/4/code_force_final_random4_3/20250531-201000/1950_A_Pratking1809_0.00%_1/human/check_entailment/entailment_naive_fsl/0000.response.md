Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the input is "3 2 1". According to the problem description, this should output "NONE", but the program outputs nothing. This is because the program only checks for the "STAIR" and "PEAK" conditions, but does not handle the case where neither condition is met.

In the given program, the conditions for "STAIR" and "PEAK" are checked using if statements, but there is no else statement to handle the case where neither condition is true. As a result, the program does not output anything for inputs that do not meet either condition.

To fix this, the program should be modified to include an else statement that outputs "NONE" when neither the "STAIR" nor "PEAK" conditions are met. For example:

```
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

With this modification, the program will correctly output "NONE" for inputs that do not meet either the "STAIR" or "PEAK" conditions.
