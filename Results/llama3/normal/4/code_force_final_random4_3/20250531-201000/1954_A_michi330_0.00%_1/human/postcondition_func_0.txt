This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k. It then determines whether it is possible to satisfy a certain condition based on these integers and prints 'Yes' if possible, 'NO' otherwise. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results, ultimately consuming all input and producing output for each test case.
