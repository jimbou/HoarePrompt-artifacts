Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Alice can paint a ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. The program takes into account the number of parts (n), the number of colors (m), and the number of parts Bob can repaint (k).

The program's logic is based on the condition that if n is less than or equal to k, or if the number of parts that cannot be repainted to have the same color (n - math.ceil(n / m)) is less than k, then it is not possible for Alice to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. In this case, the program prints 'NO'.

On the other hand, if the number of parts that cannot be repainted to have the same color is greater than or equal to k, then it is possible for Alice to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. In this case, the program prints 'Yes'.

The program correctly implements the logic of the problem and produces the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
