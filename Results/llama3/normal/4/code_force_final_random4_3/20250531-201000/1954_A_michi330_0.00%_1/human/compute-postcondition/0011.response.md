Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `itest` is 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 50, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `itest` remain unchanged. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the first line of input from stdin, which contains three integers between 1 and 50. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, as one line has been consumed by the input operation.
