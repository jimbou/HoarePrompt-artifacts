The code accepts three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. The stdin contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. After accepting the first line, `t` becomes `t-1`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are now integers between 1 and 50. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 999, `itest` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 50, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.**
