Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 999, `itest` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 50, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. If either `n` is less than or equal to `k` or the difference between `n` and the ceiling of `n` divided by `m` is less than `k`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if `n` is larger than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is larger than or equal to `k`, then 'Yes' is printed.***
