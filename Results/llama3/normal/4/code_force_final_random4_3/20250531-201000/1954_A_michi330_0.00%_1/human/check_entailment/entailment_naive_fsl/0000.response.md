Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly determines whether it is possible for Alice to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. The program uses the condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` to check if Bob can repaint at most k parts to make all parts have the same color. If this condition is true, the program prints 'NO', indicating that Alice cannot paint the ribbon in such a way. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including the edge cases where n = 1, m = 1, or k = 1. The use of `math.ceil(n / m)` ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of parts that Bob needs to repaint to make all parts have the same color.

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
