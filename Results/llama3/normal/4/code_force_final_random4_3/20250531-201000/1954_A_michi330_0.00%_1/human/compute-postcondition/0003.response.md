Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 999, `itest` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 50, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. The current values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are such that either `n` is less than or equal to `k` or the difference between `n` and the ceiling of `n` divided by `m` is less than `k`.**
