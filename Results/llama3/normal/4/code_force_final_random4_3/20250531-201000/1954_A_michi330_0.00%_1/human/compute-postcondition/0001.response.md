To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `itest` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and 1000, we can conclude that `t` is at least 1.

The loop will iterate from `itest` = 0 to `t` with a step of 1. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `itest` to be 0, which is the starting value of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `itest` is 0, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50)**
