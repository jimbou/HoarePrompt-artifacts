Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 999, `itest` is 2, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 50, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of the first line of the input, stdin contains `t-2` lines, each containing three integers.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the values read from the first line of the input. The other variables, `t` and `itest`, remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `t-2` lines, each containing three integers, since one line has been read and processed.
