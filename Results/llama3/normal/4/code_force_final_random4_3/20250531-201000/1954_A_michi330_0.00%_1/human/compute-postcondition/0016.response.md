Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `itest` is 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 50, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n` minus the ceiling of `n` divided by `m` is less than `k`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed.***
