The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains one integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. After the code is executed, the value of `t` is assigned the integer from the input, and the stdin now contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50)**
