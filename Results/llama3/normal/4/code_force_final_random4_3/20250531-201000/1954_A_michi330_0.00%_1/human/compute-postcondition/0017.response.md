The only variable in the loop head is `itest` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `itest` and `t`. If `itest` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `itest` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 999. For the loop to execute again `itest` must be increased by 1 so `itest` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 999, `itest` is 2, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 50, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n` minus the ceiling of `n` divided by `m` is less than `k`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed.**
