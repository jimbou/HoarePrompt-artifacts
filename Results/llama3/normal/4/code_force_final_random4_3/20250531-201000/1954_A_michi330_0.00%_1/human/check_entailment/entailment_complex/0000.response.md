Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible for Alice to paint a ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. The program takes as input the number of parts (n), the number of colors (m), and the number of parts Bob can repaint (k).

The program uses a simple and correct logic to determine the possibility. If the number of parts (n) is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint (k), or if the number of parts minus the ceiling of the number of parts divided by the number of colors (n - math.ceil(n / m)) is less than the number of parts Bob can repaint (k), then it is not possible for Alice to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. In this case, the program prints 'NO'.

Otherwise, if none of the above conditions are met, it is possible for Alice to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. In this case, the program prints 'Yes'.

The program correctly handles all possible input cases and produces the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
