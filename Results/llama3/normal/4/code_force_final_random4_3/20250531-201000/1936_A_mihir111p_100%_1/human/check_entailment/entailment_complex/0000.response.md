Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find two indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ^ p_j` is maximized, where `p` is a secret permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`. The program uses a query function `func_1` to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the permutation.

The program first finds the index `ans1` of the maximum element in the permutation by comparing each element with the current maximum. Then, it finds the maximum element `mx` among the remaining elements that have the same bitwise OR as `ans1`. It stores the indices of these elements in the list `v`.

Next, the program finds the index `ans` of the maximum element among the elements in `v` by comparing each element with the current maximum.

Finally, the program prints the indices `ans` and `ans1` as the answer.

The program uses at most `3n` queries, which is within the allowed limit.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
