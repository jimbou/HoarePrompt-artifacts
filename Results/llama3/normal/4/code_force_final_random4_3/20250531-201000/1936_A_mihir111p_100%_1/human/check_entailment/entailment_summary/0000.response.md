Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required logic to find any two indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first finds the index `ans1` such that `p_ans1` is the maximum among all `p_i`. This is done by comparing each `p_i` with `p_ans1` using the `func_1` function, which asks a query to the jury and returns the result of the comparison.

2. Then, the program finds all indices `i` such that `p_i` is equal to `p_ans1`. This is done by comparing each `p_i` with `p_ans1` using the `func_1` function, and if the result is '=', `i` is added to the list `v`.

3. Finally, the program finds the index `ans` among the indices in `v` such that `p_ans` is the minimum among all `p_i` in `v`. This is done by comparing each `p_i` in `v` with `p_ans` using the `func_1` function, and if the result is '>', `ans` is updated to `i`.

4. The program then prints the result `! ans ans1`, which means that `p_ans ⊕ p_ans1` is maximized.

The program uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
