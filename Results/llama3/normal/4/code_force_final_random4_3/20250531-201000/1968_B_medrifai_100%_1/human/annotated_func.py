#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are binary strings, i and j are non-negative integers such that 0 <= i < len(a) and 0 <= j < len(b).
    index = b[j:].find(a[i])
    if (index != -1) :
        return j + index
        #The program returns the sum of j and index, where j is a non-negative integer less than the length of binary string b, and index is the index of the first occurrence of a[i:] in b[j:], which is not equal to -1, indicating that a[i:] is found in b[j:].
    else :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1, which is the value of the variable `index`, indicating that `a[i:]` is not found in `b[j:]`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function searches for the substring `a[i:]` within the substring `b[j:]` and returns the index of the first occurrence if found, or -1 if not found. The function takes binary strings `a` and `b`, and non-negative integers `i` and `j` as input, where `i` and `j` are indices within `a` and `b` respectively. The function returns an integer value indicating the position of the first occurrence of `a[i:]` in `b[j:]` or -1 if it's not found.
