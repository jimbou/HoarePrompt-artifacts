Output State: **`a` and `b` are binary strings, `i` and `j` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `i` < len(`a`) and 0 <= `j` < len(`b`), `index` is an integer equal to the index of the first occurrence of `a[i:]` in `b[j:]` or -1 if `a[i:]` is not found in `b[j:]`.**

In natural language, the output state is that `a` and `b` remain binary strings, and `i` and `j` remain non-negative integers within the bounds of `a` and `b`, respectively. A new variable `index` is introduced, which holds the index of the first occurrence of the substring `a[i:]` in the substring `b[j:]`. If `a[i:]` is not found in `b[j:]`, `index` is set to -1.
