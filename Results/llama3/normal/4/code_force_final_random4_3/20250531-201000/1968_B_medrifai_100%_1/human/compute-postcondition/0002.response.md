Output State: **The program returns the sum of j and index, where j is a non-negative integer less than the length of binary string b, and index is the index of the first occurrence of a[i:] in b[j:], which is not equal to -1, indicating that a[i:] is found in b[j:].**

In simpler terms, the program returns the position in string `b` where the substring `a[i:]` is found, considering the search starts from index `j` in string `b`.
