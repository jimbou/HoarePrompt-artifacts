Functionality: **This function searches for the substring `a[i:]` within the substring `b[j:]` and returns the index of the first occurrence if found, or -1 if not found. The function takes binary strings `a` and `b`, and non-negative integers `i` and `j` as input, where `i` and `j` are indices within `a` and `b` respectively. The function returns an integer value indicating the position of the first occurrence of `a[i:]` in `b[j:]` or -1 if it's not found.**
