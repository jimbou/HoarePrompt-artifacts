Output: **tests is greater than 2, i is 2, stdin contains tests-6 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, slength is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 2 characters, x is the second character in the string c. If the current value of x is not present in the strings a and b, then no is False. Otherwise, no remains True, and 'YES' is printed**
