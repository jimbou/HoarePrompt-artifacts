Output State: **tests is greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains tests-4 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, slength is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, no is True.**

In this output state, the code has consumed one test case from stdin, which originally contained tests-3 test cases. The values of tests and i remain unchanged. The code has also assigned values to slength, a, b, and c from the input. The variable no is initialized to True.
