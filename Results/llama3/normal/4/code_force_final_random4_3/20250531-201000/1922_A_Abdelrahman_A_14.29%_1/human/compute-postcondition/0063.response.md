Postcondition: **`tests` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains `tests-6` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 20) followed by three strings `a`, `b`, `c`, each consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `slength` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of `slength` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `slength` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `slength` lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, `x` is the first character in the string `c`, `no` is True. The current value of `x` is not present in the strings `a` and `b`.**
