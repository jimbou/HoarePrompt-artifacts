Postcondition: **`tests` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `tests-4` test cases, `slength` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 20, `a` is a string of `slength` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `slength` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `slength` lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character. If the first character of `c`, denoted as `x`, is not present in either string `a` or string `b`, then `no` is set to False and 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
