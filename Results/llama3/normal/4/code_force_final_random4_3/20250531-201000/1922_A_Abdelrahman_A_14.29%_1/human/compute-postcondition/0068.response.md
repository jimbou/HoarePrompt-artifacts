The only object in the loop head is variable  x and string c, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string c.  If the string c has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, c has at least 1 character, x is the first character in the string c. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string c must have at least 2 characters and the x is the second character in the string c.
State: **tests is greater than 2, i is 2, stdin contains tests-6 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, slength is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 2 characters, x is the second character in the string c. If the current value of x is not present in the strings a and b, then no is False. Otherwise, no remains True.**
