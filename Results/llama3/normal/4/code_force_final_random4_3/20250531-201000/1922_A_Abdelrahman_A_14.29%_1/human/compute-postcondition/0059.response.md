Output State: **`tests` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `no` is False, stdin contains `tests-6` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 20) followed by three strings `a`, `b`, `c`, each consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `slength` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of `slength` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `slength` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `slength` lowercase Latin letters.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `no` has been changed to False, while all other variables and stdin remain unchanged.
