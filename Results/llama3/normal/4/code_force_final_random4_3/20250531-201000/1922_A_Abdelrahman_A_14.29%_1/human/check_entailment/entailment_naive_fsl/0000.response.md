Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the strings a and b have the same character at a certain position, but the string c has a different character at that position. In this case, the program should print "YES" because a template can be created where the character at that position is uppercase, matching a and b but not c. However, the program does not handle this case correctly.

For example, if the input is:

3
aa
bb
ac

The program will print "NO", but the correct output should be "YES" because a template "Aa" can be created where the first character is uppercase 'A' and the second character is lowercase 'a', matching a and b but not c.
