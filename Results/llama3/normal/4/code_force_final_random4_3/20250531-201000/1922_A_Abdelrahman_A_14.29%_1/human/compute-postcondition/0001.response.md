The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and tests, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tests`. If tests is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, tests is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `tests` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`tests` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains tests-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.**
