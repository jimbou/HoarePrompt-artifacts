Postcondition: ***tests is greater than 2, i is 2, stdin contains tests-6 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, slength is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters. If c is equal to a or b, then 'NO' is printed. If any character in the string c is not present in the strings a and b, then 'NO' is printed. If c is not equal to a or b and all characters in c are present in both a and b, then 'NO' is printed.***
