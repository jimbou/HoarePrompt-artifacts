Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tests is greater than 2, i is 2, stdin contains tests-6 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, slength is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, no is True
Code of the loop:
for x in c:
    if x not in a and x not in b:
        print('YES')
        no = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *tests is greater than 2, i is 2, stdin contains tests-6 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, slength is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, x is the first character in the string c. If the current value of x is not present in the strings a and b, then no is False. Otherwise, no remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *tests is greater than 2, i is 2, stdin contains tests-6 test cases. If the second character in the string c is not present in the strings a and b, then no is False. Otherwise, no remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *tests is greater than 2, i is 2, stdin contains tests-6 test cases, x is the third character in the string c, c is a string that must have at least 3 characters. If the third character in the string c is not present in the strings a and b, then no is False. Otherwise, no is True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
