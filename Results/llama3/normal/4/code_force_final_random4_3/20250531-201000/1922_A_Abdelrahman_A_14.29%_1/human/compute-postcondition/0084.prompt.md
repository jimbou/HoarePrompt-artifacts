Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(tests):
    slength = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    c = input()
    no = True
    if c == a or c == b:
        no = False
        print('NO')
    else:
        for x in c:
            if x not in a and x not in b:
                print('YES')
                no = False
                break
    if no:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *tests is greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains tests-2 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, slength is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters. If c is equal to either a or b, 'NO' is printed and no is False. If c is not equal to a or b, then if any character in c is not present in a and not present in b, 'YES' is printed and no is False, otherwise no remains True. If no is True, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *tests is greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains tests-4 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, slength is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters. If c is equal to a or b, or if any character of c is not in a and not in b, then 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, no is True

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *tests is greater than 2, i is 2, stdin contains tests-6 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, slength is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters. If c is equal to a or b, then 'NO' is printed. If any character in the string c is not present in the strings a and b, then 'NO' is printed. If c is not equal to a or b and all characters in c are present in both a and b, then 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
