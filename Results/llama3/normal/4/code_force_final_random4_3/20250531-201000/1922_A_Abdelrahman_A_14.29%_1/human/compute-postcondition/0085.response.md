Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three strings of lowercase Latin letters. It checks if the third string is equal to either of the first two strings or if any character in the third string is not present in both the first two strings. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints nothing. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the input stream empty.**
