Postcondition: **tests is greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains tests-4 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, slength is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters. The current value of no is True, meaning that c is not equal to a or b, and all characters of c are in a or in b.**
