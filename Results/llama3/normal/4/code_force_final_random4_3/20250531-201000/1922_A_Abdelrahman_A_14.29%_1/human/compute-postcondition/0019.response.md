The only variable in the loop head is variable x and string c, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string c. If the string c has at least 3 characters the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, c has at least 2 characters, x is the second character in c. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string c must have at least 3 characters and the x is the third character in the string c.
State: **tests is greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains tests-2 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, slength is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 3 characters, no is False if the second character in c is not present in a and not present in b, otherwise no remains True, and c is neither equal to a nor equal to b, x is the third character in c, and 'YES' is printed if the second character in c is not present in a and not present in b.**
