Output State: **tests is greater than 2, i is 2, stdin contains tests-6 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, slength is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, no is True**

The code block reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to slength, then reads three strings from stdin and assigns them to a, b, and c, respectively. The value of no is set to True. The values of tests and i remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1.
