Output State: **tests is greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains tests-2 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, slength is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, no is True**

In this output state, the value of `tests` remains greater than 0, and `i` remains 0. The stdin now contains `tests-2` test cases because one test case has been consumed by the code. Each test case still contains an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, but the number of test cases has decreased by 1. The variable `slength` is assigned the value of the integer `n` from the input, which is between 1 and 20. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned strings of `slength` lowercase Latin letters from the input. The variable `no` is set to `True`.
