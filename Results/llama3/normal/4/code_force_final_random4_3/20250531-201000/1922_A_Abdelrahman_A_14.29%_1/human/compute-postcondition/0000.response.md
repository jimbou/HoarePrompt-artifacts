Output State: **`tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.**

In this output state, the variable `tests` has been assigned the value of the first integer input from stdin, which is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The remaining input in stdin is t-1 test cases, each containing an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, as described in the initial state.
