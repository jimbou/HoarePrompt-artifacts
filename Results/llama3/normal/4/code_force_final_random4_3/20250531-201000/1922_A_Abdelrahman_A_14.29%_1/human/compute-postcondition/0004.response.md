Output State: **tests is greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains tests-2 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, slength is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, no is False. The current value of c is equal to either a or b.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of tests is still greater than 0, the counter i remains at 0, and the standard input still contains tests-2 test cases. Each test case still consists of an integer n followed by three strings a, b, and c, with the same length and character constraints. The length of the strings a, b, and c is still between 1 and 20. The value of no has been changed to False. The relationship between the strings a, b, and c remains the same, with c being equal to either a or b.
