Output State: **tests is greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains tests-4 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, slength is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of slength lowercase Latin letters, no is False.**

The code sets the value of the variable "no" to False. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The state of the stdin also remains the same, containing tests-4 test cases.
