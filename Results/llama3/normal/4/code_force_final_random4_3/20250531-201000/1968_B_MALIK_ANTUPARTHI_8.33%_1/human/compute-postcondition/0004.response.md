Postcondition: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), b is an integer that is at least 1, c is an integer, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 0, k is 0, stdin contains a - 1 test cases, each consisting of two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings a and b of lengths n and m, respectively, j is 0. The current value of d[j] is found in the substring of e starting from index k.**
