Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), b is an integer that must be at least 1, c is an integer, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 1, j is 0, k is equal to j (which is 0), stdin contains a - 3 test cases, each consisting of two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings a and b of lengths n and m, respectively. The character at index j in string d is not present in the substring of e starting from index k.**
