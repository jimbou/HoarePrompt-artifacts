Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers and two binary strings. It then finds the maximum number of characters that can be matched between the two binary strings by iterating through the first string and finding the index of each character in the second string. The function prints the maximum number of matched characters for each test case.**
