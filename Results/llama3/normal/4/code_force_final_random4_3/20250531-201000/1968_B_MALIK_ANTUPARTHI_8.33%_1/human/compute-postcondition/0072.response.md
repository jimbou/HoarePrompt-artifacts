Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), b is an integer that must be at least 4, c is an integer, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 2, j is 3, k is 4**

The code snippet only contains two lines. The first line assigns the value of `j + 1` to `k`. Since `j` is 3, `k` becomes 4. The second line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables. Therefore, the only change is the new value of `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
