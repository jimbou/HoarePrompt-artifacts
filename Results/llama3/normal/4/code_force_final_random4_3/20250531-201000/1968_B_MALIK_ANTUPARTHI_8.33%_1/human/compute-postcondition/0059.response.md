Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), b is an integer that must be at least 1, c is an integer, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 2, j is at least 1, k is equal to j + 1, stdin contains a - 5 test cases, each consisting of two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings a and b of lengths n and m, respectively.**

In this output state, the value of k has been updated to be equal to j + 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains a - 5 test cases, each consisting of two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings a and b of lengths n and m, respectively.
