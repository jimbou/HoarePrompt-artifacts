The code snippet provided contains two lines: `k = j` and `break`. The first line assigns the value of `j` to `k`, and the second line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables.

Since `j` is 3, `k` becomes 3. No other variables are affected by the code.

Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), b is an integer that must be at least 4, c is an integer, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 2, j is 3, k is 3**
