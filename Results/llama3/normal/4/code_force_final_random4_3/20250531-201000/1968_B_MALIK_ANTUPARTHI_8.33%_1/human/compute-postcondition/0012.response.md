The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `b`. If `j` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `b` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `b` must be greater than 1.
State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), b is an integer that is at least 2, c is an integer, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 0, j is 1, k is equal to j + 1 if d[j] is in e[k:] and k is not equal to c and j is not equal to b - 1, otherwise k is equal to the index of the substring of e that contains the value of d[j] plus 1 if d[j] is in e[k:], otherwise k is equal to the original value of j. stdin contains a - 1 test cases, each consisting of two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings a and b of lengths n and m, respectively.**
