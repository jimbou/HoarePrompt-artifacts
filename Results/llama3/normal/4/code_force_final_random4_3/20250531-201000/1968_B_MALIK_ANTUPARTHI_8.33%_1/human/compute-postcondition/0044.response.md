The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `b`. If `j` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `b` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `b` must be greater than 2.
State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `b` is an integer that must be at least 3, `c` is an integer, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
