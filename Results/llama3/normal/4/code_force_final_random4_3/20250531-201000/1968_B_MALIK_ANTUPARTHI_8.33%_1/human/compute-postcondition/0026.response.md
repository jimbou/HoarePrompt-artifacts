Output: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), b is an integer, c is an integer, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 0, j is equal to b, k is equal to b if d[b - 1] is in e[k:] and k is not equal to c and b is greater than 1, otherwise k is equal to the index of the substring of e that contains the value of d[b - 1] plus 1 if d[b - 1] is in e[k:], otherwise k is equal to the original value of b - 1. stdin contains a - 1 test cases, each consisting of two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings a and b of lengths n and m, respectively, and the value of k is being printed.**
