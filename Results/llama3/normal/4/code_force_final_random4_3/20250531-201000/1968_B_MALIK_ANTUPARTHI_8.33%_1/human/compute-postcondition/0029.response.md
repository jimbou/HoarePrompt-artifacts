To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `b`. The loop will execute if `b` is at least 1. Since `j` is equal to `b` before the loop starts, we need to adjust `j` to be 0 (the starting value of the range) and `b` to be at least 1.

State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `b` is an integer that must be at least 1, `c` is an integer, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `k` is 0, stdin contains `a - 3` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively.**
