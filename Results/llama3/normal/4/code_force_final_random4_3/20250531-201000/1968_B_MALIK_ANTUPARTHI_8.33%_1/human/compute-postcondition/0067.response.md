Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `b` is an integer that must be at least 4, `c` is an integer, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3. If `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, then `k` is 4. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
