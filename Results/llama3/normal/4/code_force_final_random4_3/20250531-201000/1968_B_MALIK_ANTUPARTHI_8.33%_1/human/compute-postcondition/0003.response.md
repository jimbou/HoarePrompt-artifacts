According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `b` is an integer, so it needs to be adjusted to `b` is at least 1 and `j` is now 0.

State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), b is an integer that is at least 1, c is an integer, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 0, k is 0, stdin contains a - 1 test cases, each consisting of two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings a and b of lengths n and m, respectively, j is 0**
