Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), b is an integer that must be at least 3, c is an integer, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 1, j is 2, k is 3.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `j + 1` to `k`. Since `j` is 2, `k` becomes 3. The second line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables. Therefore, the only change in the output state is the value of `k`, which is now 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
