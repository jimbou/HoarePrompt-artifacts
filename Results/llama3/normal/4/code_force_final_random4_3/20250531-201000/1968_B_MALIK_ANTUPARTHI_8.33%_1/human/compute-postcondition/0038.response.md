The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `b`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `b`. If `j` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `b` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `b` must be greater than 1.
State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `b` is an integer that must be at least 2, `c` is an integer, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is either equal to `j + 1` if `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, or `k` remains unchanged if `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, otherwise `k` is equal to `j` (which is 1) if `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, stdin contains `a - 3` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively.**
