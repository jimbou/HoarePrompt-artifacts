Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `b` is an integer that must be at least 4, `c` is an integer, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` is the index of the substring `d[j]` in `e` plus 1.**

In this output state, the value of `k` is calculated by finding the index of the substring `d[j]` in `e` and adding 1 to it. The index is 1-based, meaning the first character in the string is at index 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
