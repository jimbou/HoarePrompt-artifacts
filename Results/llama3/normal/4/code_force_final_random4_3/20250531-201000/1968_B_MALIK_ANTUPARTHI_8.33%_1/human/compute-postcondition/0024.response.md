Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), b is an integer, c is an integer, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 0, j is equal to b, k is equal to b if d[b - 1] is in e[k:] and k is not equal to c and b is greater than 1, otherwise k is equal to the index of the substring of e that contains the value of d[b - 1] plus 1 if d[b - 1] is in e[k:], otherwise k is equal to the original value of b - 1. stdin contains a - 1 test cases, each consisting of two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings a and b of lengths n and m, respectively.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The value of `a` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).
- The value of `b` remains unchanged, still an integer.
- The value of `c` remains unchanged, still an integer.
- The value of `d` remains unchanged, still a binary string of length `b`.
- The value of `e` remains unchanged, still a binary string of length `c`.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged, still 0.
- The value of `j` is now equal to `b`, indicating that the loop has executed `b` times.
- The value of `k` depends on the last iteration of the loop. If `d[b - 1]` is in `e[k:]` and `k` is not equal to `c` and `b` is greater than 1, then `k` is equal to `b`. Otherwise, if `d[b - 1]` is in `e[k:]`, then `k` is equal to the index of the substring of `e` that contains the value of `d[b - 1]` plus 1. If `d[b - 1]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is equal to the original value of `b - 1`.
- The input in `stdin` remains unchanged, still containing `a - 1` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively.
