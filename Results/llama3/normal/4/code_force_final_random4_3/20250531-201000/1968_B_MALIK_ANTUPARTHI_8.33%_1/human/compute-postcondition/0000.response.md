The code `a = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively.

Since `a` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is `t`, the value of `a` is now `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). The stdin now contains `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `a` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively.**
