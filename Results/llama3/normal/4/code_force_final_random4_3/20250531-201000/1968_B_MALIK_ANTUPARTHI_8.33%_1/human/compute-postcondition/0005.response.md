Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), b is an integer that is at least 1, c is an integer, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 0, k is equal to the index of the substring of e that contains the value of d[j] plus 1, j is 0, stdin contains a - 1 test cases, each consisting of two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings a and b of lengths n and m, respectively.**

In this output state, the value of k has been updated to be equal to the index of the substring of e that contains the value of d[j] plus 1. This means that k now points to the position in e where the substring containing the value of d[j] starts, plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
