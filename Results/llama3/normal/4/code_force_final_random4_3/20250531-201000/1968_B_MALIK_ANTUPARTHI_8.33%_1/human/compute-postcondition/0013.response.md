Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `b` is an integer that is at least 2, `c` is an integer, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is equal to the index of the substring of `e` that contains the value of `d[j]` plus 1, stdin contains `a - 1` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to be equal to the index of the substring of `e` that contains the value of `d[j]` plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `a - 1` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively.
