Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `a` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    b, c = map(int, input().split())
    d = input()
    e = input()
    k = 0
    for j in range(b):
        if d[j] in e[k:]:
            k = e.index(d[j]) + 1
            if k == c or j == b - 1:
                k = j + 1
                break
        else:
            k = j
            break
    print(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), b is an integer, c is an integer, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 0, j is equal to b, k is equal to b if d[b - 1] is in e[k:] and k is not equal to c and b is greater than 1, otherwise k is equal to the index of the substring of e that contains the value of d[b - 1] plus 1 if d[b - 1] is in e[k:], otherwise k is equal to the original value of b - 1. stdin contains a - 1 test cases, each consisting of two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings a and b of lengths n and m, respectively, and the value of k is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `b`, `k` is either equal to `b` if `d[j]` is in `e[k:]` for all `j` in range `b`, or `k` is equal to the first `j` for which `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, stdin contains `a - 3` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively, and the value of `k` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), b is an integer, c is an integer, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 2, j is equal to b, k is equal to b, and the value of k which is equal to b is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
