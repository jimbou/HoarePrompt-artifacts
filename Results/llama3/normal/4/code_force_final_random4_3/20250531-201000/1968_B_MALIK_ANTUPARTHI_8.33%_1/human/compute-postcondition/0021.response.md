Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `b` is an integer that is at least 2, `c` is an integer, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, stdin contains `a - 1` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, then `k` is 3. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
