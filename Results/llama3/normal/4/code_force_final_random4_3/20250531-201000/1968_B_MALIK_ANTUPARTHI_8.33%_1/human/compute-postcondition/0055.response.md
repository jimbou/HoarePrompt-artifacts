To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `j` and the integer `b`. The loop will execute if `b` is at least 1. Since `j` is equal to `b`, we can adjust `j` to be at least 1 as well.

State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `b` is an integer that must be at least 1, `c` is an integer, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `i` is 2, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 0, stdin contains `a - 5` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively.**
