Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), b is an integer, c is an integer, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 2, j is equal to b, k is 0, stdin contains a - 5 test cases, each consisting of two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings a and b of lengths n and m, respectively.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The values of `b` and `c` are updated to the new integer values read from the input. The values of `d` and `e` are updated to the new binary strings read from the input. The value of `k` is reset to 0. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1.
