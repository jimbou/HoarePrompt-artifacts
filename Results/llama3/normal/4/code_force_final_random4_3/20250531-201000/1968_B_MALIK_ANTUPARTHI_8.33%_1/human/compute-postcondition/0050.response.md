Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `b`, `k` is either equal to `b` if `d[j]` is in `e[k:]` for all `j` in range `b`, or `k` is equal to the first `j` for which `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, stdin contains `a - 3` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows: The loop will iterate over the entire length of string `d`. If all characters in `d` are found in the corresponding substrings of `e`, then `k` will be equal to the length of `d` (i.e., `b`). If any character in `d` is not found in the corresponding substring of `e`, then `k` will be equal to the index of the first such character in `d`. The values of `a`, `c`, `e`, and `i` remain unchanged, and `j` will be equal to `b` after the loop finishes executing. The input in `stdin` remains the same.
