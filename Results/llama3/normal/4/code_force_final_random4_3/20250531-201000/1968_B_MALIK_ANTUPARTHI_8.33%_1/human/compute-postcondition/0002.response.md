Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), b is an integer, c is an integer, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 0, k is 0, stdin contains a - 1 test cases, each consisting of two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings a and b of lengths n and m, respectively.**

In this final state, the values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The values of `b` and `c` are assigned the two integers from the input, which are between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive). The values of `d` and `e` are assigned the two binary strings from the input, with lengths `b` and `c`, respectively. The value of `k` is initialized to 0. The stdin now contains `a - 1` test cases, as one test case has been consumed by the input operations.
