Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), b is an integer, c is an integer, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 1, j is equal to b, k is 0, stdin contains a - 3 test cases, each consisting of two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings a and b of lengths n and m, respectively.**

The code reads two integers from the input, assigns them to `b` and `c`, and then reads two binary strings, assigning them to `d` and `e`. The value of `k` is set to 0. The initial values of `a`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `k` is not affected by the code, as it is set to 0 regardless of the previous value. The stdin now contains `a - 3` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively.
