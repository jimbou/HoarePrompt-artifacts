To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for j in range(b):`, so we can only adjust the states of `j` and `b`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `b`. If `j` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `b` is at least 2.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` becomes 2. The value of `b` remains the same, which is at least 2.

State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `b` is an integer that is at least 2, `c` is an integer, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, if `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then `k` is either 2 or the index of the substring of `e` that contains the value of `d[j]` plus 1, otherwise `k` is equal to `j`. stdin contains `a - 1` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively.**
