Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the string `d` contains the same character multiple times in a row. In this case, the program will not correctly find the maximum possible number `k` such that a prefix of string `a` of length `k` is a subsequence of string `b`.

For example, if `d = "111"` and `e = "110"`, the program will output `1` instead of `2`, because it will only find the first occurrence of `1` in `e` and stop there.

To fix this issue, the program should continue searching for the next occurrence of the character in `e` after finding the first one, until it reaches the end of `e` or finds a character that is not in `e`.
