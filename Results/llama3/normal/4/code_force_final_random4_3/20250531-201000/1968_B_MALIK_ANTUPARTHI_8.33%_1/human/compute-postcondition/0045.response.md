Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `b` is an integer that must be at least 3, `c` is an integer, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is the index of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1.**

In this output state, the value of `k` is determined by finding the index of the character at position `j` in string `d` within string `e`, and then adding 1 to that index. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
