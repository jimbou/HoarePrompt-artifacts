The code `k = e.index(d[j]) + 1` assigns the value of the index of the substring `d[j]` in the string `e` plus 1 to the variable `k`. The value of `j` is 3, so `d[j]` is the 4th character of the binary string `d`. The string `e` has a length of `c`, which is an integer.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `b` is an integer that must be at least 4, `c` is an integer, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` is the index of the 4th character of `d` in `e` plus 1.**
