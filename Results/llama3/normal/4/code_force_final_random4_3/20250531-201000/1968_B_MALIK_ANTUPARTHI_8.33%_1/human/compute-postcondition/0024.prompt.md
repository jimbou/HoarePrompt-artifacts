Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), b is an integer, c is an integer, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 0, k is 0, stdin contains a - 1 test cases, each consisting of two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings a and b of lengths n and m, respectively.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(b):
    if d[j] in e[k:]:
        k = e.index(d[j]) + 1
        if k == c or j == b - 1:
            k = j + 1
            break
    else:
        k = j
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), b is an integer that is at least 1, c is an integer, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, i is 0, j is 0, k is equal to j + 1 if d[j] is in e[k:] and k is not equal to c and j is not equal to b - 1, otherwise k is equal to the index of the substring of e that contains the value of d[j] plus 1 if d[j] is in e[k:], otherwise k is equal to the original value of j. stdin contains a - 1 test cases, each consisting of two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings a and b of lengths n and m, respectively.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `b` is an integer that is at least 2, `c` is an integer, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, if `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then `k` is either 2 or the index of the substring of `e` that contains the value of `d[j]` plus 1, otherwise `k` is equal to `j`. stdin contains `a - 1` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `b` is an integer that is at least 2, `c` is an integer, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, stdin contains `a - 1` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, `k` is 3. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
