Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing two integers from `arr`, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

The code adds the integer at index `i` of `arr` to the set `s`. Since `i` is 1, the second element of `arr` is added to `s`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
