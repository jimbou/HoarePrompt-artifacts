Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` contains the first three elements of `arr`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the third element of `arr`, which is `arr[i]` where `i` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-3 test cases.
