The code adds the element at index `i` of `arr` to the set `s`. Since `i` is 2, the third element of `arr` is added to `s`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing the first three elements of `arr`, `i` is 2, `ans` is 1, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases**
