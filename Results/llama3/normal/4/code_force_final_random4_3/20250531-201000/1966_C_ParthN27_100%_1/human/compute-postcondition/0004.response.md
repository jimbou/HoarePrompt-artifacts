The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 1 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing one integer from `arr`, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases**
