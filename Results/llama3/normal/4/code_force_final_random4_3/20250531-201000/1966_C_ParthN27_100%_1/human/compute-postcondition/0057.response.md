To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 3, it must be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables in the state, `arr`, `s`, `ans`, `_`, and `stdin`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list of integers with 0 prepended, `ans` is 1 if the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is greater than 1, otherwise `ans` is 0, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.**
