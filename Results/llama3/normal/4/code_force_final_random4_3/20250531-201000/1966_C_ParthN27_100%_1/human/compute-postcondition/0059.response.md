Output State: **`n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list of integers with 0 prepended, `ans` is 0 if the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is greater than 1, otherwise `ans` is 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The length of the list `s` is still greater than or equal to 4, the value of `i` remains 2, the list `arr` is unchanged, the list `s` is still sorted with 0 prepended, the value of `ans` is now the opposite of its previous value (i.e., 0 if the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is greater than 1, otherwise 1), the value of `_` remains 1, and there are still `t-3` test cases in the standard input.
