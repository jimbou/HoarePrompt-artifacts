To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is larger than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but we know that `n` must be larger than 2, so `n` must be at least 3.

The other variables in the state, `s`, `arr`, `_`, `stdin`, `t`, and `ans`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is larger than 3, `i` is 2, `s` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr` with a prepended 0, `arr` is unchanged, `_` is still 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `ans` is either 0 or 1**
