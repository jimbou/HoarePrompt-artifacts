Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = set()
    for i in range(n):
        s.add(arr[i])
    s = list(s)
    s.sort()
    s = [0] + s
    ans = 1
    n = len(s)
    if n == 2:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:
                break
            else:
                ans ^= 1
        if ans:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is the number of unique integers in arr plus 1, s is a sorted list of unique integers from arr with a prepended 0, ans is either 0 or 1, i is n-1, arr is unchanged, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If n is 2, 'Alice' is being printed. If n is larger than 2, then if ans is 1, 'Alice' is being printed. If ans is 0, 'Bob' is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is the length of s, i is n, arr is a list of integers, s is a sorted list of integers with 0 prepended, ans is 1, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. If n is 2, 'Alice' is printed. If n is not 2, then if the difference between any two consecutive elements in s is greater than 1, 'Alice' is printed and ans is 1. If the difference between any two consecutive elements in s is not greater than 1, 'Bob' is printed and ans is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is the number of elements in s, s is a sorted list of integers starting with 0, ans is 1, i is an integer greater than or equal to 0, arr is a list of integers, _ is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases. If n is 2, 'Alice' is printed. If n is at least 3, 'Alice' is printed if the difference between any two consecutive elements of s is greater than 1, otherwise 'Bob' is printed and ans is n-1 modulo 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
