The code adds the element at index `i` of `arr` to the set `s`. Since `i` is 1, the second element of `arr` is added to `s`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains t-5 test cases.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing the first two elements of `arr`, `i` is 1, `ans` is 1, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases**
