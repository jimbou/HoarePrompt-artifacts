The code `ans ^= 1` is executed. This operation is equivalent to `ans = ans ^ 1`, where `^` is the bitwise XOR operator. The value of `ans` is either 0 or 1. 

When `ans` is 0, `ans ^ 1` equals 1. When `ans` is 1, `ans ^ 1` equals 0. Therefore, the value of `ans` is toggled.

The values of the other variables are not affected. The output state is: `n` is larger than 3, `i` is 2, `s` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr` with a prepended 0, `arr` is unchanged, `_` is still 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `ans` is either 1 or 0.
