Output State: **n is the length of s, i is n, arr is a list of integers, s is a sorted list of integers with 0 prepended, ans is 1, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `n` is now equal to the length of the list `s`. The value of `i` remains the same as `n`. The list `arr` remains unchanged. The set `s` has been converted to a sorted list of integers with 0 prepended to it. The value of `ans` is now 1. The value of `_` remains 1. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains t-3.
