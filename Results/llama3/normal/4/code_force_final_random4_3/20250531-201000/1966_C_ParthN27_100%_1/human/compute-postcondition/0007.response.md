The code adds the element at index `i` of `arr` to the set `s`. Since `i` is 2, the third element of `arr` is added to `s`. The size of `s` increases by 1, so it now contains three integers from `arr`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing three integers from `arr`, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-2 test cases**
