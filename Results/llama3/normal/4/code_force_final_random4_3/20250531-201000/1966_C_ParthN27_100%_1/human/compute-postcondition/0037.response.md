To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the loop head variables, which are `_` and `stdin` in this case.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`, which means the loop will execute as long as there are more test cases in `stdin`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. For the loop to execute again, `stdin` must contain at least one more test case.

The variable `_` is a throwaway variable, and its value doesn't affect the loop execution. However, since it's part of the loop head, we can increment its value by 1 for the next iteration.

The other variables (`n`, `s`, `ans`, `i`, `arr`, and `stdin`) are not part of the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

Here's the updated state:

State: **`n` is the number of unique integers in `arr` plus 1, `s` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr` with a prepended 0, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is unchanged, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases. If `n` is 2, 'Alice' is being printed. If `n` is larger than 2, then if `ans` is 1, 'Alice' is being printed. If `ans` is 0, 'Bob' is being printed.**
