Output State: **`n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list of integers with 0 prepended, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is greater than 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is 1.**

The code `ans ^= 1` flips the value of `ans`, so if `ans` was 0, it becomes 1, and if `ans` was 1, it becomes 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement is still valid, but the value of `ans` is now the opposite of what it was before.
