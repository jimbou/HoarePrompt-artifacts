Output State: **n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is an empty set, i is the length of s, ans is 1, _ is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases.**

The code first reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, replacing its initial value. Then, it reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `arr`, replacing its initial value. The third line creates an empty set and assigns it to `s`, replacing its initial value. The initial values of `i`, `ans`, and `_` are not modified by the code. The value of `i` is now the length of `s`, which is 0. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 2.
