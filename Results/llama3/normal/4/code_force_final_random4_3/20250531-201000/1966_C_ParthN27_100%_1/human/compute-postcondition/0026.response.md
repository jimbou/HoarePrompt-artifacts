Output State: **`n` is larger than 4, `i` is 3, `s` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr` with a prepended 0, `arr` is unchanged, `_` is still 0, `ans` is either 1 or 0, and `stdin` contains either `t-2` or `t-1` test cases.**

The code `ans ^= 1` flips the value of `ans`, so if `ans` was 0, it becomes 1, and if `ans` was 1, it becomes 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `stdin` is still either `t-2` or `t-1` test cases, depending on the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`.
