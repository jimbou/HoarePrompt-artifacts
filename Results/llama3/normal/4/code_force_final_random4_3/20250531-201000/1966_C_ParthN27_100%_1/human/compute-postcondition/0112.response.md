Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then determines the winner of a game based on the given integers, either 'Alice' or 'Bob', and prints the result. The function processes all test cases and leaves the standard input empty after execution.**
