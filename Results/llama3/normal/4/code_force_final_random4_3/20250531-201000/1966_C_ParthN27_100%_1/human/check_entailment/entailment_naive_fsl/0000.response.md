Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input is a single pile with an even number of stones. In this case, the program will print "Bob", but according to the problem description, Alice can win by choosing k=2 on her first turn, which will empty the pile at once.

For example, if the input is:

1
2

The program will print "Bob", but the correct output should be "Alice".
