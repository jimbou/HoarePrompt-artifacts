Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list of integers with 0 prepended, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is greater than 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.***
