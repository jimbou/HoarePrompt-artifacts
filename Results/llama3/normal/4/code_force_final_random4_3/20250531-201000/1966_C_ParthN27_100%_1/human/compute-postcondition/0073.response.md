Postcondition: ***n is the length of s, i is n, arr is a list of integers, s is a sorted list of integers with 0 prepended, ans is 1, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. If n is 2, 'Alice' is printed. If n is not 2, then if the difference between any two consecutive elements in s is greater than 1, 'Alice' is printed and ans is 1. If the difference between any two consecutive elements in s is not greater than 1, 'Bob' is printed and ans is 0.***
