Output State: **n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is an empty set, ans is either 0 or 1, i is n-1, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. If n is 2, 'Alice' was printed. If n is larger than 2, then if ans is 1, 'Alice' was printed. If ans is 0, 'Bob' was printed.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer value from the input. The list `arr` now contains the integers from the input. The set `s` is empty, as it was initialized but not populated. The values of `ans`, `i`, and `_` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in `stdin` has decreased by 2. The printing of 'Alice' or 'Bob' depends on the original value of `n` and `ans`.
