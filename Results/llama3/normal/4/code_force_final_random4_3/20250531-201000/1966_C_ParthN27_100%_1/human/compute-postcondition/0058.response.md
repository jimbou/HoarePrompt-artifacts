Output State: **`n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list of integers with 0 prepended, `ans` is 1 if the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is greater than 1, otherwise `ans` is 0, `_` is 1, stdin contains `t-4` test cases and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `arr`, `s`, `ans`, and `_` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the number of test cases in `stdin` decreases by 1, from `t-3` to `t-4`.
