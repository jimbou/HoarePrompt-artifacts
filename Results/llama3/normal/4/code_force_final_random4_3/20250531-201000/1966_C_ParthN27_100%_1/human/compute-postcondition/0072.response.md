Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list of integers with 0 prepended, `ans` is 1 if the difference between any two consecutive elements in `s` is greater than 1, otherwise `ans` is 0, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases. If `ans` is 1, 'Alice' is printed. If `ans` is 0, 'Bob' is printed.***
