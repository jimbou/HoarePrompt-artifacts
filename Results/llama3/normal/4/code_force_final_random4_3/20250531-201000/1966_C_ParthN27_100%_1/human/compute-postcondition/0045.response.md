Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` contains all elements of `arr`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the variable `i` equal to `n`, and the set `s` will contain all elements from the list `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
