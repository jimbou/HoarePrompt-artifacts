According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is an empty set, `i` is 0, `ans` is 1, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases.**
