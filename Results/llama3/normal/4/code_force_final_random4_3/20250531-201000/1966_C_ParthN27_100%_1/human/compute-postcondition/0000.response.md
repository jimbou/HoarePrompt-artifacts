The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). So for the loop to be executed  the stdin must contain an integer t that is greater than 0 and _ is 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t that is greater than 0 followed by t test cases, _ is 0**
