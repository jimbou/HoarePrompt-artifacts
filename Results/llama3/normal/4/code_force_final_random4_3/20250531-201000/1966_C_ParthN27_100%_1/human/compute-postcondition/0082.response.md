Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing all elements of `arr`, `i` is equal to `n`, `ans` is 1, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is: The integer `n` is greater than or equal to 0, the list `arr` contains integers, the set `s` contains all elements of `arr`, the variable `i` is equal to `n`, the variable `ans` is 1, the variable `_` is 2, and the standard input contains t-5 test cases.
