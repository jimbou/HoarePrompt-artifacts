Postcondition: ***`n` is larger than 2, `i` is 1, `s` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr` with a prepended 0, `arr` is unchanged, `_` is still 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.***
