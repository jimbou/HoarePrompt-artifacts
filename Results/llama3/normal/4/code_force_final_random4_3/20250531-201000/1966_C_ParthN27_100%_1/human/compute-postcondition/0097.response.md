Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `s` is a sorted list of integers starting with 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases. If the difference between the second element of `s` and the first element of `s` is greater than 1, `ans` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.***
