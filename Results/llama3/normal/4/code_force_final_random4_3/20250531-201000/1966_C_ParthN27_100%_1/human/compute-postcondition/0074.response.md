The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. So for the loop to be executed one more time the stdin must contain t-4 test cases and _ is 2.
State: **n is the length of s, i is n, arr is a list of integers, s is a sorted list of integers with 0 prepended, ans is 1, _ is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases.**
