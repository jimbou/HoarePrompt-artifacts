Output State: **`n` is larger than 2, `i` is 1, `s` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr` with a prepended 0, `ans` is 1, `arr` is unchanged, `_` is still 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `s`, `ans`, `arr`, and `_` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
