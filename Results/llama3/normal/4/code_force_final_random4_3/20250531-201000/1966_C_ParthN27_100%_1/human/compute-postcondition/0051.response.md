To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 3, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n - 1`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list of integers with 0 prepended, `ans` is 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases**
