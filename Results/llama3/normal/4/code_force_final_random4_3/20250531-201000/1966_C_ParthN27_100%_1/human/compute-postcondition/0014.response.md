The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is larger than 2, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be within the range of the loop. Since the loop starts from 1 and ends at `n-1`, we can set `i` to be 1.

State: **`n` is larger than 2, `i` is 1, `s` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr` with a prepended 0, `ans` is 1, `arr` is unchanged, `_` is still 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases**
