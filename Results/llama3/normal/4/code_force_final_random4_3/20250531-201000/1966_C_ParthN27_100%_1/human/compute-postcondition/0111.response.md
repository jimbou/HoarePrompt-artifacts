Output State: **stdin is empty, _ is t, arr is a list of integers, s is a sorted list of integers with 0 prepended, ans is either 0 or 1, i is an integer greater than or equal to 0, n is the number of elements in s.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the input buffer will be empty, the loop counter `_` will be equal to the initial number of test cases `t`, the array `arr` will contain the last set of integers read from the input, the set `s` will contain the unique integers from the last set of integers in sorted order with a prepended 0, the variable `ans` will be either 0 or 1 depending on the outcome of the game, the variable `i` will be an integer greater than or equal to 0, and the variable `n` will be the number of elements in the set `s`.
