Output State: **`n` is larger than 2, `i` is 1, `s` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr` with a prepended 0, `ans` is 0, `arr` is unchanged, `_` is still 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, and the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is less than or equal to 1**

The code `ans ^= 1` flips the value of `ans` by performing a bitwise XOR operation with 1. Since `ans` was initially 1, the result of the operation is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
