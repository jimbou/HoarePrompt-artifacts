Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `s` is a sorted list of integers starting with 0, `ans` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, and the difference between the second element of `s` and the first element of `s` is less than or equal to 1**

The code `ans ^= 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation on the value of `ans` with 1. Since `ans` was initially 1, the result of this operation is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
