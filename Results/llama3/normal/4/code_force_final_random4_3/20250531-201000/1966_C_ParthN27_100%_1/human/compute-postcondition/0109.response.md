Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is a sorted list of integers starting with 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases. If the difference between any two consecutive elements of `s` is greater than 1, `ans` is 1 and 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, `ans` is `n-1` modulo 2 and 'Bob' is printed.***
