Postcondition: ***n is the number of unique integers in arr plus 1, s is a sorted list of unique integers from arr with a prepended 0, ans is either 0 or 1, i is n-1, arr is unchanged, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If n is 2, 'Alice' is being printed. If n is larger than 2, then if ans is 1, 'Alice' is being printed. If ans is 0, 'Bob' is being printed.***
