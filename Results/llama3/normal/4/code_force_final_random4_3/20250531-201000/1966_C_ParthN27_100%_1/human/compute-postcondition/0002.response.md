To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 0 and set `i` to 0, as it will be the initial value in the range.

State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer greater than 0, arr is a list of integers, s is an empty set, _ is 0, i is 0**
