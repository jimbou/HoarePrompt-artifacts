Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `s` is a sorted list of integers starting with 0, `ans` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is still greater than 1.
