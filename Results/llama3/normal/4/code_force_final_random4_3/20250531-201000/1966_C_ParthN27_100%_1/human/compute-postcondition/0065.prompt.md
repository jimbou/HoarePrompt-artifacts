Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *n is the length of s, i is n, arr is a list of integers, s is a sorted list of integers with 0 prepended, ans is 1, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, and n is not equal to 2
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:
        break
    else:
        ans ^= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list of integers with 0 prepended, `ans` is 1 if the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is greater than 1, otherwise `ans` is 0, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list of integers with 0 prepended, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is greater than 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list of integers with 0 prepended, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is greater than 1, then `ans` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
