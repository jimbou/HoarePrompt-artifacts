State: **`n` is larger than 4, `i` is 3, `s` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr` with a prepended 0, `arr` is unchanged, `_` is still 0. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases. Otherwise, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. In both cases, `ans` is either 0 or 1.**
