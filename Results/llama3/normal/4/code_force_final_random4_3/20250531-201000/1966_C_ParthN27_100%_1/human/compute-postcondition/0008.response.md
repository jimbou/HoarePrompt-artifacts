Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing all unique integers from `arr`, `_` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the set `s` will contain all unique integers from the list `arr`, and the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, where `n` is the number of elements in `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
