To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 3, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n - 1`. 

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `s` is a sorted list of integers starting with 0, `ans` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases**
