Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `s` is a sorted list of integers starting with 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases. If the difference between the second element of `s` and the first element of `s` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.***
