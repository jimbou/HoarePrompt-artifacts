Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing one integer from `arr`, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include one integer from the list `arr`, specifically the integer at index `i` (which is 0). The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
