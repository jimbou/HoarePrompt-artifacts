According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `costs`. If the list `costs` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer less than `n`, `h` is 0 and `costs` is a list containing two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the variable `i` is the first element in the list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer less than `n`, `h` is 0, `costs` is a list containing two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1` that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list**
