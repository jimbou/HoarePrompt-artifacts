Based on the precondition, the code will print the string 'YES'. The value of the variable n is 0, and the value of the variable k is a positive integer less than n, which is not possible since n is 0. However, the code does not use these variables in the print statement. The print statement simply prints the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
