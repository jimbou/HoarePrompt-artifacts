Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether it is possible to divide a given positive integer `n` into `k` parts such that the sum of the parts is greater than or equal to `k`. The program handles all possible cases correctly, including when `n` is equal to `k`, when `n` is less than `k`, and when `n` is greater than `k`. The program also correctly calculates the sum of the parts by dividing `n` into two parts: `n - k + 1` and `1`, and checks if the sum is greater than or equal to `k`. If the sum is less than `k`, the program prints 'NO'. If the sum is greater than or equal to `k`, the program prints 'YES', the number 2, and the sizes of the two parts.

Correctness: **True**
