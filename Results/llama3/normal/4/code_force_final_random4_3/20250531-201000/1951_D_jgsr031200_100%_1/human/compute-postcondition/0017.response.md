To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in costs:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `costs`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the `costs` list to iterate over. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the first element in the list, and `costs` contains two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`.

For the loop to execute again, `i` should be the next element in the list, which is `1`. The state of `costs` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop iteration.

The other variables, `n`, `k`, and `curr`, are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer less than `n`, `h` is `curr`, `costs` is a list containing two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`, `i` is `1`, `curr` is `n // 1`**
