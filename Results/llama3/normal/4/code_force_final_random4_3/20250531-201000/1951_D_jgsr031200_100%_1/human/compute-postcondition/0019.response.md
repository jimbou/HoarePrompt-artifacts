To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in costs:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `costs`.

According to the code, `costs` is a list containing two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `1`, which means it has already iterated over the first element of the list (`n - k + 1`).

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to move to the next element in the list, which is `1`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` to `1`.

The state of `costs` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `h`, and `curr`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer less than `n`, `h` is `curr + n // 1`, `costs` is a list containing two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`, `i` is `1`, `curr` is `n // 1`, `n` is `n - i * (n // i)`**
