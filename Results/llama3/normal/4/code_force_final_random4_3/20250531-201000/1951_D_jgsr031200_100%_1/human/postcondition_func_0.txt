This function determines whether it is possible to divide a given positive integer `n` into `k` parts such that the sum of the parts is greater than or equal to `k`. It takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. If 'YES' is printed, it also prints the number of parts and the sizes of the parts. If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES' and the number 1 twice. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of the parts by dividing `n` into two parts: `n - k + 1` and `1`, and checks if the sum is greater than or equal to `k`. If the sum is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'. If the sum is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints 'YES', the number 2, and the sizes of the two parts.
