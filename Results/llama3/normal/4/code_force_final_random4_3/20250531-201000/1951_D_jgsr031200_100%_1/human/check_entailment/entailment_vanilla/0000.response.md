Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can set up his jewelry store in such a way that Alice buys exactly k jewels. The program takes two inputs, n and k, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively.

The program first checks if n is equal to k. If they are equal, it means that Alice can buy exactly k jewels with her n coins, and the program prints 'YES' along with the price of 1 coin per jewel.

If n is less than k, it means that Alice does not have enough coins to buy k jewels, and the program prints 'NO'.

If n is greater than k, the program calculates the cost of the first stall as n - k + 1. This is because Alice will buy as many jewels as possible from the first stall, leaving her with n - k + 1 coins. The cost of the second stall is set to 1, which means that Alice will buy one jewel from the second stall.

The program then calculates the total number of jewels Alice can buy from the two stalls. If the total number of jewels is less than k, it means that Bob cannot set up his store in such a way that Alice buys exactly k jewels, and the program prints 'NO'.

If the total number of jewels is greater than or equal to k, it means that Bob can set up his store in such a way that Alice buys exactly k jewels, and the program prints 'YES' along with the prices of the two stalls.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible scenarios. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
