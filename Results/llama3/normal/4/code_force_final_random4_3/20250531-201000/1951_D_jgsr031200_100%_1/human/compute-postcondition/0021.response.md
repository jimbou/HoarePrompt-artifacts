Output State: **n is 0, k is a positive integer less than n, h is the sum of n // (n - k + 1) + n // 1 + n // 1 + ... + n // 1 (k - 1 times), costs is a list containing two elements: n - k + 1 and 1, i is 1, curr is 0, n is 0**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of n becomes 0, k remains a positive integer less than n, h becomes the sum of the integer divisions of n by (n - k + 1) and 1 repeated (k - 1) times, the list costs remains unchanged, i becomes 1, curr becomes 0, and n becomes 0.
