Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when `n` is equal to `k` and `n` is greater than 1. In this case, the program prints "YES" and then prints 1 and 1, but it should print "YES" and then print 1 and `n`, because Alice can buy `n` jewels at a price of 1 coin each.

For example, if the input is `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the program prints "YES" and then prints 1 and 1, but the correct output should be "YES" and then print 1 and 2, because Alice can buy 2 jewels at a price of 1 coin each.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
