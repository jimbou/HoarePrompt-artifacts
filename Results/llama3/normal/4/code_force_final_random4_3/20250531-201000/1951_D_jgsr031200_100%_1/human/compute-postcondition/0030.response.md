The code prints the elements of the `costs` list. Based on the precondition, the `costs` list contains two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`. Since `n` is 0 and `k` is a positive integer less than `n`, `n - k + 1` is equal to `1 - k + 1` which is equal to `2 - k`. However, since `k` is a positive integer less than `n` and `n` is 0, `k` must be 0 (because there are no positive integers less than 0). Therefore, `2 - k` is equal to `2 - 0` which is equal to `2`. So, the `costs` list contains two elements: `2` and `1`. 

Output: **2 1**
