Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer less than n, h is curr + n // 1 + curr, costs is a list containing two elements: n - k + 1 and 1, i is 1, curr is n // i, n is n - i * (n // i) - i * curr**

The code modifies the values of `curr`, `h`, and `n`. The first line assigns the value of `n // i` to `curr`. The second line increments `h` by the value of `curr`, making `h` equal to `curr + n // 1 + curr`. The third line decrements `n` by the value of `i * curr`, making `n` equal to `n - i * (n // i) - i * curr`. The values of `k`, `costs`, and `i` remain unchanged.
