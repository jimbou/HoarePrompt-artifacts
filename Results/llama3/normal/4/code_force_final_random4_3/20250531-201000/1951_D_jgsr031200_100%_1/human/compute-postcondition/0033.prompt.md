You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18.
    if (n == k) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return
        #The program returns nothing, 'YES' is printed, and the number 1 is printed twice. The values of n and k remain unchanged as positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is still equal to k.
    #State: *n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is not equal to k
    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: *n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k
    costs = [n - k + 1, 1]
    h = 0
    for i in costs:
        curr = n // i
        
        h += curr
        
        n -= i * curr
        
    #State: n is 0, k is a positive integer less than n, h is the sum of n // (n - k + 1) + n // 1 + n // 1 + ... + n // 1 (k - 1 times), costs is a list containing two elements: n - k + 1 and 1, i is 1, curr is 0, n is 0
    if (h < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(*costs)
        #This is printed: 2 1
    #State: *n is 0, k is a positive integer less than n, h is the sum of n // (n - k + 1) + n // 1 + n // 1 + ... + n // 1 (k - 1 times), costs is a list containing two elements: n - k + 1 and 1, i is 1, curr is 0. If h is less than k, 'NO' is printed. If h is larger than or equal to k, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the elements of the list costs which are n - k + 1 and 1 are printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing, 'YES' is printed, and the number 1 is printed twice. The values of n and k remain unchanged as positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is still equal to k.

Case_2: The program returns nothing.

Case_3: n is 0, k is a positive integer less than n, h is the sum of n // (n - k + 1) + n // 1 + n // 1 + ... + n // 1 (k - 1 times), costs is a list containing two elements: n - k + 1 and 1, i is 1, curr is 0, and the current value of h is less than k, and 'NO' is being printed

Case_4: n is 0, k is a positive integer less than n, h is the sum of n // (n - k + 1) + n // 1 + n // 1 + ... + n // 1 (k - 1 times), costs is a list containing two elements: n - k + 1 and 1, i is 1, curr is 0, n is 0, and h is larger than or equal to k, and 'YES' is being printed, and the number 2 is being printed, and the elements of the list costs which are n - k + 1 and 1 are being printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
