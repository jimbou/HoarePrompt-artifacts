Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether it is possible for Bob to set up the store such that Alice buys exactly k jewels. The program first checks if n is equal to k, in which case it is possible to set up the store with a single stall with a price of 1. If n is less than k, it is not possible to set up the store, so the program prints 'NO'. If n is greater than or equal to k, the program calculates the number of jewels that can be bought at each stall and checks if the total number of jewels that can be bought is greater than or equal to k. If it is, the program prints 'YES' and the prices for the stalls. If it is not, the program prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles the case where n is equal to k, and it correctly calculates the number of jewels that can be bought at each stall. The program also correctly checks if the total number of jewels that can be bought is greater than or equal to k.

Correctness: **True**
