Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n where the last three elements are equal, le is n, l is less than n - 2, r is n - 3, st is the number of elements in a that are equal to the first element of a, end is 3, ans is max(0, n - (st + end)) if the first element of a is equal to the last element of a, otherwise remains the same as the precondition, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: first an integer n, then a space-separated list of n integers, and ans is printed.**

The code modifies the values of `r` and `end`. The first line decrements `r` by 1, changing its value from `n - 2` to `n - 3`. The second line increments `end` by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
