Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n, le is n, l is 0, r is n - 1, st is 1, end is 1, ans is max(0, n - (st + end)) if the first element of a is equal to the last element of a. Otherwise, ans remains the same as the precondition, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: first an integer n, then a space-separated list of n integers, and ans is printed**

The code block reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from `stdin`, and assigns them to `n` and `a` respectively. It then sets `le` to the length of `a`, which is `n`. The variables `l` and `r` are set to 0 and `n - 1` respectively. The variables `st` and `end` are set to 1. The value of `ans` is updated based on the condition that the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`. If this condition is true, `ans` is set to `max(0, n - (st + end))`. Otherwise, `ans` remains the same as the precondition. The code also prints the value of `ans`. The state of `t` remains unchanged. The state of `stdin` is updated to contain `t - 2` inputs.
