Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n, where the last end elements are equal, le is n, l is less than n - end + 1, r is n - end, st is the number of consecutive equal elements at the beginning of a, end is the number of consecutive equal elements at the end of a, ans is n - max(st, end), stdin contains t - 1 inputs: first an integer n, then a space-separated list of n integers.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been calculated as `le - max(st, end)`, which is equivalent to `n - max(st, end)`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains `t - 1` inputs, which are the remaining inputs after the current input has been processed.
