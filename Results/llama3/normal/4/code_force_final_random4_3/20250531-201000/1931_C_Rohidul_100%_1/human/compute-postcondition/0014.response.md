Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n, where the last four elements are equal, le is n, l is less than n - 4, r is n - 4, st is the number of consecutive equal elements at the beginning of a, end is 4, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: first an integer n, then a space-separated list of n integers**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been decremented by 1, making it `n - 4`. The value of `end` has been incremented by 1, making it 4. The last four elements of the list `a` are now equal. All other variables remain unchanged.
