Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n with at least three consecutive equal elements, le is n, l is less than r, r is greater than l and less than its original value by 1, st is the number of elements in a that are equal to the first element of a, end is end + 3, ans is unchanged, and stdin contains no input.**

In this final state, the value of `r` has been decremented by 1, and the value of `end` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
