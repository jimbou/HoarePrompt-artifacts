Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n, le is n, l is the index of the first element in a that is not equal to the first element of a, r is the index of the last element in a that is equal to the first element of a, st is the number of elements in a that are equal to the first element of a, end is the number of elements in a that are equal to the last element of a, ans is max(0, n - (st + end)) if the first element of a is equal to the last element of a, otherwise remains the same as the precondition, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: first an integer n, then a space-separated list of n integers, and ans is printed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop will continue to decrement `r` and increment `end` until `r` is no longer greater than `l` or `a[r]` is not equal to `a[r - 1]`. At this point, `r` will be the index of the last element in `a` that is equal to the first element of `a`, and `end` will be the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the last element of `a`. The other variables will remain unchanged.
