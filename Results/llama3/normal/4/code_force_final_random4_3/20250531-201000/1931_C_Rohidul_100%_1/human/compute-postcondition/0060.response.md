Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers less than or equal to `n` with at least two consecutive equal elements, `le` is `n`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `r` is greater than or equal to `l`, `st` is the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the first element of `a`, `end` is `end + k`, `ans` is `n - max(st, end + k)`, and stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the difference between `n` and the maximum of `st` and `end + k`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin is still empty.
