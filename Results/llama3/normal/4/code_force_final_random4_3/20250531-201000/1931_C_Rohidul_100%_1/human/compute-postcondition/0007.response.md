Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n must be greater than 2, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n with the first four elements being equal, le is n, l is 3, r is greater than 2, st is 4, end is 1, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: first an integer n, then a space-separated list of n integers.**

The code increments the value of `l` by 1, making it 3, and increments the value of `st` by 1, making it 4. No other variables are affected.
