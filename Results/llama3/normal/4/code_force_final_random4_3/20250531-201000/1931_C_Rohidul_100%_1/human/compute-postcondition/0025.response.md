Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n with the first two elements being equal, le is n, l is 1, r is n - 1, st is 2, end is 1, ans is max(0, n - (st + end)) if the first element of a is equal to the last element of a, otherwise remains the same as the precondition, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: first an integer n, then a space-separated list of n integers, and ans is printed**

The code increments `l` by 1, making it 1, and increments `st` by 1, making it 2. No other variables are affected. The value of `ans` is updated based on the condition that the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`. If this condition is true, `ans` becomes `max(0, n - (st + end))`, otherwise it remains the same as the precondition.
