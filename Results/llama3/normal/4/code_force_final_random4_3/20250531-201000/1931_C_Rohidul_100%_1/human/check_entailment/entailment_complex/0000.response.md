Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the list so that the remaining elements are either all equal to the first element or all equal to the last element.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the size of the array, and the array elements.
2. It initializes the variables `l`, `r`, `st`, and `end` correctly, where `l` and `r` are the indices of the first and last elements of the array, and `st` and `end` are the counts of consecutive elements equal to the first and last elements, respectively.
3. The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum count of consecutive elements equal to the first or last element. It does this by iterating from the start and end of the array, incrementing `st` and `end` as long as the elements are equal to the first or last element.
4. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of elements that need to be removed, which is the length of the array minus the maximum count of consecutive elements equal to the first or last element.
5. If the first and last elements are the same, the program correctly calculates the maximum number of elements that can be removed while still satisfying the condition, which is the length of the array minus the sum of `st` and `end`.
6. The program prints the result correctly for each test case.

Overall, the program is correct and implements the desired logic.

Correctness: **True**
