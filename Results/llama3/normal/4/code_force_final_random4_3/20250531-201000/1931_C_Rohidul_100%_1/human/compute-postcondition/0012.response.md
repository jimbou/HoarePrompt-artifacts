Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n, where the last two elements are equal, le is n, l is less than n - 2, r is n - 3, st is the number of consecutive equal elements at the beginning of a, end is 3, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: first an integer n, then a space-separated list of n integers**

The code snippet modifies the values of `r` and `end`. The first line decrements `r` by 1, changing its value from `n - 2` to `n - 3`. The second line increments `end` by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
