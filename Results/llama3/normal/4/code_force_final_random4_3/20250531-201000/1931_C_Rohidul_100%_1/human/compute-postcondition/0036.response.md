Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n where the last three elements are equal, le is n, l is less than n - 3, r is n - 4, st is the number of elements in a that are equal to the first element of a, end is 4, ans is max(0, n - (st + end)) if the first element of a is equal to the last element of a, otherwise remains the same as the precondition, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: first an integer n, then a space-separated list of n integers, and ans is printed.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `r` and `end`. The first line decrements `r` by 1, making it `n - 4`. The second line increments `end` by 1, making it 4. The value of `ans` is not directly modified by the code snippet, but its value depends on the first element of `a` and the last element of `a`. If they are equal, `ans` is the maximum of 0 and `n - (st + end)`, otherwise it remains the same as the precondition. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `le`, `l`, and `st` remain unchanged.
