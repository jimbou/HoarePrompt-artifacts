The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `input()`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `input()`. If `input()` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple inputs: first an integer t, then for each test case, first an integer n, then a space-separated list of n integers. The integers are non-negative and less than or equal to n. So for the loop to be executed `input()` must be greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple inputs: first an integer t that must be greater than 0, then for each test case, first an integer n, then a space-separated list of n integers. The integers are non-negative and less than or equal to n, `_` is 0**
