Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n, le is n, l is the index of the first element in a that is not equal to the first element of a, r is n - 1, st is the number of elements in a that are equal to the first element of a, end is 1, ans is max(0, n - (st + end)) if the first element of a is equal to the last element of a, otherwise remains the same as the precondition, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: first an integer n, then a space-separated list of n integers, and ans is printed.
Code of the loop:
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
    r -= 1
    end += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n where the last two elements are equal, le is n, l is less than n - 1, r is n - 2, st is the number of elements in a that are equal to the first element of a, end is 2, ans is max(0, n - (st + end)) if the first element of a is equal to the last element of a, otherwise remains the same as the precondition, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: first an integer n, then a space-separated list of n integers, and ans is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n where the last three elements are equal, le is n, l is less than n - 2, r is n - 3, st is the number of elements in a that are equal to the first element of a, end is 3, ans is max(0, n - (st + end)) if the first element of a is equal to the last element of a, otherwise remains the same as the precondition, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: first an integer n, then a space-separated list of n integers, and ans is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n where the last three elements are equal, le is n, l is less than n - 3, r is n - 4, st is the number of elements in a that are equal to the first element of a, end is 4, ans is max(0, n - (st + end)) if the first element of a is equal to the last element of a, otherwise remains the same as the precondition, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: first an integer n, then a space-separated list of n integers, and ans is printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
