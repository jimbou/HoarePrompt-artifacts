You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple inputs: first an integer t, then for each test case, first an integer n, then a space-separated list of n integers. The integers are non-negative and less than or equal to n.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        le = len(a)
        
        l, r = 0, n - 1
        
        st, end = 1, 1
        
        while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
            l += 1
            st += 1
        
        while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
            r -= 1
            end += 1
        
        ans = le - max(st, end)
        
        if a[0] == a[-1]:
            ans = max(0, le - (st + end))
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n, le is n, l is less than or equal to r, r is greater than or equal to l, st is the number of elements in a that are equal to the first element of a, end is the number of elements in a that are equal to the last element of a, ans is n - max(st, end) if the first element of a is not equal to the last element of a. Otherwise, ans is max(0, le - (st + end)), and ans is printed, and stdin contains no input.

```

Return Postconditions: t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n, le is n, l is less than or equal to r, r is greater than or equal to l, st is the number of elements in a that are equal to the first element of a, end is the number of elements in a that are equal to the last element of a, ans is n - max(st, end) if the first element of a is not equal to the last element of a. Otherwise, ans is max(0, le - (st + end)), and ans is printed, and stdin contains no input.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
