Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n, where the last two elements are equal, le is n, l is the index of the first element in a that is not equal to the first element in a, r is n - 2, st is the number of consecutive equal elements at the beginning of a, end is 2, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: first an integer n, then a space-separated list of n integers.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `r` and `end`. The first line decrements `r` by 1, changing its value from `n - 1` to `n - 2`. The second line increments `end` by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
