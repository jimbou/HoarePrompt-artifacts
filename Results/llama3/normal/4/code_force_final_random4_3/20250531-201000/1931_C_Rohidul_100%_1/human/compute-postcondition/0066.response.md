Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n, le is n, l is less than or equal to r, r is greater than or equal to l, st is the number of elements in a that are equal to the first element of a, end is the number of elements in a that are equal to the last element of a, ans is n - max(st, end) if the first element of a is not equal to the last element of a. Otherwise, ans is max(0, le - (st + end)), and ans is printed, and stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the test cases, and for each test case, it has calculated the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the list to make all elements distinct. The loop has also printed the result for each test case. The input stream is empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
