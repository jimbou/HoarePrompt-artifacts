Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple inputs: first an integer t, then for each test case, first an integer n, then a space-separated list of n integers. The integers are non-negative and less than or equal to n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    le = len(a)
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    st, end = 1, 1
    while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
        l += 1
        st += 1
    while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
        r -= 1
        end += 1
    ans = le - max(st, end)
    if a[0] == a[-1]:
        ans = max(0, le - (st + end))
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n, where the last end elements are equal, le is n, l is less than n - end + 1, r is n - end, st is the number of consecutive equal elements at the beginning of a, end is the number of consecutive equal elements at the end of a, ans is max(0, n - (st + end)) if the first element of a is equal to the last element of a. Otherwise, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. stdin contains t - 1 inputs: first an integer n, then a space-separated list of n integers, and ans is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers less than or equal to `n`, `le` is `n`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the first element of `a`, `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is equal to the first element of `a`, `st` is the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the first element of `a`, `end` is the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the last element of `a`, `ans` is `n - max(st, end)` if the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`. Otherwise, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`, and ans is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers less than or equal to `n` with at least two consecutive equal elements, `le` is `n`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `r` is greater than or equal to `l`, `st` is the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the first element of `a`, `end` is `end + k`, `ans` is `n - max(st, end + k)`, and stdin contains no input. If the first and last elements of `a` are equal, then `ans` is `max(0, n - (st + end))`, and ans is printed, ans (where ans is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the list `a` to make all elements in the list distinct, or 0 if the list already has distinct elements)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
