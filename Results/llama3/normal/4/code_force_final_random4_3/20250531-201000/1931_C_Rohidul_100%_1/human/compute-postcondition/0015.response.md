Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n, where the last end elements are equal, le is n, l is less than n - end + 1, r is n - end, st is the number of consecutive equal elements at the beginning of a, end is the number of consecutive equal elements at the end of a, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: first an integer n, then a space-separated list of n integers.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list 'a' has a sequence of equal elements at the end, and the variables 'r' and 'end' have been updated to reflect the length of this sequence. The other variables remain unchanged.
