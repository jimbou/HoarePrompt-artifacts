The code prints the value of `ans`, which is calculated based on the number of elements in the list `a` that are equal to the first element and the last element of `a`. If the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`, `ans` is the difference between the length of `a` and the maximum of the number of elements equal to the first element and the number of elements equal to the last element. Otherwise, `ans` is the maximum of 0 and the difference between the length of `a` and the sum of the number of elements equal to the first element and the number of elements equal to the last element.
Output: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers less than or equal to `n`, `le` is `n`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the first element of `a`, `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is equal to the first element of `a`, `st` is the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the first element of `a`, `end` is the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the last element of `a`, `ans` is `n - max(st, end)` if the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`. Otherwise, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`, and ans is printed**
