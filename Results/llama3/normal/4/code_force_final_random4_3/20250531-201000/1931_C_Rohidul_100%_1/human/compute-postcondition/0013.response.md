According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `r` and `l`, and the elements of list `a`. If `r` is greater than `l` and `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is `n - 3`, `l` is less than `n - 2`, and the last two elements of `a` are equal. For the loop to execute one more time, `r` must be greater than `l`, so `l` must be less than `n - 3`. Also, `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`, so the last three elements of `a` must be equal. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n, where the last three elements are equal, le is n, l is less than n - 3, r is n - 3, st is the number of consecutive equal elements at the beginning of a, end is 3, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: first an integer n, then a space-separated list of n integers**
