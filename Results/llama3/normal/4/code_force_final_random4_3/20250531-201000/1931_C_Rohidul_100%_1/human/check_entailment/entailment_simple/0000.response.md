Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of burles (or operations) required to make all elements of an array equal. The program iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements `a`.

The program then initializes two pointers, `l` and `r`, to the start and end of the array, respectively. It also initializes two variables, `st` and `end`, to keep track of the number of elements at the start and end of the array that are equal to the first and last elements of the array, respectively.

The program then enters a loop that continues until `l` is no longer less than `r` or until the elements at `l` and `l+1` are not equal. During each iteration, `l` is incremented, and `st` is incremented if the elements at `l` and `l+1` are equal. A similar loop is performed for the end of the array, decrementing `r` and incrementing `end` if the elements at `r` and `r-1` are equal.

After the loops, the program calculates the minimum number of burles required to make all elements equal. If the first and last elements of the array are equal, the minimum number of burles is the maximum of 0 and the length of the array minus the sum of `st` and `end`. Otherwise, the minimum number of burles is the length of the array minus the maximum of `st` and `end`.

The program then prints the calculated minimum number of burles for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
