Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers less than or equal to `n`, where the last `end` elements are equal, `le` is `n`, `l` is less than `n - end + 1`, `r` is `n - end`, `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements at the beginning of `a`, `end` is the number of consecutive equal elements at the end of `a`, `ans` is `max(0, n - (st + end))`, stdin contains `t - 1` inputs: first an integer `n`, then a space-separated list of `n` integers. The first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to `max(0, n - (st + end))`, which means it now represents the maximum possible value of `ans` given the current values of `n`, `st`, and `end`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t - 1` inputs.
