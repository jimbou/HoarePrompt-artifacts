Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n, le is n, l is the index of the first element in a that is not equal to the first element in a, r is n - 1, st is the number of consecutive equal elements at the beginning of a, end is 1, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: first an integer n, then a space-separated list of n integers.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: the loop will continue to execute as long as the left pointer (l) is less than the right pointer (r) and the elements at the left and right pointers are equal. Once the loop finishes executing, the left pointer (l) will be at the index of the first element in the list (a) that is not equal to the first element in the list. The number of consecutive equal elements at the beginning of the list (st) will be the number of times the loop executed. The other variables (t, n, le, r, end, and stdin) will remain unchanged.
