Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n, le is n, l is the index of the first element in a that is not equal to the first element of a, r is n - 1, st is the number of elements in a that are equal to the first element of a, end is 1, ans is max(0, n - (st + end)) if the first element of a is equal to the last element of a, otherwise remains the same as the precondition, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: first an integer n, then a space-separated list of n integers, and ans is printed.**

This output state describes the final state of the program after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop continues to increment `l` and `st` as long as `a[l]` is equal to `a[l + 1]`. Once `a[l]` is not equal to `a[l + 1]`, the loop terminates. At this point, `l` points to the first element in `a` that is not equal to the first element of `a`, and `st` is the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the first element of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
