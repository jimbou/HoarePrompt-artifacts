Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n with at least four equal elements at the beginning, le is n, l is 3, r is n - 1, st is 4, end is 1, ans is max(0, n - (st + end)) if the first element of a is equal to the last element of a, otherwise remains the same as the precondition, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: first an integer n, then a space-separated list of n integers, and ans is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `l` and `st` have been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is still dependent on whether the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, and its value is calculated accordingly. The state of `stdin` remains the same, containing `t - 2` inputs.
