Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n with at least one more element equal to a[l+1], le is n, l is l + 2, r is greater than l + 1, st is st + 2, end is unchanged, ans is unchanged, and stdin contains no input.**

The code increments `l` by 1 and `st` by 1. Since `l` was initially `l + 1`, it becomes `l + 2`. Similarly, `st` becomes `st + 2`. No other variables are affected by the code.
