Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n, where the last end elements are equal, le is n, l is less than n - end + 1, r is n - end, st is the number of consecutive equal elements at the beginning of a, end is the number of consecutive equal elements at the end of a, ans is n - max(st, end), stdin contains t - 1 inputs: first an integer n, then a space-separated list of n integers. The first element of a is equal to the last element of a.**
