Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n must be greater than 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n with the first two elements being equal, le is n, l is 1, r is n - 1, st is 2, end is 1, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: first an integer n, then a space-separated list of n integers.**

The code increments the value of `l` by 1, making it 1, and increments the value of `st` by 1, making it 2. No other variables are affected.
