The code prints the value of `ans`, which is determined based on the conditions specified in the initial state.

If the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is calculated as `n - max(st, end)`. Here, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `st` is the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the first element of `a`, and `end` is the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the last element of `a`. So, `ans` is the difference between the length of the list and the maximum of the counts of the first and last elements.

If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is calculated as `max(0, le - (st + end))`. Here, `le` is `n`, which is the length of the list `a`. So, `ans` is the maximum of 0 and the difference between the length of the list and the sum of the counts of the first and last elements.

Output: **n - max(st, end) if the first element of a is not equal to the last element of a, otherwise max(0, n - (st + end))**
