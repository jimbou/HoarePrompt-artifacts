Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers less than or equal to `n`, `le` is `n`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the first element of `a`, `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is equal to the first element of `a`, `st` is the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the first element of `a`, `end` is the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the last element of `a`, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`, stdin contains `t - 3` inputs: first an integer `n`, then a space-separated list of `n` integers, and `ans` is printed. The first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of 0 and `le` minus the sum of `st` and `end`. All other variables remain unchanged. The first element of `a` is still equal to the last element of `a`. The number of inputs in stdin is still `t - 3`.
