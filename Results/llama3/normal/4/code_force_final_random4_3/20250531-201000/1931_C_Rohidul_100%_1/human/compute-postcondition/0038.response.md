Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers less than or equal to `n`, `le` is `n`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the first element of `a`, `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is equal to the first element of `a`, `st` is the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the first element of `a`, `end` is the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the last element of `a`, `ans` is `n - max(st, end)`, stdin contains `t - 3` inputs: first an integer `n`, then a space-separated list of `n` integers, and `ans` is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to `n - max(st, end)`, which means it now holds the difference between the total number of elements in the list `a` and the maximum number of elements that are either equal to the first element or the last element of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t - 3` inputs.
