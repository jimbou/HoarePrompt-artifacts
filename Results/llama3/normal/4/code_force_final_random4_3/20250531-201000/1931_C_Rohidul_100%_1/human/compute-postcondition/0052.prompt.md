Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n, le is n, l is the index of the first element in a that is not equal to the first element of a, r is the index of the last element in a that is equal to the first element of a, st is the number of elements in a that are equal to the first element of a, end is the number of elements in a that are equal to the last element of a, ans is n - max(st, end) if the first element of a is not equal to the last element of a. Otherwise, ans is max(0, le - (st + end)), and ans is printed, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
    l += 1
    st += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n, le is n, l is l + 1, r is unchanged, st is st + 1, end is unchanged, ans is unchanged, and stdin contains no input.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n with at least one more element equal to a[l+1], le is n, l is l + 2, r is greater than l + 1, st is st + 2, end is unchanged, ans is unchanged, and stdin contains no input.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n with at least one more element equal to a[l+2], le is n, l is l + 3, r is greater than l, st is st + 3, end is unchanged, ans is unchanged, and stdin contains no input.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
