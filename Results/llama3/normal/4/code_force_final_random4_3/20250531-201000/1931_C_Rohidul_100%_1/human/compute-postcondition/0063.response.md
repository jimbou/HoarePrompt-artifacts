Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers less than or equal to `n` with at least two consecutive equal elements, `le` is `n`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `r` is greater than or equal to `l`, `st` is the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the first element of `a`, `end` is `end + k`, `ans` is `n - max(st, end + k)`, and stdin contains no input. If the first and last elements of `a` are equal, then `ans` is `max(0, n - (st + end))`.***
