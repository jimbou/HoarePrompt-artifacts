The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers less than or equal to `n`, where the last `end` elements are equal, `le` is `n`, `l` is less than `n - end + 1`, `r` is `n - end`, `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements at the beginning of `a`, `end` is the number of consecutive equal elements at the end of `a`, `ans` is `max(0, n - (st + end))` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`. Otherwise, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. `stdin` contains `t - 1` inputs: first an integer `n`, then a space-separated list of `n` integers, and `ans` is printed**
