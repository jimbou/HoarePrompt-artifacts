According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `r` and `l`, and the list `a`. If `r` is greater than `l` and `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is `n - 2`, `l` is less than `n - 1`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers less than or equal to `n` where the last two elements are equal. For the loop to execute again, `r` must be greater than `l`, so `l` must be less than `n - 2`. Also, `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`, so the last three elements of `a` must be equal. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than or equal to n where the last three elements are equal, le is n, l is less than n - 2, r is n - 2, st is the number of elements in a that are equal to the first element of a, end is 2, ans is max(0, n - (st + end)) if the first element of a is equal to the last element of a, otherwise remains the same as the precondition, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: first an integer n, then a space-separated list of n integers, and ans is printed.**
