Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 non-zero element and all trailing zeros removed, `res` is 1, stdin contains no input, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is being printed, `i` is 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `res` being 1. The other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still being at least 1, `n` being an integer, `a` being a list of integers with at least 1 non-zero element and all trailing zeros removed, stdin containing no input, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed being printed, `i` being 0, and the current value of `a[i]` being 0.
