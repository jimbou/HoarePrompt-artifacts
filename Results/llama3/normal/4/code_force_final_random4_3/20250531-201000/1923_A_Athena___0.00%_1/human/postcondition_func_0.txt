This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the results. It expects the input to contain an integer t, followed by t blocks of two lines each. The first line of each block contains an integer n, and the second line contains a list of n space-separated integers. The function removes leading and trailing zeros from each list, counts the number of zeros in the modified list, and prints the modified list and the count of zeros. It repeats this process for each block of input. After processing all input, the function does not return any value, but the input is consumed, and the results are printed to the console.
