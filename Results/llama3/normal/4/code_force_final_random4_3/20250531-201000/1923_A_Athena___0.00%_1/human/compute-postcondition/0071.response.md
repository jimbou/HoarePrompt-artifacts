The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since the first element of `a` is 0, this means that the first 0 is removed from the list. The value of `i` is equal to `len(a)-1`, so after removing the first element, `i` is now equal to `len(a)-2`. The value of `t` is at least `len(a)` and greater than or equal to its previous value, so it is still at least `len(a)`. The value of `n` is not affected. The list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is still not being printed, and the number of zeros in `a` which is equal to `res` is still being printed. Stdin contains no input.

Output State: **`t` is at least `len(a)`, `n` is an integer, `a` has at least one element and its first element is not 0, `i` is equal to `len(a)-2`, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is not being printed, and the number of zeros in `a` which is equal to `res` is being printed, and stdin contains no input.**
