The variables in the loop head are `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is not empty and its first element is 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with its first element removed (which was 0). So for the loop to be executed one more time the first element of `a` must be 0.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with its first element removed (which was 0) and its first element must be 0, `res` is 0, stdin contains no input**
