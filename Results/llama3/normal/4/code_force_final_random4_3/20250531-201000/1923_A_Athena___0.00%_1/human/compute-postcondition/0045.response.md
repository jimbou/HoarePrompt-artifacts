According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is not empty and its last element is 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, its first element is not 0, and its last element is not 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the last element of `a` must be 0.
State: **`t` is at least `i + 1`, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, its first element is not 0, and its last element is 0, `res` is 0, `i` is no longer equal to the length of `a`, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is no longer being printed, the number of zeros in `a` which is equal to `res` is no longer being printed, and `stdin` contains no input.**
