Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed, stdin contains no input, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is being printed, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `res` is equal to the number of zeros in `a`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` is still at least 1, `n` is still an integer, the list `a` still has all trailing zeros removed, there is still no input in stdin, and the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is still being printed. The loop variable `i` is now equal to the length of the list `a`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements in the list. The variable `res` now holds the total count of zeros in the list `a`.
