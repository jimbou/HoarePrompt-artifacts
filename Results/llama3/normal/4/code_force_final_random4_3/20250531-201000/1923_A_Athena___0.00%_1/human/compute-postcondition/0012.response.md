Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with its last element being an integer, `res` is 0, stdin contains no input.**

The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` was 0, it is removed, and the new last element of `a` is the second last element of the original list. The values of the other variables are not affected.
