Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 non-zero element and all trailing zeros removed, stdin contains no input, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is being printed, `i` is 0. If the current value of `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is 1. Otherwise, no change is made to `res`***
