Output State: **`t` is at least `i + 1`, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, its first element is not 0, and its last element is not 0, `res` is 1, `i` is 0, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is being printed, and the current value of `a[i]` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The list `a` still has at least one element, its first and last elements are not 0, and `t` is still at least `i + 1`. The current index `i` is still 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is still 0. The list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is still being printed.
