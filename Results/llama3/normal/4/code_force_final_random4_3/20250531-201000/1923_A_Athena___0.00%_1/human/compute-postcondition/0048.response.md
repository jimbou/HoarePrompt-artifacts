Output State: **`t` is at least `i + 1`, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, its first element is not 0, and its last element is not 0, `res` is 0, `i` is no longer equal to the length of `a`, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is no longer being printed, the number of zeros in `a` which is equal to `res` is no longer being printed, and `stdin` contains no input.**

In this output state, the last element of list `a` has been removed by the `pop()` function. Since the last element of `a` was 0, the new last element of `a` is not 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
