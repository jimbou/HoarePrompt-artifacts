The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` is 0, it is removed from the list. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with its last element removed, `res` is 0, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: the value of `t` is still at least 1, `n` is still an integer, the list `a` has its last element (which was 0) removed, `res` is still 0, and there is still no input in stdin.
