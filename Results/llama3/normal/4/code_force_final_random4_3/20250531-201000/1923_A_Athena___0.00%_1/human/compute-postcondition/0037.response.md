Output State: **`t` is at least `i + 1`, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers and its first element is an integer, `res` is 0, `i` is no longer equal to the length of `a`, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is no longer being printed, the number of zeros in `a` which is equal to `res` is no longer being printed, and `stdin` contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still at least `i + 1`, `n` is still an integer, `a` is still a non-empty list of integers but its first element is now an integer (not necessarily 0), `res` is still 0, `i` is still not equal to the length of `a`, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is still not being printed, the number of zeros in `a` which is equal to `res` is still not being printed, and `stdin` still contains no input.
