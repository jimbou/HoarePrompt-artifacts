To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of list `a`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `a` is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed, we need to ensure that the list has at least 1 non-zero element.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 non-zero element and all trailing zeros removed, `res` is 0, stdin contains no input, and the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is being printed, `i` is 0**
