Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains 2t lines. Each of the following t blocks of two lines contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) and a list of n space-separated integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) respectively.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = 0
    while a and a[0] == 0:
        a.pop(0)
    while a and a[-1] == 0:
        a.pop()
    print(a)
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] == 0:
            res += 1
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed, stdin contains no input, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is being printed, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `res` is equal to the number of zeros in `a`, and the number of zeros in `a` which is equal to `res` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least `len(a)`, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, its first element is not 0, and its last element is not 0, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is no longer being printed, and the number of zeros in `a` which is equal to `res` is being printed, and `stdin` contains no input, and the number of zeros in `a` which is equal to `res` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least len(a) and greater than or equal to its previous value, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with all leading and trailing zeros removed, `i` is equal to len(a), the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is no longer being printed, and the number of zeros in `a` which is equal to `res` is being printed, and `stdin` contains no input, and the list `a` is being printed. If any element of `a` is 0, then `res` is increased by the number of zeros in `a`, and the number of zeros in `a` which is equal to `res` is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
