Output State: `t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed, `res` is 0, stdin contains no input.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the list `a` has all its leading zeros removed, while the other variables remain unchanged.
