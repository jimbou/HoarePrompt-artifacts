The variables in the loop head are `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is not empty and its first element is 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers with its first element removed. So for the loop to be executed one more time `a` must have had at least two elements and its first element must have been 0. Also, `a` must not be empty.
State: **`t` is at least `i + 1`, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and its first element is 0, `res` is 0, `i` is no longer equal to the length of `a`, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is no longer being printed, the number of zeros in `a` which is equal to `res` is no longer being printed, and `stdin` contains no input.**
