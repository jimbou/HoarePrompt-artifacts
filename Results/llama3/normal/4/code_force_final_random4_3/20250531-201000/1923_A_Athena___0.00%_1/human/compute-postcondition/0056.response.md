Postcondition: ***`t` is at least `i + 1`, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, its first element is not 0, and its last element is not 0, `i` is 0, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is being printed. If the current value of `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is 1. Otherwise, the value of `res` remains unchanged.***
