Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the way it handles the input list `a`. The program removes leading and trailing zeros from the list, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. 

For example, consider the input `5 1 0 1 0 1`. The program will remove the trailing zeros and consider the list as `1 0 1`, which is not the original list. This can lead to incorrect results because the program is not considering the actual positions of the chips and free cells in the original list.

A correct solution would involve iterating through the list and counting the number of zeros between the first and last occurrence of 1, which represents the chips. This can be done by finding the first and last index of 1 in the list and then counting the number of zeros in between. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        first_one = -1
        last_one = -1
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == 1:
                if first_one == -1:
                    first_one = i
                last_one = i
        res = 0
        for i in range(first_one, last_one):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)
```

This program correctly counts the number of zeros between the first and last occurrence of 1 in the list, which represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.
