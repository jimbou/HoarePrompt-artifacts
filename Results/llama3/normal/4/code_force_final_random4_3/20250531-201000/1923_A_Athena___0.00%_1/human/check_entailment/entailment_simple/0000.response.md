Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list of cells `a`.
3. It removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a` by popping elements from the beginning and end of the list while they are zeros. This is done to simplify the problem and focus on the non-zero elements.
4. It then iterates over the remaining elements of `a` and counts the number of zeros. This count represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips to form a single block without any free cells between them.
5. Finally, it prints the count of zeros, which is the minimum number of operations required.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles the edge cases properly. For example, if the input list `a` contains only zeros, the program will correctly output 0, indicating that no operations are required.

Correctness: **True**
