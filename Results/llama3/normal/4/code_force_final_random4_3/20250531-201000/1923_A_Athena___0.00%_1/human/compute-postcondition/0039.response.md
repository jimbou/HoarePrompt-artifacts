Output State: **`t` is at least `i + 1`, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with its first element removed, `res` is 0, `i` is no longer equal to the length of `a`, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is no longer being printed, the number of zeros in `a` which is equal to `res` is no longer being printed, and `stdin` contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still at least `i + 1`, and `n` remains an integer. The list `a` has its first element removed, which was 0. The value of `res` is still 0. The value of `i` is still not equal to the length of `a`. The list `a` with all trailing zeros removed and the number of zeros in `a` which is equal to `res` are still not being printed. There is still no input in `stdin`.
