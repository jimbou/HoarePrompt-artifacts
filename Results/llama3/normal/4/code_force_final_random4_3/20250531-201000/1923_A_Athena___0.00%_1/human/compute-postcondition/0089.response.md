Output State: **`t` is at least len(a) and greater than or equal to its previous value, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements and all leading and trailing zeros removed, `i` is 1, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is no longer being printed, and the number of zeros in `a` which is equal to `res` is being printed, and `stdin` contains no input, and the list `a` is being printed. If the first element of `a` is 0, then `res` is increased by 1, and `res` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` is increased by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` is still being printed, and the number of zeros in `a` is still being printed as `res`. The stdin is still empty, and the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is no longer being printed. The value of `t` is still at least the length of `a` and greater than or equal to its previous value, and `n` is still an integer. The list `a` still has at least two elements and all leading and trailing zeros removed, and `i` is still 1.
