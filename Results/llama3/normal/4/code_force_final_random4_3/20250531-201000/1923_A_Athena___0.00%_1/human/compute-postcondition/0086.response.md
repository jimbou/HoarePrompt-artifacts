Output State: **`t` is at least len(a) and greater than or equal to its previous value, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and all leading and trailing zeros removed, `i` is 0, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is no longer being printed, and the number of zeros in `a` which is equal to `res` is being printed, and `stdin` contains no input, and the list `a` is being printed, and `res` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been incremented by 1, since the current value of `a[i]` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged, and the list `a` is still being printed.
