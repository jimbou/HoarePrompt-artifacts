Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 non-zero elements and all trailing zeros removed, `i` is 2, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is being printed, if the current value of `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is 2. Otherwise, `res` is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is now 2. Otherwise, `res` is now 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
