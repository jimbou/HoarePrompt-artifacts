The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since the first element of `a` is 0, this means that the first 0 is removed from the list.

The value of `i` is equal to the length of `a`, so after removing the first element, `i` is decreased by 1.

The other variables `t`, `n`, and `res` are not affected by this code.

The list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is no longer being printed, and the number of zeros in `a` which is equal to `res` is being printed. This condition is still valid after the code is executed.

The stdin contains no input, which is still the case after the code is executed.

Output State: **`t` is at least `len(a)` and greater than or equal to its previous value, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with its first element removed (which was 0), `i` is equal to `len(a)-1`, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is no longer being printed, and the number of zeros in `a` which is equal to `res` is being printed, and stdin contains no input.**
