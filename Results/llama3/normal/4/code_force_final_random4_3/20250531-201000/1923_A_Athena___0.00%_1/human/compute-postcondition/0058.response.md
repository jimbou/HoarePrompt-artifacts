Output State: **`t` is at least `i + 2`, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, its first element is not 0, and its last element is not 0, `i` is 1, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is being printed. If the current value of `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is 2. Otherwise, the value of `res` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is still being printed. The value of `res` depends on the current value of `a[i]`. If `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is 2. Otherwise, the value of `res` is increased by 1.
