Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with at least one element, `res` is 0, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the first element of list `a` has been removed, so `a` now has at least one element instead of at least two elements. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
