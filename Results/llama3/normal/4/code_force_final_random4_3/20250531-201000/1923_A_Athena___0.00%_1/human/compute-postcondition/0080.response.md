Output State: **`t` is at least `len(a)` and greater than or equal to its previous value, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed and its last element is not 0, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is no longer being printed, and the number of zeros in `a` which is equal to `res` is being printed, and `stdin` contains no input.**

In this output state, the list `a` has been modified by removing its last element, which was 0. The value of `i` is still equal to the length of the modified list `a`. The other variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is still not being printed, and the number of zeros in `a` is still being printed. The `stdin` still contains no input.
