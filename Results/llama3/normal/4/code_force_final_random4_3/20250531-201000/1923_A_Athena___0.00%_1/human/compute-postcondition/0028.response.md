The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `a` has at least 2 non-zero elements and all trailing zeros removed. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 3 non-zero elements and all trailing zeros removed.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 non-zero elements and all trailing zeros removed, stdin contains no input, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is being printed, `i` is 2. If the current value of `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is 1. Otherwise, `res` is 2.**
