Output State: **`t` is at least `i + 1`, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and its first element is the second element of the original list, `res` is 0, `i` is no longer equal to the length of `a`, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is no longer being printed, the number of zeros in `a` which is equal to `res` is no longer being printed, and `stdin` contains no input.**

In this output state, the first element of the list `a` has been removed using the `pop(0)` method. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `a` now has at least one element, and its first element is the second element of the original list. The other conditions, such as `t` being at least `i + 1`, `n` being an integer, `res` being 0, and `i` not being equal to the length of `a`, are still valid. Additionally, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is no longer being printed, and the number of zeros in `a` which is equal to `res` is no longer being printed. The `stdin` still contains no input.
