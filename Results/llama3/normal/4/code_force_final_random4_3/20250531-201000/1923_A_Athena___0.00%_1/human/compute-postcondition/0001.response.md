To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), we can adjust the state of `t` to be at least 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`t` is at least 1**
