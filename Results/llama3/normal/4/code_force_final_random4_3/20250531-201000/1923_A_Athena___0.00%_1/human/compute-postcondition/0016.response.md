Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with at least one element and its last element is not 0, `res` is 0, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains at least 1, and the value of `n` remains an integer. The list `a` is still non-empty, but its last element is no longer 0 because the `pop()` function removed the last element, which was 0. The value of `res` remains 0. The stdin still contains no input.
