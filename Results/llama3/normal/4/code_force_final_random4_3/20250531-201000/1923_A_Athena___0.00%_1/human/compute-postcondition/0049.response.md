Output State: `t` is at least `i + 1`, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, its first element is not 0, and its last element is not 0, `res` is 0, `i` is no longer equal to the length of `a`, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is no longer being printed, the number of zeros in `a` which is equal to `res` is no longer being printed, and `stdin` contains no input.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The list `a` has all trailing zeros removed, and its last element is not 0. The list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is no longer being printed, and the number of zeros in `a` which is equal to `res` is no longer being printed. The other variables `t`, `n`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged.
