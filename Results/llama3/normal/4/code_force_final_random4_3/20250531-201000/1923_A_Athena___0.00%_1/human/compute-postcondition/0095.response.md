The code prints the value of `res`, which is the number of zeros in the list `a`. Since the list `a` has all leading and trailing zeros removed, the value of `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` after removing leading and trailing zeros. If any element of `a` is 0, then `res` is increased by the number of zeros in `a`.

Output: **the number of zeros in the list a after removing leading and trailing zeros**
