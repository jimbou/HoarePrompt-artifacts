Postcondition: ***`t` is at least len(a) and greater than or equal to its previous value, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least three elements and all leading and trailing zeros removed, `i` is 2, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is no longer being printed, and the number of zeros in `a` which is equal to `res` is being printed, and `stdin` contains no input, and the list `a` is being printed. If the first element of `a` is 0, then `res` is increased by 1. If the second element of `a` is 0, then `res` is increased by 1. If the third element of `a` is 0, then `res` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
