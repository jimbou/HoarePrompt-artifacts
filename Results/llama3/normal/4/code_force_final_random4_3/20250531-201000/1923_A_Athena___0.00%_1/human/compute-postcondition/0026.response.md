Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 non-zero elements and all trailing zeros removed, `res` is either 2 or 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains no input, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is being printed**

In this output state, the value of `res` is either 2 or 1 because the code increments `res` by 1, and initially, `res` is 1 if the current value of `a[i]` is 0, otherwise, no change is made to `res`. The other variables remain unchanged.
