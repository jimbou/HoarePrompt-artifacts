The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains t+2t lines. The first line contains one integer t (1 <= t <= 1000). Since the first line is consumed by the input, the remaining lines are 2t lines. Each of the following t blocks of two lines contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) and a list of n space-separated integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) respectively. The value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains 2t lines. Each of the following t blocks of two lines contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) and a list of n space-separated integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) respectively.**
