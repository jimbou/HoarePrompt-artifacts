To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `a`. If `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is at least `i + 1`, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, its first element is not 0, and its last element is not 0, `res` is 0, `i` is no longer equal to the length of `a`, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is no longer being printed, the number of zeros in `a` which is equal to `res` is no longer being printed, and `stdin` contains no input, and the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is being printed. However, these states do not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust `a` to have at least 1 element and `i` to be 0.

State: **`t` is at least `i + 1`, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, its first element is not 0, and its last element is not 0, `res` is 0, `i` is 0, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is being printed**
