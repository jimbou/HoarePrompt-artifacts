The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since the first element of `a` is 0, this element is removed. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with its first element removed (which was 0), `res` is 0, stdin contains no input**
