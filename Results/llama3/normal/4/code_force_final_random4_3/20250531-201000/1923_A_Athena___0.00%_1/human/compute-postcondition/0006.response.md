Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with its first two elements removed (which were 0) and its first element must be 0, `res` is 0, stdin contains no input**

The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element of the list `a`, which was 0. Since the first element of `a` was 0, the new first element of `a` is also 0. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains no input.
