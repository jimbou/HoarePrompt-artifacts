Output State: **`t` is at least `i + 1`, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, its first element is not 0, and its last element is not 0, `res` is 0, `i` is no longer equal to the length of `a`, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is no longer being printed, the number of zeros in `a` which is equal to `res` is no longer being printed, and `stdin` contains no input.**

The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` was 0, it is now removed. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `a` is still non-empty, and its first element is still not 0. The value of `i` is still not equal to the length of `a`, and the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is still not being printed. The number of zeros in `a` is still equal to `res`, which is 0. The stdin still contains no input.
