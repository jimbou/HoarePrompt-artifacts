Output State: `t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed, `res` is 0, stdin contains no input.

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the list `a` will have all its leading zeros removed, and the other variables will remain unchanged.
