Output State: **`t` is at least `len(a)` and greater than or equal to its previous value, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed and its last element is not 0, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is no longer being printed, and the number of zeros in `a` which is equal to `res` is being printed, and `stdin` contains no input.**

The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` was 0, the new last element of `a` is not 0. The length of `a` has decreased by 1, so `i` is still equal to `len(a)`. The other variables are not affected.
