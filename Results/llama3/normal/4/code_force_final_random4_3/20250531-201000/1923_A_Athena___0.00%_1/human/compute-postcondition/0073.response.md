The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since the first element of `a` is 0, this means that the first 0 is removed from `a`. The value of `i` is equal to `len(a)-2`, so after removing the first element, `i` is now equal to `len(a)-1`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is at least `len(a)`, `n` is an integer, `a` has at least one element and its first element is not 0, `i` is equal to `len(a)-1`, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is not being printed, and the number of zeros in `a` which is equal to `res` is being printed, and stdin contains no input.**
