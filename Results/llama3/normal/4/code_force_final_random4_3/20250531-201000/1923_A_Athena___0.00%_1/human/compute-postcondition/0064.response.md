The code prints the number of zeros in the list `a`, which is stored in the variable `res`. Since the list `a` has been modified to remove all trailing zeros, the value of `res` represents the count of zeros in the original list `a`, excluding the trailing zeros.

Output: **the number of zeros in the list a (excluding trailing zeros)**
