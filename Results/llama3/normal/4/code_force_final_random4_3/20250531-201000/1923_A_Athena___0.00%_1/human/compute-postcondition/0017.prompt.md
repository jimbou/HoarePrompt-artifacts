Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed, `res` is 0, stdin contains no input.

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the list `a` will have all its leading zeros removed, and the other variables will remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while a and a[-1] == 0:
    a.pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with its last element being an integer, `res` is 0, stdin contains no input.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with its last element removed, `res` is 0, stdin contains no input.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with at least one element and its last element is not 0, `res` is 0, stdin contains no input.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
