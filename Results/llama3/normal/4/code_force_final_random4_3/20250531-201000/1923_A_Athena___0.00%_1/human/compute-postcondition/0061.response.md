Output State: **`t` is at least `i + 3`, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, its first element is not 0, and its last element is not 0, `i` is 2, the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is being printed. If the current value of `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is 3. Otherwise, the value of `res` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still at least `i + 3`, `n` remains an integer, and `a` is still a list of integers with at least 3 elements, where the first and last elements are not 0. The value of `i` is still 2. The list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is still being printed. The value of `res` has been increased by 1. If `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is now 3; otherwise, `res` has been increased by 1 from its previous value.
