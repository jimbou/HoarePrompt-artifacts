Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^9) and is at least 1, `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^9), `a` is an integer (1 <= a <= 10^9), `b` is an integer (1 <= b <= 10^9), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case**.

In this output state, the value of `t` remains the same as it was not affected by the code. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the three integers from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one test case because one test case has been read and processed.
