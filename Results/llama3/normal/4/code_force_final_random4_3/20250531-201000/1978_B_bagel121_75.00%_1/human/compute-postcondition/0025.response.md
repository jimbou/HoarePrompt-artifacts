The code prints the sum of the arithmetic series from `b - k + 1` to `b` (where `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`) plus the product of `n - k` and `a`. Where `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer equal to the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is an integer equal to the sum of the arithmetic series from `b - k + 1` to `b`, and `p2` is an integer equal to the product of `n - k` and `a`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.
Output: **`t` is an integer (2 <= t <= 10^9), `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^9), `a` is an integer (1 <= a <= 10^9), `b` is an integer (1 <= b <= 10^9), `k` is an integer equal to the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is an integer equal to the sum of the arithmetic series from `b - k + 1` to `b`, `p2` is an integer equal to the product of `n - k` and `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, and this is printed: `ans + p2`**
