Output State: **`t` is an integer (2 <= t <= 10^9), `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^9), `a` is an integer (1 <= a <= 10^9), `b` is an integer (1 <= b <= 10^9), stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

The code accepts three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The values of `t` are not affected. Since stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, after accepting three integers, it now contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.
