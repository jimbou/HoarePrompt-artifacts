Output State: **t is an integer (2 <= t <= 10^9), n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^9), a is an integer (1 <= a <= 10^9), b is an integer (1 <= b <= 10^9), k is an integer equal to the minimum of b - a + 1 and n, ans is an integer equal to the sum of the arithmetic series from b - k + 1 to b, p2 is an integer equal to the product of n - k and a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `k` is determined by the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, which means it will be the smaller of the two values. The value of `ans` is calculated as the sum of the arithmetic series from `b - k + 1` to `b`, which is a sequence of numbers with a common difference of 1. The value of `p2` is calculated as the product of `n - k` and `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.
