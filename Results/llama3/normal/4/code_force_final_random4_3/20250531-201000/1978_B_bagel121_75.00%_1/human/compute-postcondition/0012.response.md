Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^9) and is at least 1, `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^9), `a` is an integer (1 <= a <= 10^9), `b` is an integer (1 <= b <= 10^9), stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` have been updated to the values read from the input, which are integers between 1 and 10^9. The value of `t` is still an integer between 1 and 10^9, but it is now at least 1 because one test case has been processed. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus three test cases because one test case has been read and processed.
