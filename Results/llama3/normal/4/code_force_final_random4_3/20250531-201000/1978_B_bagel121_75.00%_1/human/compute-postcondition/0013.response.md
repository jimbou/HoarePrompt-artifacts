Based on the precondition, the code `print(n * a)` will print the product of the values of `n` and `a`.

Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and `a` is also an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), the product `n * a` will be an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive).

Therefore, the output will be the product of the specific values of `n` and `a` that are present in the program's state at the time of execution.

Output: **n * a (where n and a are integers between 1 and 10^9)**
