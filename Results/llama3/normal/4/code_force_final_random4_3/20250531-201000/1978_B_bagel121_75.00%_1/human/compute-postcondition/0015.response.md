Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^9) and is at least 1, n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^9), a is an integer (1 <= a <= 10^9), b is an integer (1 <= b <= 10^9), k is an integer equal to the minimum of b - a + 1 and n, ans is an integer equal to the sum of the arithmetic series from b - k + 1 to b, p2 is an integer equal to (n - k) times a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The variable `k` is assigned the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, which means it will be the smaller of the two values. The variable `ans` is calculated as the sum of the arithmetic series from `b - k + 1` to `b`, which is a sum of consecutive integers. The variable `p2` is calculated as `(n - k)` times `a`, which is a product of two integers. The state of `stdin` remains the same as it is not affected by the code.
