The only variable in the loop head is variable  `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `t` must be at least 2.
State: **`t` is an integer (2 <= t <= 10^9), `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^9), `a` is an integer (1 <= a <= 10^9), `b` is an integer (1 <= b <= 10^9), stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**
