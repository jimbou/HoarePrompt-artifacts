Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^9) and is at least 1, n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^9), a is an integer (1 <= a <= 10^9), b is an integer (1 <= b <= 10^9), k is an integer equal to the minimum of b - a + 1 and n, ans is an integer equal to the sum of the arithmetic series from b - k + 1 to b with k terms, p2 is an integer equal to (n - k) times a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, a is less than b**
