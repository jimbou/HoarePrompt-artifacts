Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer (2 <= t <= 10^9), `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^9), `a` is an integer (1 <= a <= 10^9), `b` is an integer (1 <= b <= 10^9), stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If `a` >= `b`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. Otherwise, `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is the sum of the arithmetic series from `b - k + 1` to `b`, `p2` is the product of `n - k` and `a`, and `ans + p2` is printed.***
