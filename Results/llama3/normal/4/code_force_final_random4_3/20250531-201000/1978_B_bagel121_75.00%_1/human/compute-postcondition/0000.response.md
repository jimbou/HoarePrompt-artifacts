The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing three integers n, a, and b. Since the code only reads one integer, the remaining test cases are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^9), stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9)**
