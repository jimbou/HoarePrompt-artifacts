Postcondition: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^9) and is at least 1, `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^9), `a` is an integer (1 <= a <= 10^9), `b` is an integer (1 <= b <= 10^9), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed, which is equal to `n * a`. If `a` is less than `b`, the sum of the arithmetic series from `b - k + 1` to `b` with `k` terms and `(n - k) * a` is printed, where `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.**
