Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^9) and is at least 1, `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^9), `a` is an integer (1 <= a <= 10^9), `b` is an integer (1 <= b <= 10^9), stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If `a` >= `b`, the product of `n` and `a` is being printed. Otherwise, `k` is an integer equal to the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is an integer equal to the sum of the arithmetic series from `b - k + 1` to `b`, `p2` is an integer equal to `(n - k)` times `a`, and the sum of `ans` and `p2` is being printed.***
