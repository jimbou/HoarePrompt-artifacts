Reasoning:

The given program is designed to read a series of pairs of integers from standard input, compare each pair, and print the pair in the order where the larger number comes first. The program correctly implements this functionality.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` from standard input and stores it in the variable `x`.
2. The program then enters a loop that runs `t` times. In each iteration, it reads a pair of integers `x` and `y` from standard input and stores them in the variables `x` and `y`.
3. The program then compares the values of `x` and `y` using an if-else statement. If `x` is greater than `y`, it prints the values of `x` and `y` in that order. Otherwise, it prints the values of `y` and `x` in that order.
4. The program repeats steps 2-3 until it has processed all `t` pairs of integers.

The program's logic is correct, and it produces the expected output for the given input. The program also handles the edge cases correctly, such as when `x` and `y` are equal.

Correctness: **True**
