The `print(y, x)` statement will print the values of `y` and `x` separated by a space.

Since `x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive, and the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values of `x` and `y`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the values of `y` and `x` in the order `y` followed by `x`.

Output: **y (where y is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive), x (where x is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive)**
