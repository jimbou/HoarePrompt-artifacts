The code prints the values of `y` and `x` which are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive, where `x` is less than or equal to `y`. Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `x` and `y`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the values of `y` and `x` in that order.
Output: **y (where y is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive), x (where x is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive and x is less than or equal to y)**
