Output: **`x` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `y` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9). The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`, and this is printed: the current values of x and y which are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive, where x is greater than y**
