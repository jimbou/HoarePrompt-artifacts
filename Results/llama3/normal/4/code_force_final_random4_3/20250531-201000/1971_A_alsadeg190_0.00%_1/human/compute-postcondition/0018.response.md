Output State: **`x` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `y` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9).**

In this output state, the values of `x` and `y` have been updated to the first two integers from the input, which are between 0 and 9 inclusive. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. The stdin now contains t-4 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9), since one line has been consumed by the input operation.
