Reasoning:

The program is designed to read a series of pairs of integers, compare each pair, and print the pair in the order where the larger number comes first. However, according to the problem description, the program should output the minimum of x and y followed by the maximum of x and y.

The program's logic is incorrect because it prints the larger number first, instead of the smaller number. The correct logic should be to print the smaller number first, followed by the larger number.

Correctness: **False**
