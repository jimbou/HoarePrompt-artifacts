Output State: **`x` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `y` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9)**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to be an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, which is the first integer from the input. The value of `y` has been updated to be an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, which is the second integer from the input. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The stdin now contains t-2 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9), since one line has been consumed by the input operation.
