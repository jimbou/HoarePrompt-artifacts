To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `x`. The loop will execute if `x` is at least 1. Since `x` is already an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, we can conclude that `x` must be greater than 0. Additionally, before the loop starts, `i` is not yet defined, so we can set it to 0, which is the starting value for the range function.

State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9)**
