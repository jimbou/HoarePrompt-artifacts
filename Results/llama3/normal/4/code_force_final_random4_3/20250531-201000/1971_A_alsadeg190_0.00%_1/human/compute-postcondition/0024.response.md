Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive, `i` is `x-1`, stdin contains 0 lines. If `x` is greater than `y`, the values of `x` and `y` are printed. Otherwise, the values of `y` and `x` are printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `i` will be one less than the initial value of `x`, and the stdin will be empty since all lines have been processed. The values of `x` and `y` will be the last pair of integers read from stdin. If `x` is greater than `y`, they will be printed in the order `x, y`; otherwise, they will be printed in the order `y, x`.
