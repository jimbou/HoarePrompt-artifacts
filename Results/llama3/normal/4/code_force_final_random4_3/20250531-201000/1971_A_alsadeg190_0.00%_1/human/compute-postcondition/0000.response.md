Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9).**

In this output state, the value of `x` is assigned the integer from the input, which is between 1 and 100 inclusive. The stdin now contains t-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9), since one line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
