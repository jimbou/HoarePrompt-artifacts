Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9). If `x` is greater than `y`, the values of `x` and `y` are printed. Otherwise, the value of `y` and `x` are printed, where `y` and `x` are the second and first integers in the first line of stdin respectively.***
