The code prints the values of `x` and `y`, which are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive. However, the exact values of `x` and `y` are not specified in the initial state, as they are read from the standard input (`stdin`) and can vary.

Output: **x (an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive), y (an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive)**
