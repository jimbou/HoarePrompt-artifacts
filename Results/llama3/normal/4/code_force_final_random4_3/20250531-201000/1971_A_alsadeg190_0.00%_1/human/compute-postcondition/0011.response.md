Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9)**

Explanation: The code reads two space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y`, respectively. Since the input contains t-2 lines, each containing two space-separated integers, after reading one line, there are t-3 lines left in the input. The values of `i` and the range of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
