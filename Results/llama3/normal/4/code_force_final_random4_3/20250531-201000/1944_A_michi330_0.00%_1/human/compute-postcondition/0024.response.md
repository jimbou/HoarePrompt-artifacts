Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^3), `i` is `t`, `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 100), `k` is an integer (0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2), stdin is empty. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`, the number 1 is printed `t` times. Otherwise, the value of `n-1` is printed `t` times.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the value of `t`, which is the number of iterations. The variables `n` and `k` will have taken on the values of the last pair of integers read from the input. The input stream will be empty, as all lines have been read. The output will consist of either the number 1 printed `t` times, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`, or the value of `n-1` printed `t` times, otherwise.
