The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^3). For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer (2 <= t <= 10^3), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 100), `k` is an integer (0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2), stdin contains `t-2` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2). If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, `n - 1` is printed.**
