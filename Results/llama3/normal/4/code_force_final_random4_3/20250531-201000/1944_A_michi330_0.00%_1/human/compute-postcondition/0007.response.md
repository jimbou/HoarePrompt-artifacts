The code prints the value of `n - 1`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `k` is an integer between 0 and `n*(n-1)/2` (inclusive), and `k` is less than `n - 1`. Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `n - 1`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `n - 1`.
Output: **n - 1 (where n is an integer between 1 and 100)**
