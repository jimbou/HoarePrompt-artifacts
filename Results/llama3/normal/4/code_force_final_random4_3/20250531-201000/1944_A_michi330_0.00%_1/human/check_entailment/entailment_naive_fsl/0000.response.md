Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when k is less than n-1. In this case, the program prints n-1, but the correct answer is n. This is because if k is less than n-1, Dominater cannot destroy enough bridges to isolate any island, so Everule can still visit all n islands.

For example, if n = 4 and k = 2, the program prints 3, but the correct answer is 4. This is because Dominater can destroy at most 2 bridges, but there are 6 bridges in total, so Everule can still visit all 4 islands.
