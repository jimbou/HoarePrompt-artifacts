The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `t` to be the integer from the input. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2). After the code is executed, the value of `t` is assigned to be the integer from the input, and the stdin now contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^3), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2)**
