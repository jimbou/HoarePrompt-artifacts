Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer (2 <= t <= 10^3), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 100), `k` is an integer (0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2), stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2). If `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`, the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `n-1` is printed.***
