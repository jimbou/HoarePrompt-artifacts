Based on the initial state, the code `print(n - 1)` will print the value of `n` minus 1.

The variable `n` is described as an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), but its exact value is not specified. However, since the code is executed after reading `t-3` lines from stdin, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, it is likely that the value of `n` is the one read from the last line of stdin.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `n` minus 1, where `n` is the value read from the last line of stdin.

Output: **n-1 (where n is the value read from the last line of stdin)**
