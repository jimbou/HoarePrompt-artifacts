To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^3), which already ensures that the loop will execute. However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect its initial value.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^3), `i` is 0, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2)**
