Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^3), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 100), `k` is an integer (0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2), stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2)**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the two integers from the first line of the input, which are within the specified ranges. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines, each with two integers `n` and `k`, as one line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
