Output State: **`t` is an integer (2 <= t <= 10^3), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 100), `k` is an integer (0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2), stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2).**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the new values read from the input, which are integers within the specified ranges. The stdin now contains `t-3` lines, each with two integers `n` and `k`, because one line has been read and processed.
