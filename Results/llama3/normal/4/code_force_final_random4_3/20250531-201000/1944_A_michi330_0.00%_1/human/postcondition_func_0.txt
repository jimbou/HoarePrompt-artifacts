The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, n and k. It then prints the minimum number of operations required to make all pairs of nodes in a graph of n nodes connected, given that k connections already exist. If k is greater than or equal to n-1, it prints 1, indicating that only one more connection is needed. Otherwise, it prints n-1, indicating that n-1 more connections are needed. The function repeats this process for each test case.
