The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer (2 <= t <= 10^3). For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`t` is an integer (2 <= t <= 10^3), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 100), `k` is an integer (0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2), stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2). If `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`, the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `n-1` is printed.**
