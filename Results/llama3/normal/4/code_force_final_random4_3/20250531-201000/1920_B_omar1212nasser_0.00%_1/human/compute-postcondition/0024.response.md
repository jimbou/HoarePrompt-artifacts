Functionality: **This function calculates and returns the maximum possible sum of a list of non-negative integers after a series of removals and negations. It takes three parameters: a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, and two non-negative integers representing the number of removals and negations to be performed. The function returns the maximum sum after the removals and negations, or 0 if the removals and negations are 6 and 3, respectively.**
