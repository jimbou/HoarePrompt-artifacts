To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `removals`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `removals`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `removals` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `removals` is already greater than 1, it remains the same.

State: **`removals` is greater than 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, the pair (`removals`, `negatives`) is not equal to (6, 3), `pos` is a list containing three elements where the first element is the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the list `elements` minus `elements[-1]`, the second element is `s - 2 * n`, and the third element is `s - 2 * n`, `i` is 3, `s` is decreased by `elements[-2]`, and `n` is either increased by `elements[-(negatives + 4)] - elements[-2]` or assigned the value 0 if an `IndexError` occurs.**
