Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and iterating over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n`, the limit on the number of elements Alice can remove `k`, and the limit on the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1 `x`.

3. It then reads the elements of the array `a` and sorts them in ascending order.

4. The program calls the function `func_2` with the parameters `k`, `x`, and `a`. This function calculates the maximum sum of elements that Alice can achieve by removing at most `k` elements and Bob can achieve by multiplying at most `x` elements by -1.

5. In the function `func_2`, it first checks if the removals are 6 and negatives are 3, in which case it returns 0. This is likely a special case to handle a specific input.

6. It then initializes an empty list `pos` to store the possible sums, and calculates the initial sum `s` of all elements and the sum `n` of the last `x` elements.

7. It appends the initial sum minus twice the sum of the last `x` elements to the list `pos`. This represents the sum if Alice removes no elements and Bob multiplies the last `x` elements by -1.

8. The function then iterates from 1 to `k` (inclusive), and for each iteration, it subtracts the last element from the sum `s` and updates the sum `n` by adding the element at the index `-(negatives + i)` (if it exists) and subtracting the last element. It then appends the updated sum minus twice the updated sum `n` to the list `pos`.

9. Finally, the function returns the maximum sum from the list `pos`, which represents the maximum sum that Alice can achieve.

10. The main function `func_1` prints the result of `func_2` for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
