The `IndexError` might be triggered at `n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if `negatives + i` is greater than or equal to the length of the list `elements`. If `negatives + i` is within the bounds of the list, the value of `n` is increased by the difference between the element at index `-(negatives + i)` and the element at index `-i`. Otherwise, the `IndexError` is raised, and the value of `n` is assigned 0.

Therefore, the output state is: `removals` is greater than 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, the pair (`removals`, `negatives`) is not equal to (6, 3), `pos` is a list containing three elements where the first element is the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the list `elements` minus `elements[-1]`, the second element is `s - 2 * n`, and the third element is `s - 2 * n`, `i` is 3, `s` is decreased by `elements[-3]`, and `n` is either increased by `elements[-(negatives + 3)] - elements[-3]` if `negatives + i` is within the bounds of the list, or assigned the value 0 if an `IndexError` occurs.
