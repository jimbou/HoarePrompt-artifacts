The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and removals, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `removals`. If `i` is less than `removals`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `removals` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `removals` must be greater than 1.
State: **`removals` is greater than 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, the pair (`removals`, `negatives`) is not equal to (6, 3), `pos` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the list `elements` minus `elements[-1]`, and the second element is `s - 2 * n`, `i` is 2, `s` is decreased by `elements[-1]`, and `n` is either increased by `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` or assigned the value 0 if an `IndexError` occurs.**
