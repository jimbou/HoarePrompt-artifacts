The function takes a list of integers, a non-negative integer k, and a non-negative integer x as input, sorts the list in ascending order, and then calls another function func_2 with k, x, and the sorted list as arguments. The result of func_2 is stored in the variable product and then printed. The function iterates this process for a number of test cases specified by the user.
