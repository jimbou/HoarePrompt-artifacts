Output State: **`removals` is greater than 0, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, the pair (`removals`, `negatives`) is not equal to (6, 3), `pos` is a list containing one element which is the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the list `elements` minus `elements[-1]`, `i` is 1, `s` is decreased by `elements[-1]`, `n` is increased by `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]`**
