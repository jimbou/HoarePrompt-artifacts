To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `removals`. The loop will execute if `removals` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `removals` to be greater than 0, and `i` should be 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`removals` is greater than 0, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, the pair (`removals`, `negatives`) is not equal to (6, 3), `pos` is a list containing one element which is the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the list `elements`, `i` is 1**
