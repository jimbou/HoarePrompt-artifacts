Output State: **`removals` is greater than 0, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, the pair (`removals`, `negatives`) is not equal to (6, 3), `pos` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the list `elements` minus `elements[-1]`, and the second element is `s - 2 * n`, `i` is 1, `s` is decreased by `elements[-1]`, and `n` is either increased by `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` or assigned the value 0 if an `IndexError` occurs.**

In this output state, the value of `pos` has been updated by appending a new element, which is the result of the expression `s - 2 * n`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
