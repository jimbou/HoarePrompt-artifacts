Output State: **`removals` is greater than 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, the pair (`removals`, `negatives`) is not equal to (6, 3), `pos` is a list containing three elements where the first element is the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the list `elements` minus `elements[-1]`, the second element is `s - 2 * n`, and the third element is `s - 2 * n`, `i` is 2, `s` is decreased by `elements[-2]`, and `n` is either increased by `elements[-(negatives + 4)] - elements[-2]` or assigned the value 0 if an `IndexError` occurs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of removals is still greater than 1, the number of negatives is still a non-negative integer, and the list of elements is still sorted in ascending order. The pair of removals and negatives is still not equal to (6, 3). The list `pos` now contains three elements: the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements minus the last element, the value of `s` minus twice `n`, and again the value of `s` minus twice `n`. The value of `i` is still 2, the value of `s` is decreased by the second last element, and the value of `n` is either increased by the difference between the element at index `negatives + 4` and the second last element, or assigned the value 0 if an `IndexError` occurs.
