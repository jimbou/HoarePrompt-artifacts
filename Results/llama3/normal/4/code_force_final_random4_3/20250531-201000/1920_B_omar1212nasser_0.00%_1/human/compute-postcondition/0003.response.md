Output State: **removals is a non-negative integer, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, the pair (removals, negatives) is not equal to (6, 3), pos is a list containing one element which is the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last negatives elements in the list elements.**

In this output state, the values of `removals` and `negatives` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The list `elements` also remains the same, as the code only reads from it but does not modify it. The pair `(removals, negatives)` is still not equal to `(6, 3)`, as this condition is not affected by the code. The new list `pos` is created and contains one element, which is calculated as the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`.
