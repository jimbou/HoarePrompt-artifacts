Output State: **`removals` is greater than 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, the pair (`removals`, `negatives`) is not equal to (6, 3), `pos` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the list `elements` minus `elements[-1]`, and the second element is `s - 2 * n`, `i` is 2, `s` is decreased by `elements[-2]`, and `n` is either increased by `elements[-(negatives + 4)] - elements[-2]` or assigned the value 0 if an `IndexError` occurs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of removals is still greater than 1, the number of negatives is still a non-negative integer, the list of elements is still sorted in ascending order and contains non-negative integers, and the pair of removals and negatives is still not equal to (6, 3). The list `pos` still contains two elements, where the first element is the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the list `elements` minus the last element in `elements`, and the second element is `s` minus twice `n`. The value of `i` is still 2, `s` is still decreased by the second last element in `elements`, and `n` is either increased by the difference between the element at index `-(negatives + 4)` and the second last element in `elements`, or assigned the value 0 if an `IndexError` occurs.
