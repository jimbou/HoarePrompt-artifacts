Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n` with a different first character than `b`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `k` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
