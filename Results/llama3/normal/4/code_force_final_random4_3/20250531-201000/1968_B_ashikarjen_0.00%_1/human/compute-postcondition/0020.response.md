Output State: **`j` is less than or equal to `m`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` where `b[j-1]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `k` is 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-1` test cases**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, so it is now less than or equal to `m`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]` is now `b[j-1]` is not equal to `a[i]` because `j` has been incremented.
