Output State: **j is equal to m or b[j] is equal to a[i], n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length m, k is 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that either the index `j` has reached the end of string `b` (i.e., `j` is equal to `m`), or the character at the current index `j` in string `b` is equal to the character at index `i` in string `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
