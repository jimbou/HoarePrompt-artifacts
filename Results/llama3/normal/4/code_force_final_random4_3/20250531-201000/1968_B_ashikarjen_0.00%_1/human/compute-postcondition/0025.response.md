Output State: **j is equal to m or b[j] is equal to a[i], n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length m, k is 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, j is not less than m and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables j, n, m, a, b, k, and i remain unchanged. The stdin now contains t-2 test cases because we have broken out of the loop or if statement that was directly inside the loop that was reading the test cases from stdin. The condition j is equal to m or b[j] is equal to a[i] is still valid. We have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.
