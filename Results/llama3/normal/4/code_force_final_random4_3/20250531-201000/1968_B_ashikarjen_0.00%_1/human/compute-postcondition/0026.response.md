Postcondition: ***j is equal to m or b[j] is equal to a[i], n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length m. If j is less than m, then k is 2 and i is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If j is not less than m, then k is 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
