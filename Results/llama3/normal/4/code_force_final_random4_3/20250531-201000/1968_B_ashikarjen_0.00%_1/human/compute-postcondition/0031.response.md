Output State: **`j` is less than or equal to `m`, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` where `b[j-1]` is different from `a[i-1]`, `k` is 2, `i` is 2, stdin contains `t-1` test cases**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, so it is now less than or equal to `m`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition `b[j]` is different from `a[i]` is no longer valid because `j` has been incremented, but the condition `b[j-1]` is different from `a[i-1]` is still valid.
