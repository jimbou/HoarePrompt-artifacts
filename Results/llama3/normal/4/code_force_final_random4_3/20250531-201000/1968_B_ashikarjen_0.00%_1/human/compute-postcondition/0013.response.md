Postcondition: ***j is either less than m or equal to m, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length m, k is 1 if j is less than m, otherwise k is 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases if j is less than m, otherwise stdin contains t-2 test cases and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
