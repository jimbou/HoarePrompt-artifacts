The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is strictly less than `m`, so the new value of `j` is either equal to `m` or still strictly less than `m`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases.

Output State: **`j` is either equal to `m` or strictly less than `m`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `k` is 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-1` test cases**
