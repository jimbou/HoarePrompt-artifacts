Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length m, k is 0, j is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
        j += 1
    if j < m:
        k += 1
        j += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *j is either less than m or equal to m, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length m, k is 1 if j is less than m, otherwise k is 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases if j is less than m, otherwise stdin contains t-2 test cases and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *j is equal to m or b[j] is equal to a[i], n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length m. If j is less than m, then k is 2 and i is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If j is not less than m, then k is 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *j is equal to m or b[j] is equal to a[i], n is an integer greater than 2, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length m, k is either 2 or 3, i is 2, and stdin contains either t-1 or t-2 test cases, depending on whether j is less than m or not. If j is less than m, k is 3, otherwise, k is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
