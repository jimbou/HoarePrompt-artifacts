Postcondition: ***j is equal to m or b[j] is equal to a[i], n is an integer greater than 2, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length m, k is either 2 or 3, i is 2, and stdin contains either t-1 or t-2 test cases, depending on whether j is less than m or not. If j is less than m, k is 3, otherwise, k is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
