Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers representing the scores of three players. It then calculates and prints the maximum possible score that can be achieved by combining the scores of the players, considering the constraint that the sum of the scores must be even. If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the average of the first two scores plus half of the third score if the third score is less than or equal to the sum of the first two scores; otherwise, it prints the average of the first two scores.**
