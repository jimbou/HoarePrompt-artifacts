The code accepts a space-separated list of integers from the input and assigns them to the list `v`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, so after accepting one test case, there are still multiple test cases left in the stdin. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `v` is a list of three integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30), stdin contains multiple test cases**
