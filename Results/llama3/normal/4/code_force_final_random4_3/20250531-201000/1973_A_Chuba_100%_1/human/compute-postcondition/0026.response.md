Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, v is a list of three integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 test case has been processed. If the sum of the elements of v is odd, -1 is printed. Otherwise, if the third element of v is less than or equal to the sum of the first two elements, the average of the first two elements of v plus half of the third element of v is printed. Otherwise, the average of the first two elements of v is printed.***
