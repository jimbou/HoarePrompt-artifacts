Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `v` is a list of three integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30), `result` is the integer part of the average of the three integers in `v`, rounded down, stdin contains multiple test cases**

In this output state, the value of `result` is calculated by adding the three integers in `v`, subtracting the maximum of 0 and the difference between the third integer and the sum of the first two integers, and then dividing by 2. The `//` operator is used for integer division, which rounds down to the nearest whole number. The values of `t`, `_`, and `v` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases.
