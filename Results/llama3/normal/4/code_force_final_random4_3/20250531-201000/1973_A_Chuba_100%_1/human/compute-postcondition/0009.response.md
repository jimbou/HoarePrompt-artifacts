Output: **`t` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `v` is a list of three integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30), `result` is the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of the three integers in the list `v` even, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, and the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of the three integers in the list `v` even is printed**
