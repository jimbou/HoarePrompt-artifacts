Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `v` is a list of three integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30), stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If the sum of the elements in `v` is an odd number, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of the three integers in the list `v` even is printed.***
