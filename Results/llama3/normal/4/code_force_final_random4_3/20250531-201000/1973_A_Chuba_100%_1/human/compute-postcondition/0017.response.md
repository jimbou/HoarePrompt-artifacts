Output: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `v` is a list of three integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30), `result` is the integer part of the average of the three integers in `v`, rounded down, stdin contains multiple test cases, and the result which is the integer part of the average of the three integers in `v` is being printed**
