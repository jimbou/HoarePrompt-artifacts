Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `v` is a list of three integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30), stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**.

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `_` also remains 0 as it is not modified. The variable `v` is assigned a list of three integers from the input, which are the scores of the three players in a test case. The stdin now contains one less test case than before, as one test case has been read and processed.
