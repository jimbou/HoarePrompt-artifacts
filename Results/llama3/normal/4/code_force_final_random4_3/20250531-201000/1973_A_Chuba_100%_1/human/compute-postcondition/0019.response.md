To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 2. The value of `t` remains the same, but since `_` is now 2, `t` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `v` is a list of three integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30), stdin contains multiple test cases.**
