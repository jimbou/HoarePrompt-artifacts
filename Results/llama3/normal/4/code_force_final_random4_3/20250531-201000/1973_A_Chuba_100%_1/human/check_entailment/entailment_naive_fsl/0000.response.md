Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players. It first checks if the sum of the scores is even, which is a necessary condition for the scores to be valid. If the sum is odd, it prints -1, indicating that the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games and results.

If the sum is even, it calculates the maximum number of draws by subtracting the maximum possible number of wins (which is `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])`) from the total sum of scores and dividing the result by 2. This is because each draw contributes 2 points to the total sum, and each win contributes 2 points to the winner and 0 points to the loser.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where no games were played (i.e., all scores are 0), the case where there is only one game played (i.e., one score is 1 and the other two are 0), and the case where there are multiple games played with multiple draws.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work correctly, so I conclude that the program is correct.
