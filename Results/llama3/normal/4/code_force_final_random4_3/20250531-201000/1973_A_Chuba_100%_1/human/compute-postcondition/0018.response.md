Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `v` is a list of three integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30), stdin contains multiple test cases. If the sum of the three integers in `v` is odd, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the integer part of the average of the three integers in `v`, rounded down, is printed.***
