Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `v` is a list of three integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30), `result` is the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of the three integers in the list `v` even, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 0, the value of `_` remains 0, the list `v` remains unchanged with three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3, where 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30. A new variable `result` is introduced, which is calculated as the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of the three integers in the list `v` even. The stdin contains one less test case.
