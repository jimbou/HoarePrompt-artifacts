Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `v` is a list of three integers from the input, `result` is the average of the first two elements of `v` plus half of the third element of `v` if the third element is less than or equal to the sum of the first two elements, otherwise `result` is the average of the first two elements of `v`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 test case has been processed.**

In this output state, the value of `result` is calculated based on the values of `v`. If the third element of `v` is less than or equal to the sum of the first two elements, `result` is the average of the first two elements plus half of the third element. Otherwise, `result` is the average of the first two elements. The values of `t`, `_`, and `v` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases with one test case processed.
