Reasoning: 
The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible number of draws that could have happened given the scores of the three players. The program first checks if the sum of the scores is even, which is a necessary condition for the scores to be valid. If the sum is odd, it prints -1, indicating that the scores are not valid. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum possible number of draws by subtracting the maximum possible number of wins (which is the maximum of 0 and the difference between the third score and the sum of the first two scores) from the sum of the scores and dividing the result by 2. This is because each draw contributes 1 point to the total score, and each win contributes 2 points. The program then prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
