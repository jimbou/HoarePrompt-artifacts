The code prints the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of the three integers in the list `v` even.
Since the exact values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `result`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of the three integers in the list `v` even.
Output: **minimum number of operations required to make the sum of the three integers in the list `v` even**
