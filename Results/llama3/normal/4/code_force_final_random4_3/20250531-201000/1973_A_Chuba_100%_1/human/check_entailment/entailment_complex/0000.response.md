Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the three scores `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` and stores them in the list `v`.
3. The program checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the sum of the scores must be even according to the problem statement.
4. If the sum of the scores is even, the program calculates the maximum possible number of draws that could have happened. It does this by subtracting the maximum possible number of wins (i.e., `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])`) from the total sum of scores and dividing the result by 2. This is because each draw contributes 1 point to the total sum, and each win contributes 2 points.
5. The program prints the calculated result.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases according to the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
