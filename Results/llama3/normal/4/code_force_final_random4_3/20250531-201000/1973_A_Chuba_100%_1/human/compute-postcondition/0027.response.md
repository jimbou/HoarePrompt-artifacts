Output State: **`_` is equal to `t`, `v` is a list of three integers from the input, stdin contains no test cases. If the sum of the elements of `v` is odd, -1 is printed. Otherwise, if the third element of `v` is less than or equal to the sum of the first two elements, the average of the first two elements of `v` plus half of the third element of `v` is printed. Otherwise, the average of the first two elements of `v` is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has finished executing all iterations, and the variable `_` has reached the value of `t`, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The list `v` now contains the last set of three integers from the input, and there are no more test cases left in the input. The output will be either -1 if the sum of the elements in `v` is odd, or the calculated result based on the values of the elements in `v`, as described in the output state.
