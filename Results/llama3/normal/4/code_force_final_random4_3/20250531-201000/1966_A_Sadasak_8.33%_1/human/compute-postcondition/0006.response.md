To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `arr`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `arr`. If `arr` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `arr` must have at least one more element, and `num` must be the next integer in the list.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, the length of `arr` is n, where 2 <= n <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the first integer `num` in `arr` as a key and its count as the value, which is `k` if the original count of `num` is greater than `k`, otherwise the count remains 1, `num` is the second integer in the list.**
