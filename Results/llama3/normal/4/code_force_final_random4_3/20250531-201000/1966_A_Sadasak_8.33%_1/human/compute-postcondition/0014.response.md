Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, the length of `arr` is n, where 1 <= n <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with all integers in `arr` as keys and their counts as values, which are `k` if the original counts are greater than `k`, otherwise the counts remain the same.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the `frequency_table` dictionary will contain all unique integers from the `arr` list as keys, and their respective counts as values. If the count of any integer exceeds the value of `k`, the count will be capped at `k`. The `arr` list and the value of `k` remain unchanged.
