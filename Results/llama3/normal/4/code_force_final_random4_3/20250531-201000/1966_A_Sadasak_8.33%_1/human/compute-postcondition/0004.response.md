The code `frequency_table[num] = k` updates the value of the key `num` in the dictionary `frequency_table` to `k`. Since `num` is the first integer in the list `arr`, and `frequency_table` initially had the count of `num` as its value, which is greater than `k`, the new value of `frequency_table[num]` is now `k`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, the length of `arr` is n, where 1 <= n <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the first integer `num` in `arr` as a key and its count as the value, which is now equal to `k`, `num` is the first integer in the list.**
