Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, the length of `arr` is n, where 3 <= n <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the first integer in `arr` as a key and its count as the value, which is `k` if the original count of the first integer is greater than `k`, otherwise the count remains 1, `num` is the third integer in the list, and the count of `num` in `frequency_table` is now `k`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The list `arr` still contains at least 3 integers, and the value of `k` remains between 2 and 100. The length of `arr` is still `n`, which is between 3 and 100. The `frequency_table` dictionary still has the first integer in `arr` as a key, but the count of the third integer `num` in the dictionary has been updated to `k`.
