Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100, the length of `arr` is n, where 3 <= n <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the first integer in `arr` as a key and its count as the value, which is `k` if the original count of the first integer is greater than `k`, otherwise the count remains 1, `num` is the third integer in the list, and the count of `num` in `frequency_table` is `k` if the current count of `num` is greater than `k`, otherwise the count is incremented by 1 and then incremented by 1 again. If the count of `num` in `frequency_table` is greater than `k`, then the count of `num` is set to `k`.***
