The code updates the `frequency_table` dictionary by incrementing the count of the first integer `num` in the list `arr`. The `get` method is used to retrieve the current count of `num` in the dictionary, defaulting to 0 if it's not present. The count is then incremented by 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, the length of `arr` is n, where 1 <= n <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the first integer `num` in `arr` as a key and its count as the value, which is 1, `num` is the first integer in the list.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `arr` remains unchanged, the integer `k` remains unchanged, the length of `arr` remains unchanged, the dictionary `frequency_table` now contains the first integer `num` from the list `arr` as a key with a count of 1, and the variable `num` still holds the value of the first integer in the list.
