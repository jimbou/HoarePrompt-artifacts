Output State: **The program returns a dictionary, frequency_table, where all integers in the list 'arr' are keys and their counts are values. The counts are 'k' if the original counts are greater than 'k', otherwise the counts remain the same. 'k' is an integer between 2 and 100, and the length of 'arr' is 'n', where 1 <= n <= 100.**
