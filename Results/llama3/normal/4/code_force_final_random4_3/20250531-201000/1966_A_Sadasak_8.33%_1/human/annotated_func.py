#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, and the length of arr is n, where 1 <= n <= 100.

    for num in arr:

    #State: `arr` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, the length of `arr` is n, where 1 <= n <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with all integers in `arr` as keys and their counts as values, which are `k` if the original counts are greater than `k`, otherwise the counts remain the same.
    return frequency_table
    #The program returns a dictionary, frequency_table, where all integers in the list 'arr' are keys and their counts are values. The counts are 'k' if the original counts are greater than 'k', otherwise the counts remain the same. 'k' is an integer between 2 and 100, and the length of 'arr' is 'n', where 1 <= n <= 100.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a frequency table from a given list of integers, where the frequency of each integer is capped at a specified value 'k'. It takes a list of integers 'arr' and an integer 'k' as input, and returns a dictionary where each integer in 'arr' is a key and its frequency is the value, which is 'k' if the original frequency is greater than 'k', otherwise the original frequency. The function effectively limits the frequency of each integer in the list to 'k'.
