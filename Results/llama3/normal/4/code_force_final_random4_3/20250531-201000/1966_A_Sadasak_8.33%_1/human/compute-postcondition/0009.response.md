Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, the length of `arr` is n, where 2 <= n <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the first integer `num` in `arr` as a key and its count as the value, which is `k` if the original count of `num` is greater than `k`, otherwise the count remains 1, `num` is the second integer in the list, and the count of `num` in `frequency_table` is `k` if the current count of `num` is greater than `k`, otherwise the count is incremented by 1.***
