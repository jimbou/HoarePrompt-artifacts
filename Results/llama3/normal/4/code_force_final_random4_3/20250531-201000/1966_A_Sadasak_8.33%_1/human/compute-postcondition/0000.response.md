Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, the length of `arr` is n, where 1 <= n <= 100, and `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary.**

In this output state, the values of `arr`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `frequency_table`, which is initialized as an empty dictionary.
