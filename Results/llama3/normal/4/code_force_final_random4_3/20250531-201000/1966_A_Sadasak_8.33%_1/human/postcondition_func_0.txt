This function generates a frequency table from a given list of integers, where the frequency of each integer is capped at a specified value 'k'. It takes a list of integers 'arr' and an integer 'k' as input, and returns a dictionary where each integer in 'arr' is a key and its frequency is the value, which is 'k' if the original frequency is greater than 'k', otherwise the original frequency. The function effectively limits the frequency of each integer in the list to 'k'.
