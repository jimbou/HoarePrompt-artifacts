Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, the length of `arr` is n, where 2 <= n <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the first integer `num` in `arr` as a key and its count as the value, which is `k` if the original count of `num` is greater than `k`, otherwise the count remains 1, `num` is the second integer in the list, and the count of `num` in `frequency_table` is `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `arr` still contains at least 2 integers, and the integer `k` is still between 2 and 100. The length of `arr` is still `n`, which is between 2 and 100. The dictionary `frequency_table` still has the first integer in `arr` as a key, but now its count is `k`. The integer `num` is still the second integer in the list, and its count in `frequency_table` is now `k`.
