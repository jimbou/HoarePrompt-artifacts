Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by first checking if k is greater than n, in which case the minimum number of cards left is n. If k is equal to n, the minimum number of cards left is k-1.

However, the program's logic for the case where k is less than n is incorrect. The function func_1 is creating a frequency table of the numbers on the cards, but it is not being used correctly to determine the minimum number of cards left.

The program is checking if k is in the frequency table's values, and if so, it prints k-1. However, this is not a correct solution to the problem. The correct solution would involve finding the maximum number of cards that can be exchanged for k-1 cards, and then repeating this process until no more exchanges can be made.

The program is also not correctly handling the case where the frequency of a number is greater than k. In this case, the program should exchange k cards for k-1 cards, and then repeat this process until the frequency of the number is less than or equal to k.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
