Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, the length of `arr` is n, where 1 <= n <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the first integer `num` in `arr` as a key and its count as the value, which is greater than `k`, `num` is the first integer in the list.**
