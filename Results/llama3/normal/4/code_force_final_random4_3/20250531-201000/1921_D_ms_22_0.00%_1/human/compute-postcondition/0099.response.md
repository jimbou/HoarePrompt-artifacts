Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max_heap` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, `tp1` is either 0 or `tp1 + 1`, `tp2` is either `m - 1` or `m - 2`, `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the elements of `b` which are closest to them minus the absolute difference between the last element in the list `a` and the element of `b` which is closest to it, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, `item` is the smallest tuple in the `max_heap` list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and the second element of the smallest tuple in the `max_heap` list is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive. The third element of the smallest tuple in the `max_heap` list is either equal to `tp1` or not equal to `tp1`***
