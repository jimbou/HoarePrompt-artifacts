Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, n is an integer, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is a list containing three tuples, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the third element in the list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, diff1 is the absolute difference between the third element of a and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the third element of a and the last element of b. If diff1 > diff2, max_heap contains three tuples. Otherwise, max_heap also contains three tuples.***
