Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max_heap` is a list containing one tuple (-diff2, i, m - 1), `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first element in the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `b`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, except for `max_heap`, which now contains a tuple with the negative of the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `b`, the first element of `a`, and the last index of `b`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
