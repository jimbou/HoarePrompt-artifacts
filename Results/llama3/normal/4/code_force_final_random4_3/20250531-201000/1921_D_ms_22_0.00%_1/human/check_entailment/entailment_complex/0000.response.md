Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by choosing n integers from the array b_i and arranging them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i of length n, such that the total difference D = âˆ‘_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| is as large as possible.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the values of n and m, followed by the arrays a_i and b_i. It sorts the array b_i in ascending order. Then, for each element in a_i, it calculates the absolute differences with the smallest and largest elements in b_i and pushes the maximum difference along with the index of the element in b_i into a max heap.

After that, it pops elements from the max heap and calculates the absolute difference with the closest element in b_i. If the index of the element in b_i is within the range [tp1, tp2], it adds the difference to the answer and updates tp1 or tp2 accordingly. If the index is outside the range, it calculates the absolute difference with the closest element in the range [tp1, tp2] and adds it to the answer.

Finally, it prints the maximum total difference D for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
