Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0 but 2 less than its original value, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, b is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 2 fewer inputs: two space-separated lists of integers, i is the third element in the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between the third element of a and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the third element of a and the last element of b, max_heap contains three tuples: one with the negative value of diff1, the value of i, and 0 if diff1 is greater than diff2, otherwise it contains one tuple with the negative value of diff2, the value of i, and m - 1, and another tuple with the negative value of diff1, the value of i, and 0 if diff1 is greater than diff2, otherwise it contains one tuple with the negative value of diff2, the value of i, and m - 1, and a new tuple with the negative value of diff1, the value of i, and 0 if diff1 is greater than diff2, otherwise it contains a new tuple with the negative value of diff2, the value of i, and m - 1, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, and ans is 0***
