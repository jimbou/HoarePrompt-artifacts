According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is not explicitly stated, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is equal to `m`, `tp2` is equal to 0, `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the elements of `b` which are closest to them, and the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the elements of `b` which are closest to them is being printed, and `t` is greater than 0**
