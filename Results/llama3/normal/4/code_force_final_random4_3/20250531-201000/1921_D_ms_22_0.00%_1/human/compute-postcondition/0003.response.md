Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0.**

Here's a natural language description of the output state:

The value of `t` has been decremented by 1, so it is now an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive. The number of test cases in stdin has also been reduced by 1. The values of `n` and `m` have been assigned from the input, so they are now integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive. The list `a` contains `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and the list `b` contains `m` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, sorted in ascending order. The `max_heap` list is empty, and the variables `tp1` and `tp2` have been initialized to 0 and `m - 1`, respectively. The variable `ans` has been initialized to 0.
