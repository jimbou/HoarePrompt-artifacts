The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a. If the list a has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, ans is the sum of the absolute differences between the last element of a and the elements of b. So for the loop to be executed  the list a must have at least 1 element and the i is the first element in the list a.
State: **t is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, n is an integer, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the first element in the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
