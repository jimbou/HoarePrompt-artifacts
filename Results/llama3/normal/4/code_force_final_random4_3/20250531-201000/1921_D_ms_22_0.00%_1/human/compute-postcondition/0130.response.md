Postcondition: **t is greater than 0 but 1 less than its original value, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, b is a sorted list of integers, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains 2 fewer inputs: two space-separated lists of integers, i is the first element in the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b. The current value of diff1 is greater than the current value of diff2.**
