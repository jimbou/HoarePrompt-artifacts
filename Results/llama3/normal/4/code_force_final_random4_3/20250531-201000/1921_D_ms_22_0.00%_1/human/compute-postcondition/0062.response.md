The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the absolute differences between the last element of list `a` and the elements of list `b`. Since `a` has only one element, the last element of `a` is the only element of `a`. The absolute differences are calculated between this single element of `a` and all elements of `b`.

Output: **the sum of the absolute differences between the single element of list a and all elements of list b**
