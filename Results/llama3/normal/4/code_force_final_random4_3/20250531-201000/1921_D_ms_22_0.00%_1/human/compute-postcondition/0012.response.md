Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive that must have at least 2 elements, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is a list containing one tuple either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 1), tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the second element of the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between i and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between i and the last element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code snippet does not modify any variables except for `diff1` and `diff2`, which are reassigned the absolute differences between `i` and the first and last elements of `b`, respectively. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
