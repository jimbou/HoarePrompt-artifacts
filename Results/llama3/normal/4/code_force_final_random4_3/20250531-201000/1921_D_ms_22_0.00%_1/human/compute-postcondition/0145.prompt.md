Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0 but 1 less than its original value, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains 2 fewer inputs: two space-separated lists of integers
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    diff1 = abs(i - b[0])
    diff2 = abs(i - b[m - 1])
    if diff1 > diff2:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))
    else:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is greater than 0 but 1 less than its original value, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, b is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 2 fewer inputs: two space-separated lists of integers, i is the first element in the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b. If diff1 is greater than diff2, max_heap contains one tuple with the negative value of diff1, the value of i, and 0, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, and ans is 0. If diff1 is less than or equal to diff2, max_heap contains one tuple with the negative value of diff2, the value of i, and m - 1, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, and ans is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is greater than 0 but 1 less than its original value, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, b is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 2 fewer inputs: two space-separated lists of integers, i is the second element in the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the last element of b, max_heap contains two tuples: one with the negative value of diff1, the value of i, and 0 if diff1 is greater than diff2, otherwise it contains one tuple with the negative value of diff2, the value of i, and m - 1, and another tuple with the negative value of diff1, the value of i, and 0 if diff1 is greater than diff2, otherwise it contains one tuple with the negative value of diff2, the value of i, and m - 1, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, and ans is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is greater than 0 but 2 less than its original value, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, b is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 2 fewer inputs: two space-separated lists of integers, i is the third element in the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between the third element of a and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the third element of a and the last element of b, max_heap contains three tuples: one with the negative value of diff1, the value of i, and 0 if diff1 is greater than diff2, otherwise it contains one tuple with the negative value of diff2, the value of i, and m - 1, and another tuple with the negative value of diff1, the value of i, and 0 if diff1 is greater than diff2, otherwise it contains one tuple with the negative value of diff2, the value of i, and m - 1, and a new tuple with the negative value of diff1, the value of i, and 0 if diff1 is greater than diff2, otherwise it contains a new tuple with the negative value of diff2, the value of i, and m - 1, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, and ans is 0




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
