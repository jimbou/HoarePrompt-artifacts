Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max_heap` is a list containing two tuples either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 1), `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the second element of the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that the `max_heap` list now contains two tuples, one of which is the newly added tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
