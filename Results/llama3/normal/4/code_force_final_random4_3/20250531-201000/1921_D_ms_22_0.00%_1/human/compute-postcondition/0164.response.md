Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is not empty, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains 2 fewer inputs: two space-separated lists of integers, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, `item` is the tuple with the second maximum value in `max_heap`**

The value of `item` is updated to the tuple with the second maximum value in `max_heap` after the maximum value is popped from the heap. The values of the other variables are not affected.
