Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list with one element, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 1), `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 2`, `ans` is `diff1` or `diff2`, `i` is the last element of the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, `item` is the maximum tuple from the heap, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The index of the item is between tp1 and tp2 inclusive. The third element of the item is not equal to tp1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `tp2` has been decremented by 1, resulting in `tp2` being `m - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties. The index of the item is still between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, and the third element of the item is not equal to `tp1`.
