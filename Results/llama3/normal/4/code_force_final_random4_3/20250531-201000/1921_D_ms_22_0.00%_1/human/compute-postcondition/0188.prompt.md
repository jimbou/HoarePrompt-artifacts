Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The program is being run as the main module, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines: the first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5), the second line contains n space-separated integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), and the third line contains m space-separated integers b_i (1 <= b_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b.sort()
    max_heap = []
    tp1 = 0
    tp2 = m - 1
    ans = 0
    for i in a:
        diff1 = abs(i - b[0])
        diff2 = abs(i - b[m - 1])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))
        else:
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))
    while max_heap:
        item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
        if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
            diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
            diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
            if diff1 > diff2:
                tp1 += 1
                ans += diff1
            else:
                tp2 -= 1
                ans += diff2
        else:
            ans += -item[0]
            if item[2] == tp1:
                tp1 += 1
            else:
                tp2 -= 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, n is 0, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list with one element, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is either 0 or m, tp2 is either 0 or m, ans is the sum of the absolute differences between the last element of a and the elements of b, i is the last element of the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between i and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between i and the last element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the sum of the absolute differences between the last element of a and the elements of b which is ans is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is equal to `m`, `tp2` is equal to 0, `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the elements of `b` which are closest to them, and the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the elements of `b` which are closest to them is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is n, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is not empty, b is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 0 inputs, i is the last element in the list a, max_heap is empty, tp1 is m, tp2 is 0, and ans is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of a and the elements of b that are closest to them, and the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of a and the elements of b that are closest to them is being printed


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
