Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, n is an integer, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the first element in the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**

The code snippet provided does not modify any variables except for `diff1` and `diff2`. The first line calculates the absolute difference between the first element of list `a` (denoted by `i`) and the first element of list `b`, and assigns this value to `diff1`. The second line calculates the absolute difference between the first element of list `a` (denoted by `i`) and the last element of list `b`, and assigns this value to `diff2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
