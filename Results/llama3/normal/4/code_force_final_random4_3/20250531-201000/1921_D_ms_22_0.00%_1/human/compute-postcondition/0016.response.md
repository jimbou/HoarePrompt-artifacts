The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and list `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of the list `a`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list `a` must have at least 3 elements and `i` is the third element of the list `a`.
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive that must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max_heap` is a list containing two tuples either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 1), `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the third element of the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**
