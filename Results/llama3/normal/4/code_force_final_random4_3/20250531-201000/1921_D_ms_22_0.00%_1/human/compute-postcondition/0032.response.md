Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list with one element, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 1), `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `diff1` or `diff2`, `i` is the last element of the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, `item` is the maximum tuple from the heap, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The index of the item is between tp1 and tp2 inclusive.**

The code increments the value of `ans` by the negation of the first element of the `item` tuple, which is either `-diff1` or `-diff2`. Since `diff1` and `diff2` are the absolute differences between `i` and the first and last elements of `b` respectively, `ans` is now equal to either `diff1` or `diff2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
