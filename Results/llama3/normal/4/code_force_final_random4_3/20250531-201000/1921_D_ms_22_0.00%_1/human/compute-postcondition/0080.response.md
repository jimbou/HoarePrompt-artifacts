Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, n is an integer, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is a list containing three tuples, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the third element in the list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, diff1 is the absolute difference between the third element of a and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the third element of a and the last element of b.**

In this output state, the values of t, n, m, a, b, tp1, tp2, ans, i, stdin, diff1, and diff2 remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is in the max_heap list, which now contains three tuples instead of two. The new tuple added to max_heap is (-diff1, i, 0), where -diff1 is the negative of the absolute difference between the third element of a and the first element of b, i is the third element in the list a, and 0 is the index of the first element in b.
