To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `max_heap` since it's the only variable in the loop head. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether `max_heap` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `max_heap` contains `n - 1` tuples. To ensure the loop can execute again, `max_heap` must contain at least one tuple. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is not empty, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains 2 fewer inputs: two space-separated lists of integers, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, `item` is the tuple with the maximum value in `max_heap`**
