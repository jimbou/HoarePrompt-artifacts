To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `a` is a list of `n` integers and `n` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, we can conclude that `a` must have at least 1 element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `a` to reflect this.

Additionally, since `i` is the loop variable, we need to initialize it to the first element of the list `a`. 

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first element of the list `a`**
