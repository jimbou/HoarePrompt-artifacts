Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is not empty, b is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 2 fewer inputs: two space-separated lists of integers, i is the last element in the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the last element of b, max_heap contains n - 1 tuples, tp1 is 1, tp2 is m - 1, ans is equal to the original value of diff1, and item is the tuple with the maximum value in max_heap.**

The code snippet increments `tp1` by 1, making it 1, and adds the value of `diff1` to `ans`, making `ans` equal to the original value of `diff1`. No other variables are affected by the code.
