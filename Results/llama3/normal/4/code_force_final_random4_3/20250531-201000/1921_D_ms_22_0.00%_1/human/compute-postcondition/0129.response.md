Output State: **t is greater than 0 but 1 less than its original value, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, b is a sorted list of integers, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains 2 fewer inputs: two space-separated lists of integers, i is the first element in the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, and `stdin` remain unchanged from the initial state. The code only introduces two new variables, `diff1` and `diff2`, which are calculated based on the first element of `a` and the first and last elements of `b`, respectively. The value of `i` is also unchanged, as it is still the first element of the list `a`.
