Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is not empty, b is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 0 inputs, i is the last element in the list a, max_heap is empty, tp1 is m, tp2 is 0, and ans is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of a and the elements of b that are closest to them.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the program has processed all the test cases. The variable t is now 0, indicating that the loop has finished. The variables n, m, a, and b still hold the values from the last test case. The variable i is the last element in the list a, and max_heap is empty. The variables tp1 and tp2 are now equal to m and 0, respectively. The variable ans holds the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of a and the elements of b that are closest to them, which is the result of the last test case. The program has also consumed all the input from stdin.
