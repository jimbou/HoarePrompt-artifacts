The only variable in the loop head is `max_heap`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `max_heap`. If `max_heap` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the maximum tuple from the heap has been removed. So for the loop to be executed one more time the heap must not be empty after removing the maximum tuple. This means that the heap must have contained at least two tuples either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 1) at the end of the last iteration.
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list with one element, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max_heap` is a list containing at least two tuples either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 1), `tp1` is either 0, 1 or 2, `tp2` is either m - 1, m - 2 or m - 3, `ans` is either diff1, diff2, diff1 + diff2 or 2 * diff1 or 2 * diff2, `i` is the last element of the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, `item` is the maximum tuple from the heap, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
