Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: two space-separated integers n and m, followed by n space-separated integers a_i, and then m space-separated integers b_i. It calculates the sum of the absolute differences between each element in a_i and the closest element in b_i, and prints this sum for each test case. The function continues to process test cases until the input is exhausted.**
