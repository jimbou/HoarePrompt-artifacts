Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is an empty list, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is a list containing n tuples either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 1), tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the last element of the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between i and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between i and the last element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, n is greater than 0, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list with one element, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is a list containing n-1 tuples either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 1), tp1 is either 0 or 1, tp2 is either m - 1 or m - 2, ans is either diff1 or diff2, i is the last element of the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between i and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between i and the last element of b, item is the maximum tuple from the heap, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the index of the item is out of the range [tp1, tp2], then tp1 is 1 if diff1 > diff2, otherwise tp1 is 0, and tp2 is m - 1 if diff1 > diff2, otherwise tp2 is m - 2, and ans is diff1 if diff1 > diff2, otherwise ans is diff2. If the index of the item is within the range [tp1, tp2], then if the third element of the item is equal to tp1, tp1 is 1, otherwise tp1 is 0 and tp2 is m - 2.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list with one element, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max_heap` is a list containing at least one tuple either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 1), `tp1` is either 0, 1 or 2, `tp2` is either m - 1, m - 2 or m - 3, `ans` is either diff1, diff2, diff1 + diff2 or 2 * diff1 or 2 * diff2, `i` is the last element of the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, `item` is the maximum tuple from the heap, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the maximum tuple from the heap has been removed. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `tp1` and `tp2` are updated to either 0, 1 or 2 and either m - 1, m - 2 or m - 3 respectively. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to either `diff1 + diff2` or 2 * `diff1` or 2 * `diff2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list with one element, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max_heap` is a list containing at least one tuple either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 1), `tp1` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, `tp2` is either m - 1, m - 2, m - 3, m - 4, `ans` is either diff1, diff2, diff1 + diff2, 2 * diff1, 2 * diff2, diff1 + 2 * diff2, 2 * diff1 + diff2, 2 * diff1 + 2 * diff2, 3 * diff1, 3 * diff2, diff1 + (-item[0]), diff2 + (-item[0]), diff1 + diff2 + (-item[0]), 2 * diff1 + (-item[0]), 2 * diff2 + (-item[0]), `i` is the last element of the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, `item` is the maximum tuple from the heap, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is either 1, 2 or 3, otherwise `tp1` is either 0, 1 or 2. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp2` is either m - 1, m - 2 or m - 3, otherwise `tp2` is either m - 2, m - 3 or m - 4.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
