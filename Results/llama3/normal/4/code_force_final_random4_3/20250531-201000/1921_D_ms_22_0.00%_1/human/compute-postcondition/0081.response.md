Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max_heap` is a list containing three tuples, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the third element in the list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and the last element of `b`.**

The code pushes a new tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` onto the `max_heap` list. The `-diff2` value is used as the priority for the heap, which means the tuple with the largest `diff2` value will have the highest priority. The `i` and `m - 1` values are additional data associated with the tuple. The `max_heap` list now contains three tuples. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
