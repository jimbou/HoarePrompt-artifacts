Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, n is an integer, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, tp1 is tp1 + 1, tp2 is m - 1, ans is ans + diff1, i is the last element in the list a, item is the smallest tuple in the max_heap list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp1 + 1], diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp2].**

The code increments the value of `tp1` by 1 and adds the current value of `diff1` to `ans`. The value of `tp1` is now one more than its original value, and `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`. The value of `diff1` is updated to be the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1 + 1]`. No other variables are affected.
