The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive, n is 0, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list with one element, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is either 0 or m, tp2 is either 0 or m, ans is the sum of the absolute differences between the last element of a and the elements of b, i is the last element of the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between i and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between i and the last element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the sum of the absolute differences between the last element of a and the elements of b which is ans is being printed**
