Postcondition: ***t is either 0 or 1, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is not empty, b is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 0 inputs, i is the last element in the list a, item is the tuple with the maximum value in max_heap, max_heap is not empty but has one less element than before. If diff1 is greater than diff2, tp1 is incremented by 1 and ans is incremented by the original value of diff1. Otherwise, tp2 is one less than its original value and ans is increased by the absolute difference between the second element of item and the element at index tp2 in b.***
