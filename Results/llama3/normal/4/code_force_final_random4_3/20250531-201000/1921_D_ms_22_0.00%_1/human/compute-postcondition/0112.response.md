The only variable in the loop head is `max_heap`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `max_heap`. If `max_heap` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `max_heap` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple. So for the loop to be executed one more time `max_heap` must contain at least two tuples.
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max_heap` is a non-empty list containing at least two tuples, `tp1` and `tp2` are updated based on the comparison of `diff1` and `diff2`, `ans` is the updated sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the elements of `b` which are closest to them, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, `item` is the second smallest tuple in the `max_heap` list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one.**
