Output State: **t is either 0 or 1, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is not empty, b is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 0 inputs, i is the last element in the list a, item is the tuple with the maximum value in max_heap, max_heap is not empty but has one less element than before, tp2 is one less than its original value, diff1 is the absolute difference between the second element of item and the element at index tp1 in b, ans is increased by the absolute difference between the second element of item and the element at index tp2 in b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the second element of item and the element at index tp2 in b.**

The code snippet modifies the values of tp2 and ans. The first line decrements tp2 by 1, and the second line adds the value of diff2 to ans. The values of t, n, m, a, b, stdin, i, item, max_heap, diff1, and tp1 remain unchanged.
