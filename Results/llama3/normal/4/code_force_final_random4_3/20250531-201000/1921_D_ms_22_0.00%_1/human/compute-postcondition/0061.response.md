Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, n is 0, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list with one element, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is either 0 or m, tp2 is either 0 or m, ans is the sum of the absolute differences between the last element of a and the elements of b, i is the last element of the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between i and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between i and the last element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive.
* The value of `n` becomes 0, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times.
* The value of `m` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive.
* The list `a` still contains only one element.
* The list `b` remains unchanged, still a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
* The list `max_heap` becomes empty, indicating that all tuples have been processed.
* The value of `tp1` is either 0 or `m`, depending on the last iteration of the loop.
* The value of `tp2` is either 0 or `m`, depending on the last iteration of the loop.
* The value of `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between the last element of `a` and the elements of `b`.
* The value of `i` remains unchanged, still the last element of the list `a`.
* The value of `diff1` remains unchanged, still the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`.
* The value of `diff2` remains unchanged, still the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`.
* The value of `stdin` remains unchanged, still containing multiple test cases minus one.
