Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max_heap` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, `tp1` and `tp2` are updated based on the comparison of `diff1` and `diff2`, `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the elements of `b` which are closest to them, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, `item` is the smallest tuple in the `max_heap` list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `tp1` and `tp2` are updated based on the comparison of `diff1` and `diff2`, and `ans` is increased by the maximum of `diff1` and `diff2`. Otherwise, `tp1` and `tp2` are updated based on the comparison of `diff1` and `diff2`, and `ans` is increased by the minimum of `diff1` and `diff2`.**
