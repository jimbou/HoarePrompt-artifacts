The only variable in the loop head is variable max_heap, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable max_heap.  If max_heap is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, max_heap is empty, So for the loop to be executed one more time max_heap must not be empty.
State: **`t` is either 0 or 1. `n` is greater than 0. `m` is an integer. `a` is not empty. `b` is a sorted list of integers. `stdin` contains 0 inputs. `i` is the last element in the list `a`. `item` is the tuple with the second maximum value in `max_heap`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `ans` is incremented by the original value of `diff1` if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, or `ans` is incremented by the original value of `diff2` otherwise. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `t` is 1 and `ans` is increased by the negative of the first element of `item`. If `item[2]` is not equal to `tp1`, then `t` is 0, `tp2` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by the negative of the first element of `item`. max_heap is not empty.**
