Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, n is an integer, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, tp1 is incremented by 1, tp2 is unchanged, ans is the updated sum of the absolute differences between the elements of a and the elements of b which are closest to them plus diff1, i is the last element in the list a, item is the smallest tuple in the max_heap list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp1] before the increment, diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp2].**

In this output state, `tp1` has been incremented by 1, and `ans` has been updated by adding `diff1` to it. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. `tp2`, `i`, `item`, `diff1`, and `diff2` retain their previous values. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, containing multiple test cases minus one.
