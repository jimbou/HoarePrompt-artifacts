The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of list `a` and the elements of list `b` that are closest to them.

Since the exact elements of lists `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated sum of absolute differences.

Output: **the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of list a and the elements of list b that are closest to them**
