Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, n is an integer, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 2, ans is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of a and the elements of b which are closest to them plus diff2, i is the last element in the list a, item is the smallest tuple in the max_heap list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp1], and diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp2 - 1].**

In this output state, the value of tp2 has been decremented by 1, and the value of ans has been incremented by diff2. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
