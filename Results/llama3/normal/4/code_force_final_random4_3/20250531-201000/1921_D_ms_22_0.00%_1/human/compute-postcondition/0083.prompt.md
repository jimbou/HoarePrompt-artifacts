Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, n is an integer, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the last element of the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between i and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between i and the last element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the sum of the absolute differences between the last element of a and the elements of b which is ans is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    diff1 = abs(i - b[0])
    diff2 = abs(i - b[m - 1])
    if diff1 > diff2:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))
    else:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, n is an integer, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is a list containing one tuple, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the first element in the list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, then max_heap contains the tuple (-diff1, i, 0). Otherwise, max_heap contains the tuple (-diff2, i, m - 1).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, n is an integer, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is a list containing two tuples, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the second element in the list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, diff1 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the last element of b. If diff1 > diff2, max_heap contains two tuples. Otherwise, max_heap also contains two tuples.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, n is an integer, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is a list containing three tuples, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the third element in the list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, diff1 is the absolute difference between the third element of a and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the third element of a and the last element of b. If diff1 > diff2, max_heap contains three tuples. Otherwise, max_heap also contains three tuples.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
