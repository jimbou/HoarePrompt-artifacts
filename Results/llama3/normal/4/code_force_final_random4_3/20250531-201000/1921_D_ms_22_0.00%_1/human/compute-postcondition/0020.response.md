Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive that must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max_heap` is a list containing three tuples either (-diff1, i, 0), (-diff2, i, m - 1) or (-diff1, i, 0), `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the third element of the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `max_heap` contains three tuples either (-diff1, i, 0), (-diff2, i, m - 1) or (-diff1, i, 0). Otherwise, `max_heap` contains three tuples either (-diff1, i, 0), (-diff2, i, m - 1), or (-diff2, i, m - 1).**
