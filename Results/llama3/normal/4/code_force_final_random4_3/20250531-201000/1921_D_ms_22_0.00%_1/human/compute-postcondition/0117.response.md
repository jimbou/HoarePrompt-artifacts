Postcondition: **t is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, n is an integer, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, tp1 and tp2 are updated based on the comparison of diff1 and diff2, ans is the updated sum of the absolute differences between the elements of a and the elements of b which are closest to them, i is the last element in the list a, item is the smallest tuple in the max_heap list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp1], diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp2]. If diff1 > diff2, then tp1 is incremented by 1 and ans is incremented by diff1. Otherwise, tp2 is decremented by 1 and ans is incremented by diff2.**
