Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is an empty list, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is a list containing n tuples either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 1), tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the last element of the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between i and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between i and the last element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `a` is empty, indicating that all elements have been processed. The list `max_heap` contains `n` tuples, where each tuple represents the difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element of `b`, along with the index of the element in `b` used for the comparison. The variables `tp1` and `tp2` remain unchanged, and `ans` is still 0. The value of `i` is the last element of the list `a`, and `diff1` and `diff2` are the absolute differences between this last element and the first and last elements of `b`, respectively.
