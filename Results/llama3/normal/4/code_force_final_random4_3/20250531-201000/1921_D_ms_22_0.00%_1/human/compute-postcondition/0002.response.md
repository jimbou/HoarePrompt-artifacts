To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the condition `t > 0`. Since `t` is already defined as an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, it inherently satisfies the condition for the loop to execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **The program is being run as the main module, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines: the first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5), the second line contains n space-separated integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), and the third line contains m space-separated integers b_i (1 <= b_i <= 10^9).**
