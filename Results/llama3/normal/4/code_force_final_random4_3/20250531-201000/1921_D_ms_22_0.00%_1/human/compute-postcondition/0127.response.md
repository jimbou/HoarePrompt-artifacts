Output State: **t is greater than 0 but 1 less than its original value, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains 2 fewer inputs: two space-separated lists of integers**

In this output state, the value of `t` has decreased by 1, and `n` and `m` have been assigned integer values from the input. The lists `a` and `b` have been created from the input, with `b` being sorted in ascending order. The variables `tp1` and `tp2` have been reset to 0 and `m - 1`, respectively. The variable `ans` has been reset to 0. The `max_heap` list remains empty. Stdin now contains two fewer inputs, which were used to create the lists `a` and `b`.
