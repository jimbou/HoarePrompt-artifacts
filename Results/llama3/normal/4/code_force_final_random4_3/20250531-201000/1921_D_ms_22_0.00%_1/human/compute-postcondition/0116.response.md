Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, n is an integer, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, tp1 and tp2 are updated based on the comparison of diff1 and diff2, ans is the updated sum of the absolute differences between the elements of a and the elements of b which are closest to them, i is the last element in the list a, item is the smallest tuple in the max_heap list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp1], diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp2], tp2 is decremented by 1, ans is incremented by diff2.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial properties, with the exception of `tp2` and `ans`. The value of `tp2` is decremented by 1, and the value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `diff2`, which is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, including `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, `tp1`, `i`, `item`, and `stdin`.
