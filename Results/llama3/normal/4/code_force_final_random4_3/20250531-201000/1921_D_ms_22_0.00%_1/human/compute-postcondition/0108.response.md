Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max_heap` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, `tp1` is incremented by 1, `tp2` is updated based on the comparison of `diff1` and `diff2`, `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the elements of `b` which are closest to them minus the value of the second smallest tuple in the `max_heap` list, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, `item` is the second smallest tuple in the `max_heap` list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `tp1` has been incremented by 1, while the values of all other variables remain unchanged. The state of the program is still valid, with `t` being an integer between 0 and 98, `n` and `m` being integers, `a` and `b` being lists of integers, `max_heap` being a non-empty list of tuples, `tp2` being updated based on the comparison of `diff1` and `diff2`, `ans` being the sum of absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` minus the value of the second smallest tuple in `max_heap`, `i` being the last element in `a`, and `item` being the second smallest tuple in `max_heap`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
