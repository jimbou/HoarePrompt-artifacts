Postcondition: ***`t` is either 0, 1 or 2. `n` is greater than 0. `m` is an integer. `a` is not empty. `b` is a sorted list of integers. `stdin` contains 0 inputs. `i` is the last element in the list `a`. `item` is the tuple with the maximum value in `max_heap`. `max_heap` is not empty but has one less element than before. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is incremented by the original value of `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is one less than its original value and `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the element at index `tp2` in `b`. If `item[2]` is not less than `tp1` and not greater than `tp2`, then `ans` is increased by the negation of the first element of `item`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `t` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `t` is either 0 or 1 and `tp2` is decreased by 1.***
