Output State: **`t` is either 0 or 1. `n` is greater than 0. `m` is an integer. `a` is not empty. `b` is a sorted list of integers. `stdin` contains 0 inputs. `i` is the last element in the list `a`. `item` is the tuple with the maximum value in `max_heap`. `max_heap` is not empty but has one less element than before. `ans` is increased by the negation of the first element of `item`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been updated by adding the negation of the first element of `item`. The other variables remain unchanged.
