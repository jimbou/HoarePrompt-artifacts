Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `b` is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max_heap` is a list containing two tuples, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is m - 1, `ans` is 0, `i` is the second element in the list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the last element of `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `i`, `diff1`, `diff2` and stdin remains the same as in the initial state. The `max_heap` now contains two tuples, the first one is the same as before and the second one is `(-diff1, i, 0)`.
