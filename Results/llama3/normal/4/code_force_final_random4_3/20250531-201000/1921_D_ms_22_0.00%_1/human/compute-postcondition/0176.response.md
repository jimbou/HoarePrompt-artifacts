Output State: **t is either 0 or 1, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is not empty, b is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 0 inputs, i is the last element in the list a, item is the tuple with the maximum value in max_heap, max_heap is not empty but has one less element than before, diff1 is the absolute difference between the second element of item and the element at index tp1 in b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the second element of item and the element at index tp2 in b.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `stdin`, `i`, `item`, and `max_heap` remain unchanged from the initial state. The code only introduces two new variables, `diff1` and `diff2`, which are calculated based on the values of `item` and `b`. The absolute differences between the second element of `item` and the elements at indices `tp1` and `tp2` in `b` are assigned to `diff1` and `diff2`, respectively.
