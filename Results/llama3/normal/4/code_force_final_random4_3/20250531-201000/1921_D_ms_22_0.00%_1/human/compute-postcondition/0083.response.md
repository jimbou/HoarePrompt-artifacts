Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, n is an integer, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is a list containing len(a) tuples, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of a and the elements of b which are closest to them, i is the last element in the list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same values for t, n, m, b, tp1, tp2, and stdin as in the initial state. The list a will be the same as in the initial state. The list max_heap will contain len(a) tuples, where each tuple represents the maximum absolute difference between an element of a and the closest element of b. The variable ans will hold the sum of these maximum absolute differences. The variable i will be the last element in the list a.
