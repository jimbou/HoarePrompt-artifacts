Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, n is greater than 0, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list with one element, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is a list containing n-1 tuples either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 1), tp1 is 1, tp2 is m - 1, ans is diff1, i is the last element of the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the last element of b, item is the maximum tuple from the heap, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code increments `tp1` by 1, making it equal to 1. It also adds the current value of `diff1` to `ans`, making `ans` equal to `diff1`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
