Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list with one element, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 1), `tp1` is 1, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `diff1` or `diff2`, `i` is the last element of the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, `item` is the maximum tuple from the heap, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The index of the item is between tp1 and tp2 inclusive. The current value of item[2] is equal to tp1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `tp1` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The index of the item is still between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, and the current value of `item[2]` is equal to the new value of `tp1`, which is 1.
