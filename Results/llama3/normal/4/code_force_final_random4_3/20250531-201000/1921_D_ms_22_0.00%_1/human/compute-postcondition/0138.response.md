Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 2 fewer inputs: two space-separated lists of integers, `i` is the second element in the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the last element of `b`, `max_heap` contains two tuples: one with the negative value of `diff1`, the value of `i`, and 0 if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, otherwise it contains one tuple with the negative value of `diff2`, the value of `i`, and `m - 1`, and another tuple with the negative value of `diff2`, the value of `i`, and `m - 1`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains the same, `n` and `m` are still integers, `a` and `b` are still lists of integers with `a` having at least 2 elements and `b` being sorted. The stdin still contains 2 fewer inputs. The values of `i`, `diff1`, `diff2`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The `max_heap` now contains two tuples: the original tuple and a new tuple with the negative value of `diff2`, the value of `i`, and `m - 1`.
