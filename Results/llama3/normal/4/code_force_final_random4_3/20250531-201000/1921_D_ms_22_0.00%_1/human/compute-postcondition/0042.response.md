Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, n is greater than 0, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list with one element, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is a list containing at least one tuple either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 1), tp1 is either 1 or 2, tp2 is either m - 1 or m - 2, ans is either diff1 + diff2 or 2 * diff1, i is the last element of the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the last element of b, item is the maximum tuple from the heap, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the maximum tuple from the heap has been removed.**

The first line increments tp1 by 1, making it either 1 or 2. The second line adds diff1 to ans, making it either diff1 + diff2 or 2 * diff1. No other variables are affected.
