Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, n is an integer, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is a list containing len(a) tuples, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of a and the elements of b which are closest to them, i is the last element in the list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max_heap` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, `tp1` and `tp2` are updated based on the comparison of `diff1` and `diff2`, `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the elements of `b` which are closest to them, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, `item` is the smallest tuple in the `max_heap` list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `tp1` and `tp2` are updated based on the comparison of `diff1` and `diff2`, and `ans` is increased by the maximum of `diff1` and `diff2`. Otherwise, `tp1` and `tp2` are updated based on the comparison of `diff1` and `diff2`, and `ans` is increased by the minimum of `diff1` and `diff2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max_heap` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, `tp1` and `tp2` are updated based on the comparison of `diff1` and `diff2`, `ans` is the updated sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the elements of `b` which are closest to them, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, `item` is the second smallest tuple in the `max_heap` list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `ans` is updated by adding the minimum of `diff1` and `diff2`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated by subtracting the value of the second smallest tuple in the `max_heap` list, and `tp1` is incremented by 1 if `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, otherwise `tp1` is updated based on the comparison of `diff1` and `diff2`, and `tp2` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max_heap` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, `tp1` and `tp2` are updated based on the comparison of `diff1` and `diff2`, `ans` is the updated sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the elements of `b` which are closest to them, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, `item` is the smallest tuple in the `max_heap` list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is incremented by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is incremented by `diff2`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, `tp1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is decremented by the value of the smallest tuple in the `max_heap` list.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
