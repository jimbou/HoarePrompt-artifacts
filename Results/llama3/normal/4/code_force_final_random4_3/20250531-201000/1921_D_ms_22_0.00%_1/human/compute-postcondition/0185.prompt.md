Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is an empty list, b is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 2 fewer inputs: two space-separated lists of integers, i is the last element in the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b, max_heap contains n tuples: one with the negative value of diff1, the value of i, and 0 if diff1 is greater than diff2, otherwise it contains one tuple with the negative value of diff2, the value of i, and m - 1, and another tuple with the negative value of diff1, the value of i, and 0 if diff1 is greater than diff2, otherwise it contains one tuple with the negative value of diff2, the value of i, and m - 1, and so on until all elements in a have been processed, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, and ans is 0.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is not empty, b is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 2 fewer inputs: two space-separated lists of integers, i is the last element in the list a, max_heap contains n - 1 tuples, item is the tuple with the maximum value in max_heap. If item[2] is less than tp1 or greater than tp2, then if the absolute difference between item[1] and the first element of b is greater than the absolute difference between item[1] and the last element of b, tp1 is 1, tp2 is m - 1, and ans is equal to the original value of diff1. Otherwise, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 2, and ans is diff2. If item[2] is not less than tp1 and not greater than tp2, then ans is -item[0]. If item[2] is equal to tp1, then tp1 is 1. Otherwise, tp1 is 0 and tp2 is m - 2.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `stdin`, `i`, `item`, `ans`, `tp1`, `tp2` are variables. `t` is either 0 or 1. `n` is greater than 0. `m` is an integer. `a` is not empty. `b` is a sorted list of integers. `stdin` contains 0 inputs. `i` is the last element in the list `a`. `item` is the tuple with the second maximum value in `max_heap`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `ans` is incremented by the original value of `diff1` if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, or `ans` is incremented by the original value of `diff2` otherwise. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `t` is 1 and `ans` is increased by the negative of the first element of `item`. If `item[2]` is not equal to `tp1`, then `t` is 0, `tp2` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by the negative of the first element of `item`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is either 0, 1 or 2. `n` is greater than 0. `m` is an integer. `a` is not empty. `b` is a sorted list of integers. `stdin` contains 0 inputs. `i` is the last element in the list `a`. `item` is the tuple with the maximum value in `max_heap`. `max_heap` is not empty but has one less element than before. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is incremented by the original value of `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is one less than its original value and `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the element at index `tp2` in `b`. If `item[2]` is not less than `tp1` and not greater than `tp2`, then `ans` is increased by the negation of the first element of `item`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `t` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `t` is either 0 or 1 and `tp2` is decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
