Output State: **t is greater than 0 but 1 less than its original value, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, b is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 2 fewer inputs: two space-separated lists of integers, i is the second element in the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the last element of b, max_heap contains one tuple with the negative value of diff1, the value of i, and 0 if diff1 is greater than diff2, otherwise it contains one tuple with the negative value of diff2, the value of i, and m - 1, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, and ans is 0.**

The code snippet updates the values of `diff1` and `diff2` based on the absolute differences between the second element of `a` and the first and last elements of `b`, respectively. The values of `diff1` and `diff2` are recalculated using the current values of `i`, `b[0]`, and `b[m - 1]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
