Postcondition: ***t is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is not empty, b is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 2 fewer inputs: two space-separated lists of integers, i is the last element in the list a, max_heap contains n - 1 tuples, item is the tuple with the maximum value in max_heap. If item[2] is less than tp1 or greater than tp2, then if the absolute difference between item[1] and the first element of b is greater than the absolute difference between item[1] and the last element of b, tp1 is 1, tp2 is m - 1, and ans is equal to the original value of diff1. Otherwise, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 2, and ans is diff2. If item[2] is not less than tp1 and not greater than tp2, then ans is -item[0]. If item[2] is equal to tp1, then tp1 is 1. Otherwise, tp1 is 0 and tp2 is m - 2.***
