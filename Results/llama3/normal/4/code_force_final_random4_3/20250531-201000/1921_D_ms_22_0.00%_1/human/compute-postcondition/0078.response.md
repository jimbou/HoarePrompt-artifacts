To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `i` and the list `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the list `a` to iterate over. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the second element in the list `a`, and `a` must have at least 2 integers.

For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 3 integers, and `i` should be the third element in the list `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max_heap` is a list containing two tuples, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the third element in the list `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and the last element of `b`. If `diff1 > diff2`, `max_heap` contains two tuples. Otherwise, `max_heap` also contains two tuples.**
