To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `i`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first element in the list `a`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be the next element in the list `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max_heap` is a list containing one tuple, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the second element in the list `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. If the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `b` is greater than the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the last element of `b`, then `max_heap` contains the tuple (-diff1, i, 0). Otherwise, `max_heap` contains the tuple (-diff2, i, `m - 1`).**
