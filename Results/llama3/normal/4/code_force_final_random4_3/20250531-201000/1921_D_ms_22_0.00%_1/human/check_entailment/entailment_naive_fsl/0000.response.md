Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the total difference D. The issue lies in the way it uses a max heap to store the differences between elements of array a and the smallest and largest elements of array b. The program pushes the differences into the heap along with the corresponding element from array a and its index in array b. However, when popping elements from the heap, it does not correctly handle the case when the popped element's index is not within the current range [tp1, tp2]. In such cases, it recalculates the differences with the current tp1 and tp2, which is not the optimal approach.

A correct approach would be to sort both arrays a and b, and then iterate through array a from both ends (smallest and largest elements) and match them with the corresponding elements in array b (largest and smallest elements respectively) to maximize the total difference D.

Here is a correct implementation:

```python
def func():
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
            a = list(map(int, input().split()))
            b = list(map(int, input().split()))
            a.sort()
            b.sort()
            ans = 0
            i, j = 0, n - 1
            k, l = 0, m - 1
            while i <= j:
                if abs(a[i] - b[l]) > abs(a[j] - b[k]):
                    ans += abs(a[i] - b[l])
                    i += 1
                    l -= 1
                else:
                    ans += abs(a[j] - b[k])
                    j -= 1
                    k += 1
            print(ans)
```

This implementation correctly maximizes the total difference D by matching the smallest and largest elements of array a with the largest and smallest elements of array b respectively.
