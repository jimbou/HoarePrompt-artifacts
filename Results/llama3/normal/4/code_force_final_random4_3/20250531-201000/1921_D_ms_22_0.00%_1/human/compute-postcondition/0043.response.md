Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, n is greater than 0, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list with one element, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is a list containing at least one tuple either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 1), tp1 is either 0 or 1, tp2 is either m - 2 or m - 3, ans is either diff1 + diff2 or 2 * diff2, i is the last element of the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the last element of b, item is the maximum tuple from the heap, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `tp2` has been decremented by 1, and the value of `ans` has been incremented by `diff2`. The values of `tp1`, `i`, `diff1`, `diff2`, and `item` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, as no input operations were performed.
