Output State: **`t` is either 0 or 1. `n` is greater than 0. `m` is an integer. `a` is not empty. `b` is a sorted list of integers. `stdin` contains 0 inputs. `i` is the last element in the list `a`. `item` is the tuple with the maximum value in `max_heap`. `max_heap` is not empty but has one less element than before. `ans` is increased by the negation of the first element of `item`. `tp2` is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their previous values and properties, except for `tp2`, which has been decremented by 1. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.
