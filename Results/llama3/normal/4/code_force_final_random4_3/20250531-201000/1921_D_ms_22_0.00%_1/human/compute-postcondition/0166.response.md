Output State: **t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is not empty, b is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 0 inputs, i is the last element in the list a, item is the tuple with the second maximum value in max_heap, tp1 is incremented by 1, diff1 is the absolute difference between the second value in item and the element at the new index tp1 in b, ans is incremented by the original value of diff1, diff2 is the absolute difference between the second value in item and the element at index tp2 in b.**

In this output state, the value of tp1 has been incremented by 1, and the value of ans has been incremented by the original value of diff1. The value of diff1 has also been updated to reflect the new index tp1 in list b. All other variables remain unchanged.
