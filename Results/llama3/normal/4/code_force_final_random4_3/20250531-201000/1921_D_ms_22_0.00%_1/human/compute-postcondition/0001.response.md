Output State: **The program is being run as the main module, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines: the first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5), the second line contains n space-separated integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), and the third line contains m space-separated integers b_i (1 <= b_i <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 100 inclusive. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with three lines of input as described in the initial state. The values of the other variables are not affected.
