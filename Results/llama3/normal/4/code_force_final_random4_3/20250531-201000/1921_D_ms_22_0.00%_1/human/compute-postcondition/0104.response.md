Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, n is an integer, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, tp1 is incremented by 1, tp2 is unchanged, ans is the updated sum of the absolute differences between the elements of a and the elements of b which are closest to them plus diff1, i is the last element in the list a, item is the second smallest tuple in the max_heap list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, diff1 is the absolute difference between the second element of the second smallest tuple in max_heap and the element in b at the updated index tp1, diff2 is unchanged.**

In this final state, the value of `tp1` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `diff1` to it. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of `tp1` is now one more than its original value, and the value of `ans` is the original sum of absolute differences plus `diff1`. All other variables retain their original values and properties as specified in the initial state.
