To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the condition that allows the loop to execute. The loop condition is `while max_heap:`, which means the loop will execute as long as `max_heap` is not empty.

Given the state right before the loop, we need to adjust the state of `max_heap` to ensure it is not empty. The current state of `max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples, but it does not guarantee that `max_heap` is not empty.

To adjust the state, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0, so that `max_heap` is guaranteed to have at least one element.

State: **t is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, n must be greater than 0, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is an empty list, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is a list containing n tuples either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 1), tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the last element of the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between i and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between i and the last element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**
