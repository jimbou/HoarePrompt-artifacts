Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, n is an integer, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is a list containing two tuples, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the second element in the list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, diff1 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the last element of b.**

In this output state, the value of max_heap has been updated to contain two tuples, where the newly added tuple is (-diff2, i, m - 1). The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
