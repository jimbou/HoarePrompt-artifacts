Output State: **t is either 0 or 1, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is not empty, b is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 0 inputs, i is the last element in the list a, item is the tuple with the maximum value in max_heap, max_heap is not empty but has one less element than before, tp1 is incremented by 1, diff1 is the absolute difference between the second element of item and the element at index tp1 in b, ans is incremented by the original value of diff1, diff2 is the absolute difference between the second element of item and the element at index tp2 in b.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `stdin`, `i`, `item`, `max_heap`, `diff2` remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of `tp1` is incremented by 1, and the value of `ans` is incremented by the original value of `diff1`. The value of `diff1` is updated to be the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the element at the new index `tp1` in `b`.
