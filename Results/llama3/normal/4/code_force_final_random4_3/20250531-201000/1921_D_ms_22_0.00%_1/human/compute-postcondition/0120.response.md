Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max_heap` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, `tp1` is updated based on the comparison of `diff1` and `diff2`, `tp2` is decreased by 1, `ans` is the updated sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the elements of `b` which are closest to them minus the value of the smallest tuple in the `max_heap` list, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, `item` is the smallest tuple in the `max_heap` list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `tp2` has been decreased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `tp2` is now one less than its previous value, but its exact value is still unknown. The rest of the variables maintain their initial conditions, including the ranges of `t`, `m`, and the properties of lists `a`, `b`, and `max_heap`.
