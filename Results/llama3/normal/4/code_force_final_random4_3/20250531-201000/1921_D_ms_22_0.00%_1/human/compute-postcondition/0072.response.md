Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, n is an integer, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is a list containing one tuple, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the first element in the list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, then max_heap contains the tuple (-diff1, i, 0). Otherwise, max_heap contains the tuple (-diff2, i, m - 1).***
