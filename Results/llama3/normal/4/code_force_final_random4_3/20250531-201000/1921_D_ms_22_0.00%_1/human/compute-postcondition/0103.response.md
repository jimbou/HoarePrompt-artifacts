Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, n is an integer, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, tp1 and tp2 are updated based on the comparison of diff1 and diff2, ans is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of a and the elements of b which are closest to them, i is the last element in the list a, item is the second smallest tuple in the max_heap list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, diff1 is the absolute difference between the second element of the second smallest tuple in max_heap and the element in b at index tp1, diff2 is the absolute difference between the second element of the second smallest tuple in max_heap and the element in b at index tp2.**

The code snippet calculates the absolute differences between the second element of the second smallest tuple in `max_heap` and the elements in `b` at indices `tp1` and `tp2`, and assigns these differences to `diff1` and `diff2`, respectively. The values of `tp1` and `tp2` are updated based on the comparison of `diff1` and `diff2`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
