Postcondition: **t is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is not empty, b is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 2 fewer inputs: two space-separated lists of integers, i is the last element in the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the last element of b, max_heap contains n - 1 tuples, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, and item is the tuple with the maximum value in max_heap. The current value of diff1 is greater than diff2.**
