Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is not empty, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains 2 fewer inputs: two space-separated lists of integers, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, `max_heap` contains `n - 1` tuples, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 2`, `ans` is `-item[0]`, and the value of `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` (inclusive) but not equal to `tp1`**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values except for `tp2`, which has been decremented by 1, resulting in `tp2` being `m - 2`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.
