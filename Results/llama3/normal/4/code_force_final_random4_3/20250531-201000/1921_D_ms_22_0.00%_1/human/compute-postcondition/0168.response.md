Postcondition: ***t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is not empty, b is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 0 inputs, i is the last element in the list a, item is the tuple with the second maximum value in max_heap. If diff1 > diff2, tp1 is incremented by 1, diff1 is the absolute difference between the second value in item and the element at the new index tp1 in b, ans is incremented by the original value of diff1, and diff2 remains the absolute difference between the second value in item and the element at index tp2 in b. Otherwise, tp2 is one less than its original value, ans is increased by the original value of diff2, and diff2 is the absolute difference between the second value in item and the element at index tp2-1 in b.***
