Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, n is an integer, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is a list containing one tuple, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the second element in the list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, diff1 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the last element of b.**

The code calculates the absolute differences between the second element of list `a` and the first and last elements of list `b`, and assigns these differences to `diff1` and `diff2`, respectively. No other variables are affected by the code.
