To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition, which is `while max_heap:`. This loop will execute as long as `max_heap` is not empty.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `t` is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive
- `n` is an integer
- `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive
- `a` is a list of integers
- `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive
- `max_heap` is a list containing `len(a)` tuples
- `tp1` is 0
- `tp2` is `m - 1`
- `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the elements of `b` which are closest to them
- `i` is the last element in the list `a`
- `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one

The only variable in the loop head is `max_heap`. For the loop to execute at least once, `max_heap` must not be empty. Therefore, the state of `max_heap` needs to be adjusted to ensure it contains at least one element.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max_heap` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the elements of `b` which are closest to them, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one**
