Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max_heap` is a list containing one tuple (-diff2, i, m - 1), `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first element of the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`.**

The code pushes a tuple containing the negative value of `diff2`, `i`, and `m - 1` onto the `max_heap` list. The negative value of `diff2` is used because Python's `heapq` module implements a min heap, and we want to simulate a max heap. The `max_heap` list now contains one tuple with the negative value of `diff2` as the first element, `i` as the second element, and `m - 1` as the third element. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
