Postcondition: **t is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, n is an integer, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the first element in the list a, the current value of diff1 is greater than the current value of diff2, where diff1 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, and diff2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**
