Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, n is an integer, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, tp1 is updated based on the comparison of diff1 and diff2, tp2 is one less than its original value, ans is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of a and the elements of b which are closest to them plus diff2, i is the last element in the list a, item is the second smallest tuple in the max_heap list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, diff1 is the absolute difference between the second element of the second smallest tuple in max_heap and the element in b at index tp1, diff2 is the absolute difference between the second element of the second smallest tuple in max_heap and the element in b at index tp2.**

The code snippet modifies the values of tp2 and ans. The first line decrements tp2 by 1, and the second line adds diff2 to ans. All other variables remain unchanged.
