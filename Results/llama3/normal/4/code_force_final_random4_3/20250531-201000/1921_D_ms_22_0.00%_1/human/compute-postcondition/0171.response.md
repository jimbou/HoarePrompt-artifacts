Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is not empty, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains 2 fewer inputs: two space-separated lists of integers, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, `item` is the tuple with the second maximum value in `max_heap`, `ans` is increased by the negative of the first element of `item`, `tp2` is decreased by 1**

In this output state, the value of `tp2` has been decreased by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `tp2` was previously defined is still valid, but its value has been updated.
