Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, n is greater than 0, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list with one element, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is a list containing at least one tuple either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 1), tp1 is either 1, 2 or 3, tp2 is either m - 1, m - 2 or m - 3, ans is either diff1 + diff2, 2 * diff1 + diff2, diff1 + 2 * diff2 or 3 * diff1 or 3 * diff2, i is the last element of the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the last element of b, item is the maximum tuple from the heap, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code increments `tp1` by 1 and adds `diff1` to `ans`. The value of `tp1` can now be 1, 2, or 3, and the value of `ans` is either `diff1 + diff2`, `2 * diff1 + diff2`, `diff1 + 2 * diff2`, `3 * diff1`, or `3 * diff2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
