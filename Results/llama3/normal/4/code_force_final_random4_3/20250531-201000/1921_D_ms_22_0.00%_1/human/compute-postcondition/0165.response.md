Output State: **t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is not empty, b is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 0 inputs, i is the last element in the list a, item is the tuple with the second maximum value in max_heap, diff1 is the absolute difference between the second value in item and the element at index tp1 in b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the second value in item and the element at index tp2 in b.**

The code snippet calculates the absolute differences between the second value in the tuple `item` and the elements at indices `tp1` and `tp2` in the sorted list `b`, and assigns these differences to `diff1` and `diff2`, respectively. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `stdin`, `i`, and `item` remain unchanged.
