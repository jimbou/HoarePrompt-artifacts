Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is not empty, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains 2 fewer inputs: two space-separated lists of integers, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, `max_heap` contains `n - 1` tuples, `tp1` is 1, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `-item[0]`, and the value of `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`**

In this output state, the value of `tp1` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `item[2]` is still equal to `tp1`, which is now 1.
