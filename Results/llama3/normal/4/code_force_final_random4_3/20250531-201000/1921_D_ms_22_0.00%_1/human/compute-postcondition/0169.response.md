Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is not empty, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains 2 fewer inputs: two space-separated lists of integers, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, `item` is the tuple with the second maximum value in `max_heap`, `ans` is increased by the negative of the first element of `item`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated by adding the negative of the first element of the tuple `item`, which contains the second maximum value in the `max_heap`. The other variables remain unchanged.
