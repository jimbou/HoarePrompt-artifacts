Output State: **t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is not empty, b is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 0 inputs, i is the last element in the list a, item is the tuple with the second maximum value in max_heap, diff1 is the absolute difference between the second value in item and the element at index tp1 in b, tp2 is one less than its original value, ans is increased by the original value of diff2, diff2 is the absolute difference between the second value in item and the element at index tp2-1 in b.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `stdin`, `i`, `item`, and `diff1` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `tp2` is decremented by 1, and the value of `ans` is increased by the original value of `diff2`. The value of `diff2` is updated to be the absolute difference between the second value in `item` and the element at index `tp2-1` in `b`.
