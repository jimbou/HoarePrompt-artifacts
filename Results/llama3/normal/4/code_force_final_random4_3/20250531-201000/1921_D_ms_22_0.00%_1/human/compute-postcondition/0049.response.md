Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list with one element, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max_heap` is a list containing at least one tuple either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 1), `tp1` is either 0, 1 or 2, `tp2` is either m - 1, m - 2 or m - 3, `ans` is either diff1, diff2, diff1 + diff2 or 2 * diff1 or 2 * diff2, `i` is the last element of the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, `item` is the maximum tuple from the heap, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the maximum tuple from the heap has been removed. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `tp1` and `tp2` are updated to either 0, 1 or 2 and either m - 1, m - 2 or m - 3 respectively. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to either `diff1 + diff2` or 2 * `diff1` or 2 * `diff2`.***
