Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list with one element, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max_heap` is a list containing at least one tuple either (-diff1, i, 0) or (-diff2, i, m - 1), `tp1` is either 1, 2 or 3, `tp2` is either m - 1, m - 2 or m - 3, `ans` is either diff1 + (-item[0]), diff2 + (-item[0]), diff1 + diff2 + (-item[0]), 2 * diff1 + (-item[0]) or 2 * diff2 + (-item[0]), `i` is the last element of the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, `item` is the maximum tuple from the heap, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `tp1` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 1, 2, or 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
