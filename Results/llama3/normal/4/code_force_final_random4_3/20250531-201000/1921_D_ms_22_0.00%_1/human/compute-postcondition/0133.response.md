Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `max_heap` is a list containing one tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, stdin contains 2 fewer inputs: two space-separated lists of integers, `i` is the first element in the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `b`, and the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 0 but 1 less than its original value. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `i`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged. The `max_heap` list now contains a tuple with the negative value of `diff2`, the first element of `a`, and `m - 1`. The stdin still contains two fewer inputs. The relationship between `diff1` and `diff2` remains the same.
