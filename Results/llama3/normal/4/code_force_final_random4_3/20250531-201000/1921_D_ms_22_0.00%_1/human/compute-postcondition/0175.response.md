Output State: **`t` is either 0 or 1. `n` is greater than 0. `m` is an integer. `a` is not empty. `b` is a sorted list of integers. `stdin` contains 0 inputs. `i` is the last element in the list `a`. `item` is the tuple with the maximum value in `max_heap`. `max_heap` is not empty but has one less element than before.**

The value of `item` is updated to the tuple with the maximum value in `max_heap` after popping it from the heap. The size of `max_heap` is reduced by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.
