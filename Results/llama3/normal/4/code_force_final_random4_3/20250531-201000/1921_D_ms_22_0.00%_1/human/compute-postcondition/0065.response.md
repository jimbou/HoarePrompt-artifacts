Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive, n is an integer, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the last element of the list a, diff1 is the absolute difference between i and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between i and the last element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the sum of the absolute differences between the last element of a and the elements of b which is ans is being printed**

The code block modifies the initial state in the following ways:

*   The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so it is now an integer between 0 and 98 inclusive.
*   The values of `n` and `m` are updated based on the input from stdin. `n` is now an integer, and `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 \* 10^5 inclusive.
*   The list `a` is updated with a new list of integers from stdin.
*   The list `b` is updated with a new sorted list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive from stdin.
*   The list `max_heap` is reset to an empty list.
*   The values of `tp1` and `tp2` are reset to 0 and `m - 1`, respectively.
*   The value of `ans` is reset to 0.
*   The value of `i` is updated to the last element of the list `a`.
*   The values of `diff1` and `diff2` are updated to the absolute differences between `i` and the first and last elements of `b`, respectively.
*   Stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
*   The sum of the absolute differences between the last element of `a` and the elements of `b`, which is `ans`, is being printed.
