Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of yogurts (n), the price of one yogurt (a), and the price of two yogurts on promotion (b).
3. If n is greater than 1, the program calculates two possible costs:
   - ans1: the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * n).
   - ans2: the cost of buying n yogurts with the promotion, which is the cost of buying n/2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (b * n // 2) plus the cost of buying any remaining yogurts at the regular price (a * n % 2).
4. The program then prints the minimum of these two costs using the min() function.
5. If n is 1, the program simply prints the cost of buying one yogurt at the regular price (a).

Correctness: **True**
