Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is an integer between 1 and 30, b is an integer between 1 and 30, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t-3 (0 <= t-3 <= 10^4-3), each of the following t-3 lines contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). If n > 1, the minimum of a times n and b times n divided by 2 plus a times n modulo 2 is printed. If n is 1, the value of a is printed.***
