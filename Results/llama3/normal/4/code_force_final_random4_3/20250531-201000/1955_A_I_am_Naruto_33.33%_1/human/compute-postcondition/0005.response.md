The code prints the minimum value between `ans1` and `ans2`. Where `ans1` is the product of `a` and `n`, and `ans2` is the integer division of the product of `b` and `n` by 2 plus the product of `a` and the remainder of the division of `n` by 2.

Output: **n is an integer between 2 and 100, a is an integer between 1 and 30, b is an integer between 1 and 30, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 10^4-1), each of the following t-1 lines contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), ans1 is an integer equal to a * n, ans2 is an integer equal to b * n // 2 + a * n % 2, and the minimum value between ans1 and ans2 is being printed**
