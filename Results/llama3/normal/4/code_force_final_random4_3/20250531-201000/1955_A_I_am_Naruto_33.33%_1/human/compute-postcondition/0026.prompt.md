Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). Each of the following t lines contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if n > 1:
        ans1 = a * n
        ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
        print(min(ans1, ans2))
    else:
        print(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 10^4-1), each of the following t-1 lines contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). If `n` is greater than 1, the minimum value between `a * n` and `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` is printed. If `n` is equal to 1, the value of `a` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t-3 (0 <= t-3 <= 10^4-3), each of the following t-3 lines contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). If `n` is larger than 1, the minimum value between `a` times `n` and `b` times `n` divided by 2 plus `a` times `n` modulo 2 is being printed. If `n` is 1, the value of `a` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is an integer between 1 and 30, b is an integer between 1 and 30, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t-3 (0 <= t-3 <= 10^4-3), each of the following t-3 lines contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). If n > 1, the minimum of a times n and b times n divided by 2 plus a times n modulo 2 is printed. If n is 1, the value of a is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
