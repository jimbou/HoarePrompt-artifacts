The only object in the loop head is variable  _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If the variable _ is less than the value of the expression int(input()), the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, the variable _ is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 10^4-1), each of the following t-1 lines contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). So for the loop to be executed one more time the variable _ is 1 and stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t-2 (0 <= t-2 <= 10^4-2), each of the following t-2 lines contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30).
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t-2 (0 <= t-2 <= 10^4-2), each of the following t-2 lines contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30)**
