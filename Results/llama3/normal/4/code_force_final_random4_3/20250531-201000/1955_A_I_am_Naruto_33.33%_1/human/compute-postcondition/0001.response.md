Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 10^4-1), each of the following t-1 lines contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30)**.

In natural language, the output state is: The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` have been assigned values from the first line of input, which contains three integers. The value of `n` is between 1 and 100, and the values of `a` and `b` are between 1 and 30. The variable `_` remains 0. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but the first line has been consumed. The remaining lines contain the same type of input, with the first line containing a single integer t-1, and each of the following t-1 lines containing three integers.
