The code prints the minimum value between `ans1` and `ans2`. 

`ans1` is an integer equal to `a` multiplied by `n`, where `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 100.

`ans2` is an integer equal to `b` multiplied by `n` divided by 2 plus `a` multiplied by the remainder of `n` divided by 2, where `b` is an integer between 1 and 30.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `ans1` and `ans2`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the minimum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.

Output: **min(a*n, b*n//2 + a*n%2) (where a is an integer between 1 and 30, b is an integer between 1 and 30, and n is an integer between 2 and 100)**
