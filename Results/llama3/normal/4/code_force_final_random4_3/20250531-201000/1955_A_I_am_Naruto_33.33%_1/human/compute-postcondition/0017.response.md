Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t-3 (0 <= t-3 <= 10^4-3), each of the following t-3 lines contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). If `n` is larger than 1, the minimum value between `a` times `n` and `b` times `n` divided by 2 plus `a` times `n` modulo 2 is being printed. If `n` is 1, the value of `a` is being printed.***
