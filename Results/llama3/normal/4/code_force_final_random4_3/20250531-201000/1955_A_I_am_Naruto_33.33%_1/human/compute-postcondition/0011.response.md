Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t-3 (0 <= t-3 <= 10^4-3), each of the following t-3 lines contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30)**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` have been updated to the values read from the first line of the input, which contains three integers. The value of `_` remains unchanged. The stdin now contains one less line of input, as the first line has been read and processed. The remaining lines of input still contain the same number of integers, but the total number of lines has decreased by one.
