The code prints the minimum value between `ans1` and `ans2`. Where `ans1` is the product of `a` and `n`, and `ans2` is the product of `b` and `n` divided by 2 plus the remainder of the product of `a` and `n` divided by 2.
Output: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is an integer between 1 and 30, b is an integer between 1 and 30, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t-3 (0 <= t-3 <= 10^4-3), each of the following t-3 lines contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), ans1 is an integer equal to a times n, ans2 is an integer equal to b times n divided by 2 plus a times n modulo 2, and the minimum value between ans1 and ans2 is being printed**
