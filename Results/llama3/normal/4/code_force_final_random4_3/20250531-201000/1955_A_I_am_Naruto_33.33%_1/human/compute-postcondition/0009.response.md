Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 10^4-1), each of the following t-1 lines contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). If `n` is greater than 1, the minimum value between `a * n` and `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` is printed. If `n` is equal to 1, the value of `a` is printed.**
