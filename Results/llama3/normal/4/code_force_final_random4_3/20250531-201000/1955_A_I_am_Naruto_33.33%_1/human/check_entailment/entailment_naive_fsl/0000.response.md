Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. It considers two cases: buying all yogurts at the regular price (a * n) and buying yogurts in pairs at the promotion price (b * n // 2 + a * n % 2). The program then prints the minimum of these two values.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

*   If n is 1, it simply prints the price of one yogurt (a).
*   If n is greater than 1, it calculates the minimum cost by comparing the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price and the cost of buying yogurts in pairs at the promotion price.

The program does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it does not handle. It correctly implements the problem description and provides the expected output for all possible inputs.
