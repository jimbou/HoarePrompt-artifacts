Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 10^4-1), each of the following t-1 lines contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), and the current value of `n` is greater than 1.**
