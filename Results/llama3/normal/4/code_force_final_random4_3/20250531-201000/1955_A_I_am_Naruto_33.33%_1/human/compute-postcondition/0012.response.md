Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is an integer between 1 and 30, b is an integer between 1 and 30, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t-3 (0 <= t-3 <= 10^4-3), each of the following t-3 lines contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), ans1 is an integer equal to a times n, ans2 is an integer equal to b times n divided by 2 plus a times n modulo 2.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `_` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, with the first line having a single integer `t-3` and the following lines having three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. The code introduces two new variables, `ans1` and `ans2`, which are calculated based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `n`. `ans1` is the product of `a` and `n`, while `ans2` is calculated by multiplying `b` by `n` and dividing by 2, then adding the remainder of `a` times `n` divided by 2.
