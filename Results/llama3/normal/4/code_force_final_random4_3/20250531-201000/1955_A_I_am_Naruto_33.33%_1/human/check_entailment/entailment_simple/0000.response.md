Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program iterates over each test case, reads the values of n, a, and b, and calculates the minimum cost.

The program correctly handles the case when n is 1 by printing the value of a, as there is no promotion for buying a single yogurt.

For n greater than 1, the program calculates two possible costs: ans1, which is the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * n), and ans2, which is the cost of buying n yogurts using the promotion (b * n // 2 + a * n % 2). The program then prints the minimum of these two costs.

The calculation of ans2 is correct, as it takes into account the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price (b * n // 2) and the remaining yogurts that need to be bought at the regular price (a * n % 2).

Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost of buying n yogurts.

Correctness: **True**
