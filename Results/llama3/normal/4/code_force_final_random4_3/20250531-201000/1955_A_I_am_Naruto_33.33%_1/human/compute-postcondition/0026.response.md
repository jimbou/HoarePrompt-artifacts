Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, `_` is t-1, stdin is empty. If `n` is greater than 1, the minimum value between `a * n` and `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` is printed. If `n` is equal to 1, the value of `a` is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all the iterations specified by the initial value of `t`. The loop variable `_` has reached its final value of `t-1`, and the input from `stdin` has been fully consumed, leaving it empty. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain within their specified ranges, and the loop's conditional logic continues to determine whether to print the minimum value between `a * n` and `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` or the value of `a` alone, depending on the value of `n`.
