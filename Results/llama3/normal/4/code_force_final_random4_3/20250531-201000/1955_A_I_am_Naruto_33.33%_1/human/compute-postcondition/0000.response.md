The only objects in the loop head are variables `_` and `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). Each of the following t lines contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). So for the loop to be executed the input must be at least 1 and `_` is 0.
