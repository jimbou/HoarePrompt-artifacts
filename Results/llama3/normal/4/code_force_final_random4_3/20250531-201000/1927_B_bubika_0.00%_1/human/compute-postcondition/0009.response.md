Output State: **a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the value at index x is equal to the number of times x appears in s and all other values are 0, n is an integer greater than 0, s is a list of integers, i is the last integer in the list s, r is a string containing the x-th letter of the alphabet repeated for each occurrence of x in s, t is 0, stdin is empty**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is:

The string 'a' remains unchanged, the list 'b' now contains the frequency of each integer in 's', 'n' is still an integer greater than 0, 's' is still a list of integers, 'i' is now the last integer in 's', 'r' is a string containing the x-th letter of the alphabet repeated for each occurrence of x in 's', 't' is still 0, and 'stdin' is still empty.
