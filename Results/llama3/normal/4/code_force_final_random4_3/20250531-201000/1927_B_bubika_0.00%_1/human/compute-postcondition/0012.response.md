To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for t in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved in the loop head are `t` and `input()`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is 0, and `input()` is empty.

For the loop to execute again, `t` needs to be incremented by 1, and `input()` needs to be non-empty.

So, the adjusted states are:

* `t` is 1
* `input()` is non-empty

The other variables `a`, `b`, `n`, `s`, `i`, `r`, and `stdin` are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 integers where the value at index x is equal to the number of times x appears in s and all other values are 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers, `i` is the last integer in the list s, `r` is a string containing the x-th letter of the alphabet repeated for each occurrence of x in s, `t` is 1, `stdin` is non-empty, and the string `r` containing the x-th letter of the alphabet repeated for each occurrence of x in s is being printed**
