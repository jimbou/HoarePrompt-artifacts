Output State: **a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the value at index x is equal to the number of times x appears in s and the value at index x is increased by the number of times x appears in s, n is an integer greater than 0, s is a list of integers, i is the last integer in the list s, r is a string containing the character at index x of string a repeated the number of times x appears in s, t is 1, stdin is empty**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is:

The string 'a' remains unchanged. The list 'b' now contains the correct count of each integer in the list 's'. The integer 'n' remains greater than 0. The list 's' remains unchanged. The integer 'i' is now the last integer in the list 's'. The string 'r' contains the characters from 'a' repeated the number of times they appear in 's'. The integer 't' remains 1. The stdin remains empty.
