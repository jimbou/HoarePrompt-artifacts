Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n) representing the trace of the lost string.
    a = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    b = [0] * 26
    for t in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        r = ''
        
        for i in s:
            x = b.index(i)
            r += a[x]
            b[x] += 1
        
        print(r)
        
    #State: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the value at index x is equal to the number of times x appears in s, n is an integer greater than 0, s is a list of integers that must have at least n elements, i is the nth integer in the list s, r is a string containing the character at the index of the nth integer in the list s in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' plus the character at the index of the (n-1)th integer in the list s in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' plus the character at the index of the (n-2)th integer in the list s in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' plus ... plus the character at the index of the 1st integer in the list s in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', t is n, stdin is empty, and the string r is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers representing a trace of a lost string. It then reconstructs the original string by mapping each integer to its corresponding character in the alphabet, based on the frequency of each integer in the list. The reconstructed string is then printed to the console. The function processes all test cases and empties the standard input.
