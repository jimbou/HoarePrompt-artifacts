To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects in it accordingly.


The loop head is `for i in s:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `s`.


At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the first integer in the list `s`. For the loop to execute again, `s` must have at least two integers, and `i` must be the second integer in the list.


State: **`a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 integers where the value at index x is equal to the number of times x appears in s and all other values are 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list `s`, `r` is a string containing the character at index x of string `a`, `t` is 1, `stdin` is empty**
