Output State: **a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the value at index x is equal to the number of times x appears in s and the value at index x is increased by the number of times x appears in s plus the number of times x appears in s, n is an integer greater than 0, s is a list of integers that must have at least n elements, i is the nth integer in the list s, r is a string containing the character at the index of the nth integer in the list s in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' plus the character at the index of the (n-1)th integer in the list s in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' plus the character at the index of the (n-2)th integer in the list s in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' plus ... plus the character at the index of the 1st integer in the list s in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', t is n, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The string 'a' remains unchanged. The list 'b' has been updated such that the value at each index 'x' is equal to the number of times 'x' appears in the list 's', plus the number of times 'x' appears in 's'. The integer 'n' remains greater than 0. The list 's' has at least 'n' elements. The integer 'i' is the last integer in the list 's'. The string 'r' contains the characters at the indices of all integers in the list 's', in the order they appear in 's', repeated 'n' times. The integer 't' is equal to 'n'. The standard input 'stdin' remains empty.
