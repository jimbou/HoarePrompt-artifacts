Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 zeros
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    r = ''
    for i in s:
        x = b.index(i)
        r += a[x]
        b[x] += 1
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the value at index x is equal to the number of times x appears in s and all other values are 0, n is an integer greater than 0, s is a list of integers, i is the last integer in the list s, r is a string containing the x-th letter of the alphabet repeated for each occurrence of x in s, t is 0, stdin is empty, and the string r containing the x-th letter of the alphabet repeated for each occurrence of x in s is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the value at index x is equal to the number of times x appears in s and the value at index x is increased by the number of times x appears in s, n is an integer greater than 0, s is a list of integers, i is the last integer in the list s, r is a string containing the character at index x of string a repeated the number of times x appears in s, t is 1, stdin is empty, and the string r is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the value at index x is equal to the number of times x appears in s and the value at index x is increased by the number of times x appears in s plus the number of times x appears in s, n is an integer greater than 0, s is a list of integers that must have at least n elements, i is the nth integer in the list s, r is a string containing the character at the index of the nth integer in the list s in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' plus the character at the index of the (n-1)th integer in the list s in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' plus the character at the index of the (n-2)th integer in the list s in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' plus ... plus the character at the index of the 1st integer in the list s in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', t is n, stdin is empty, and the string r is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
