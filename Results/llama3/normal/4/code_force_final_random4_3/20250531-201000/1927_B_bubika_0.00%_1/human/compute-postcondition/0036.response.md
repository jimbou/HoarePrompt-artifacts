Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers representing a trace of a lost string. It then reconstructs the original string by mapping each integer to its corresponding character in the alphabet, based on the frequency of each integer in the list. The reconstructed string is then printed to the console. The function processes all test cases and empties the standard input.**
