The only variables in the loop head are variables  t and input(), so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input(). If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' and b is a list of 26 zeros does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to input() is greater than 0 and t is now 0. 
State: **a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 zeros, input() is greater than 0, t is 0**
