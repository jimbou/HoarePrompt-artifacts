Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, `total_water` is equal to the sum of the elements in `a` and is divisible by `n`, `target` is equal to `total_water` divided by `n`, `container` is equal to the third element in `a` minus `target` plus 2 times the third element in the list minus 2 times `target`, `water` is the third element in the list. If `container` is less than 0, the program returns the string 'No'. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
