Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

The program first calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers. If it is not, the program returns 'No'. This is correct because if the total amount of water is not divisible by the number of containers, it is impossible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

Next, the program calculates the target amount of water for each container by dividing the total amount of water by the number of containers. It then iterates over the list of containers, calculating the difference between the current amount of water in each container and the target amount. If at any point the sum of these differences becomes negative, the program returns 'No'. This is correct because if the sum of the differences becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target amount, so it is impossible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

If the program completes the iteration over the list of containers without returning 'No', it returns 'Yes'. This is correct because if the sum of the differences never becomes negative, it means that there is enough water in the previous containers to fill each container to the target amount, so it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
