Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `total_water` is equal to the sum of the elements in `a` and is divisible by `n`, `target` is equal to `total_water` divided by `n`, `container` is equal to the first element in `a` minus `target`, `water` is the first element in the list.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `container` has been updated to be the difference between the first element in the list `a` and the target value, which is the total water divided by the number of elements in the list. The other variables remain unchanged.
