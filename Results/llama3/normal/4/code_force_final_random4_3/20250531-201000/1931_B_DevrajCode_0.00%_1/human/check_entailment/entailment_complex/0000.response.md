Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first checks if the total water is divisible by the number of containers. If it's not, it immediately returns 'No', which is correct because the problem statement guarantees that the sum of a_i is divisible by n.

2. If the total water is divisible by the number of containers, the program calculates the target amount of water each container should have.

3. The program then iterates over the list of water amounts. For each container, it calculates the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount. It adds this difference to the `container` variable.

4. If at any point the `container` variable becomes negative, the program returns 'No'. This is correct because it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target amount.

5. If the program finishes iterating over the list of water amounts without returning 'No', it means that it is possible to distribute the water equally among the containers. In this case, the program returns 'Yes'.

Correctness: **True**
