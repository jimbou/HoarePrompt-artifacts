Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the input data, which includes the number of test cases (n) and the amounts of water in each container (a).

2. The function `func_1(n, a)` is defined to solve the problem. It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers (n). If not, it returns 'No' because it is impossible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

3. If the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, the function calculates the target amount of water for each container.

4. The function then iterates over the amounts of water in each container. For each container, it calculates the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount. This difference is added to a running total (container).

5. If the running total (container) ever becomes negative, the function returns 'No' because it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to make the amount of water in the current container equal to the target amount.

6. If the function iterates over all containers without returning 'No', it returns 'Yes' because it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
