Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `total_water` is equal to the sum of the elements in `a` and is divisible by `n`, `target` is equal to `total_water` divided by `n`. The current value of `container` is less than 0, which means the first element in `a` minus `target` is less than 0. The current value of `water` is the first element in the list. Overall, the program is in a state where the container's capacity is less than the target water level, indicating that the container cannot hold the target amount of water.***
