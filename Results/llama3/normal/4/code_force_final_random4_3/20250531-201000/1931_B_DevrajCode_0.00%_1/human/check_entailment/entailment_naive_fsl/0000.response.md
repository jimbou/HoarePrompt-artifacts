Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. It first checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. If not, it immediately returns 'No', which is correct because it's impossible to distribute the water evenly in this case.

2. Then, it calculates the target amount of water each container should have.

3. It iterates over the containers, keeping track of the total amount of water that needs to be moved to the right (i.e., from a container to a container with a higher index). If at any point this total becomes negative, it means that there's not enough water to move to the right to make the current container have the target amount, so it returns 'No'.

4. If it finishes iterating over the containers without returning 'No', it means that it's possible to distribute the water evenly, so it returns 'Yes'.

This logic is correct because it takes into account the fact that water can only be moved from a container to a container with a higher index, and it checks if there's enough water to move to the right to make each container have the target amount.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where the number of containers is 1, or where the total amount of water is not divisible by the number of containers. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
