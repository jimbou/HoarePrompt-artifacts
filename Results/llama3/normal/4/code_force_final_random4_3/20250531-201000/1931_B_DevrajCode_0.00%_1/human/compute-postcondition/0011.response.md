Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `total_water` is equal to the sum of the elements in `a` and is divisible by `n`, `target` is equal to `total_water` divided by `n`, `container` is equal to the second element in `a` minus `target` plus `water` minus `target`, `water` is the second element in the list. The container is larger than or equal to 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of elements in the list `a` is still a positive integer `n`. The list `a` still contains `n` non-negative integers with at least 2 elements. The total water is still equal to the sum of the elements in `a` and is still divisible by `n`. The target is still equal to the total water divided by `n`. The container is now equal to the second element in `a` minus the target plus the water minus the target. The water is still the second element in the list. The container is still larger than or equal to 0.
