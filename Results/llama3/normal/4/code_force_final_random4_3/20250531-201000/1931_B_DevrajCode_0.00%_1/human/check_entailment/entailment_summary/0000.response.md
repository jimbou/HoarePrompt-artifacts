Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly determines if it is possible to distribute water equally among 'n' containers given a list of 'n' non-negative integers representing the amount of water in each container.

The program first calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers. If it is not, the function immediately returns 'No'. If it is, the program calculates the target amount of water each container should have.

The program then iterates over the list of water amounts, keeping track of the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount. If at any point this difference is negative, the function returns 'No', because it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target amount.

If the function iterates over the entire list without returning 'No', it returns 'Yes', indicating that it is possible to distribute the water equally among the containers.

Correctness: **True**
