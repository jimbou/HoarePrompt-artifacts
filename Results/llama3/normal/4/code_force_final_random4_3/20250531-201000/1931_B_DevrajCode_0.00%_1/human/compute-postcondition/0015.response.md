Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, `total_water` is equal to the sum of the elements in `a` and is divisible by `n`, `target` is equal to `total_water` divided by `n`, `container` is equal to the third element in `a` minus `target` plus 2 times the third element in the list minus 2 times `target`, `water` is the third element in the list.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `container` has been updated to be the third element in the list `a` minus the `target` plus 2 times the third element in the list minus 2 times the `target`. The other variables remain unchanged.
