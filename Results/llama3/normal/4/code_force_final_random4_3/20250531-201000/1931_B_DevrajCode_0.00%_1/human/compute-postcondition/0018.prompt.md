Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers, total_water is equal to the sum of the elements in a and is divisible by n, target is equal to total_water divided by n, container is 0
Code of the loop:
for water in a:
    container += water - target
    if container < 0:
        return 'No'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `total_water` is equal to the sum of the elements in `a` and is divisible by `n`, `target` is equal to `total_water` divided by `n`, `container` is equal to the first element in `a` minus `target`, `water` is the first element in the list. The container is larger than or equal to 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `total_water` is equal to the sum of the elements in `a` and is divisible by `n`, `target` is equal to `total_water` divided by `n`, `container` is equal to the second element in `a` minus `target` plus `water` minus `target`, `water` is the second element in the list. If the container is less than 0, the program returns the string 'No'. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, `total_water` is equal to the sum of the elements in `a` and is divisible by `n`, `target` is equal to `total_water` divided by `n`, `container` is equal to the third element in `a` minus `target` plus 2 times the third element in the list minus 2 times `target`, `water` is the third element in the list. If `container` is less than 0, the program returns the string 'No'. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
