Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `total_water` is equal to the sum of the elements in `a` and is divisible by `n`, `target` is equal to `total_water` divided by `n`, `container` is equal to the sum of all elements in `a` minus `n` times `target`, `water` is the last element in the list. If `container` is less than 0, the program returns the string 'No'. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations, the state of the program is such that the container's value is the sum of all elements in list `a` minus `n` times the target value. The loop has iterated over all elements in list `a`, and the value of `water` is now the last element in the list. If at any point during the iterations the container's value became less than 0, the program would have returned the string 'No'. Otherwise, the program continues without making any further changes.
