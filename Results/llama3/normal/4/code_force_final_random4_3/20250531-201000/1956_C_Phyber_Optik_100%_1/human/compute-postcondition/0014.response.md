The code prints the number 1, the value of `n - j + 1` which is `n`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) in a sequence.
Output: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `sum` is `n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/6`, `stdin` contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0), `i` is `n+1`, `j` is 1, and this is printed: 1, n, and the numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) in a sequence**
