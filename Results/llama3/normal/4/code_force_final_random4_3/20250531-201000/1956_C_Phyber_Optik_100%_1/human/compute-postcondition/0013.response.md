The code prints the number 1, the value of `n - j + 1` (which is `n` because `j` is 1), and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) in a sequence.
Since `n` is an integer greater than 0, the value of `n - j + 1` will always be equal to `n`. The `*range(1, n + 1)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
Output: **1, n, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is an integer greater than 0)**
