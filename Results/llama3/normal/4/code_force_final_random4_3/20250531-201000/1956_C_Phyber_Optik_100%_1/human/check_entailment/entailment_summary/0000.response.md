Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n` and calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix using a formula involving squares and cubes of numbers from 2 to `n`. This formula is correct based on the problem description.
3. The program then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, which is `2n` in this case.
4. The program then prints the operations to achieve the maximum sum. It prints `n` operations of type 1 (row operations) and `n` operations of type 2 (column operations). Each operation is printed with the correct format, including the type, row/column index, and permutation.
5. The permutations printed are correct, as they are simply the range of numbers from 1 to `n`.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, reading input, calculating the sum, and printing the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
