Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n+1`, `sum` is 1 + ∑[(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i] from i=2 to n, `t` is at least 3, `j` is `n+1`, stdin contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0), and this is printed: the value of sum which is 1 + ∑[(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i] from i=2 to n and the value of n+n which is 2n**
