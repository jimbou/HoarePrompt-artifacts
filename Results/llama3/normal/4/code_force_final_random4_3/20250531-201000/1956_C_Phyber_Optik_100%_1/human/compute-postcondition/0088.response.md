Output State: **t is 0, stdin contains no more inputs, n is the last input integer, i is n+1, j is n+1, and sum is 1 + âˆ‘[(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i] from i=2 to n.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of t will be 0 (since it decreases by 1 in each iteration), there will be no more inputs in stdin, n will be the last input integer, i and j will be n+1 (since they are incremented in each iteration), and sum will be the final value calculated in the last iteration of the loop.
