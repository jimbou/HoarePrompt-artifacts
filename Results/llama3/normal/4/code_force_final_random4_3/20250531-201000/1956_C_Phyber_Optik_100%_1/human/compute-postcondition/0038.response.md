Let's analyze the given state and the for loop statement.

The for loop statement is: `for i in range(2, n + 1):`

The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `sum` is 7, `t` is at least 2, `j` is `n`, stdin contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0), and this is printed: 2, 1, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive)

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the loop statement, `i` starts from 2 and goes up to `n` (inclusive). Since `i` is currently 2, it will be incremented to 3 in the next iteration.

The loop will execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Since `n` is at least 2, we can conclude that `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `sum`, `t`, `j`, and stdin are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `sum` is 7, `t` is at least 2, `j` is `n`, stdin contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0), and this is printed: 2, 1, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive)**
