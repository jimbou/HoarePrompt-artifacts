The code prints the number 1, the value of `n - j + 1` (where `n` is at least 2 and `j` is 3), and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
Since `j` is 3, `n - j + 1` is equal to `n - 2`.
The sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is generated by the `range(1, n + 1)` function.
Output: **1, n - 2, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is at least 2)**
