The code `sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` is executed. The value of `i` is 2. 

First, we calculate `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1))`. This is equal to `(2 * 2 - (2 - 1) * (2 - 1))` which is equal to `(4 - 1)` which is equal to `3`.

Then, we multiply `3` by `i` which is `2`. So, `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` is equal to `3 * 2` which is equal to `6`.

Finally, we add `6` to `sum` which is `1`. So, `sum` is now `1 + 6` which is equal to `7`.

The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is at least 2, `sum` is 7, `stdin` contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0), `i` is 2**
