The code prints a sequence of numbers starting with 1, followed by the value of `n - j + 1`, and then a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Here's a breakdown of the values:

* `1` is printed as is.
* `n - j + 1` is calculated using the values of `n` and `j`. Since `n` is at least 2 and `j` is 2, `n - j + 1` will be at least 1. The exact value depends on the value of `n`.
* `*range(1, n + 1)` prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). The `*` operator unpacks the range object into individual arguments to the `print` function.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `n - j + 1`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output a sequence of numbers starting with 1, followed by a value that is at least 1, and then a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Output: **1, (n - j + 1) (where n is at least 2 and j is 2), 1, 2, ..., n (where n is at least 2)**
