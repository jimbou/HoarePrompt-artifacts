Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `sum` is `n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/6`, `stdin` contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0), `i` is `n+1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` remains at least 1, `n` remains an integer greater than 0, `sum` becomes the sum of the squares of the first `n` positive integers, `stdin` still contains zero or more inputs (each an integer greater than 0), and `i` becomes `n+1`.
