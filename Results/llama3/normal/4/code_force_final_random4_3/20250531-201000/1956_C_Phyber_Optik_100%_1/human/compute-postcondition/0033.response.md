Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `sum` is `n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/6`, `stdin` contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0), `i` is `n+1`, `j` is `n`, and this is printed: 2, 1, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `j` has reached the value of `n`, and the last two print statements have printed the values 2 and 1, followed by a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). The values of `t`, `n`, `sum`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
