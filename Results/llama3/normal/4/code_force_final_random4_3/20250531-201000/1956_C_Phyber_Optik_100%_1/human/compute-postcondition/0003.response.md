According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `sum` is 1, and `stdin` contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0). However, these states do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and `i` is now 2.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is at least 2, `sum` is 1, `stdin` contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0), `i` is 2**
