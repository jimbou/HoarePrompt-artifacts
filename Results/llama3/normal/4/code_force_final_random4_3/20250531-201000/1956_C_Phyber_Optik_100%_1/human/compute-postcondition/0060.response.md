Output State: **n is at least 2, i is n+1, sum is (n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) / 6 + 1, t is at least 2, j is n+1, stdin contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0), and this is printed: 2, 1, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive), and the sum which is (n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) / 6 + 1 and 2n are printed**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: the loop has finished executing, and the value of `j` has reached `n+1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `n`, `i`, `sum`, and `t` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop. The input in `stdin` is still an integer greater than 0, and the output includes the final values of the sum and `2n`, which are printed after the loop completes.
