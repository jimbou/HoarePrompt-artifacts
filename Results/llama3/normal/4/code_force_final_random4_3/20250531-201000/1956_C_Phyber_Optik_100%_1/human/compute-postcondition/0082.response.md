Let's analyze the given state and the for loop statement.

The state at the end of the previous iteration is:

* `n` is an integer greater than 0
* `i` is `n+1`
* `sum` is 1 + ∑[(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i] from i=2 to n
* `t` is at least 3
* `j` is 2
* Printed values: 2, n - 2 + 1, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive)

The for loop statement is:
```
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we only consider the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. Since `j` is currently 2, we need to increment it to 3 for the loop to execute again. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n+1`, `sum` is 1 + ∑[(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i] from i=2 to n, `t` is at least 3, `j` is 3**

Note that the values of `i`, `sum`, and `t` remain unchanged, as they are not part of the loop head.
