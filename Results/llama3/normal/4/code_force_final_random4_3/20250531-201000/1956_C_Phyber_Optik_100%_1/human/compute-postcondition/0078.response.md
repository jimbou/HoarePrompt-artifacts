The `print` statement will print a sequence of numbers. The first number is 1. The second number is `n - j + 1`, where `n` is an integer greater than 0 and `j` is 2. So, the second number is `n - 2 + 1`, which simplifies to `n - 1`. The remaining numbers are generated by the `range` function, which produces a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and ending at `n` (inclusive).

Output: **1, n-1, 1, 2, 3, ..., n**
