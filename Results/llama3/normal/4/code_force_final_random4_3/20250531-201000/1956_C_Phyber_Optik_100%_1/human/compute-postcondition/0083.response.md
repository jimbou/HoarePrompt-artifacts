Let's break down the print statement step by step:

1. `1`: This is a literal integer value that will be printed as is.

2. `n - j + 1`: Here, `n` is an integer greater than 0, and `j` is 3. So, this expression will evaluate to `n - 3 + 1`, which simplifies to `n - 2`.

3. `*range(1, n + 1)`: This is a bit more complex. The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n + 1`. The `*` operator unpacks this sequence into separate arguments to the `print` function.

So, when we put it all together, the print statement will output:

* The literal integer `1`
* The value of `n - 2`
* The sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive)

Since we don't know the exact value of `n`, we can't provide a specific numerical output. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output as:

Output: **1, [n-2], 1, 2, 3, ..., [n] (where n is an integer greater than 0)**
