The `print` statement will print the numbers 2, `n - j + 1`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) in a sequence.

Since `j` is 1, `n - j + 1` simplifies to `n`.

The `*range(1, n + 1)` part of the print statement will print the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) in a sequence.

So, the output will be the number 2, the value of `n`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) in a sequence.

Output: **2, n, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is the value of n)**
