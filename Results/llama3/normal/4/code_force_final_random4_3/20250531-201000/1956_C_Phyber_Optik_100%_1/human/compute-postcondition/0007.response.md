The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 4.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is at least 5, `sum` is 22, `stdin` contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0), `i` is 4**
