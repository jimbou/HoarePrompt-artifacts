Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n+1`, `sum` is 1 + ∑[(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i] from i=2 to n, `t` is at least 3, `j` is `n+1`, and this is printed: the value of sum which is 1 + ∑[(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i] from i=2 to n and the value of n+n which is 2n**

The loop has executed all its iterations, and the output state reflects the final values of the variables. The value of `j` has reached `n+1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `n`, `i`, `sum`, and `t` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body. The output includes the final value of `sum` and the value of `n+n`, which is `2n`.
