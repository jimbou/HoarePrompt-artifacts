The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 3, `sum` is 7, `t` is at least 3, `j` is `n+1`, stdin contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0)**
