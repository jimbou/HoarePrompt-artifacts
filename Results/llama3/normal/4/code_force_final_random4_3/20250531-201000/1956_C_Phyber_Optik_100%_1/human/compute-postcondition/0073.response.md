The code prints the value 1, the value of `n - j + 1` which is `n` because `j` is 1, and the values of all integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) because `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n + 1`, effectively covering all integers from 1 to `n`.
Output: **1, n, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is the value of n)**
