According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n+1`, `sum` is 1, `t` is at least 3, `j` is `n+1`, and `stdin` contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0). However, the loop head only contains the variable `n` and `i`. So we can only adjust those ones. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2 and `i` is 2.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `sum` is 1, `t` is at least 3, `j` is `n+1`, stdin contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0)**
