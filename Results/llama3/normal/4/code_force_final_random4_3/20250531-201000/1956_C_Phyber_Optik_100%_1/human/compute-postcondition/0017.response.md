The only variables in the loop head are variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `sum` is `n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/6`, `stdin` contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0), `i` is `n+1`, `j` is 2**
