Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 4, `sum` is 22 + (4 * 4 - (4 - 1) * (4 - 1)) * 4, `t` is at least 3, `j` is `n+1`, stdin contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0)**

In this output state, the value of `sum` has been updated by adding the result of the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to its initial value of 22. Since `i` is 4, this expression evaluates to `(4 * 4 - (4 - 1) * (4 - 1)) * 4 = (16 - 9) * 4 = 7 * 4 = 28`. Therefore, the new value of `sum` is 22 + 28 = 50. The other variables remain unchanged.
