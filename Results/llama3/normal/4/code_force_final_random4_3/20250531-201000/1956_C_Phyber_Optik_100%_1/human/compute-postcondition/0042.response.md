Output State: **n is at least 2, i is n+1, sum is (n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) / 6 + 1, t is at least 2, j is n, stdin contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0), and this is printed: 2, 1, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `n` is still at least 2, `i` has reached `n+1`, `sum` has been updated to the sum of the squares of the first `n` positive integers plus 1, `t` is still at least 2, `j` is still `n`, the standard input still contains zero or more inputs (each an integer greater than 0), and the output still includes the numbers 2, 1, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
