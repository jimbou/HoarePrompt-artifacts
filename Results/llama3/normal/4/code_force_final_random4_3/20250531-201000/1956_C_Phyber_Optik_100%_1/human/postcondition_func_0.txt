The function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer t represents the number of subsequent integers. For each integer n, it calculates a sum using a formula involving squares and cubes of numbers from 2 to n, then prints the sum and the value 2n. It then prints a series of lines, each containing the numbers 1 and 2, followed by a range of numbers from 1 to n, repeated n times. After processing all integers, the function leaves the input stream empty and the variables t, n, i, and j with values 0, the last input integer, n+1, and n+1, respectively, and the sum variable with the calculated value.
