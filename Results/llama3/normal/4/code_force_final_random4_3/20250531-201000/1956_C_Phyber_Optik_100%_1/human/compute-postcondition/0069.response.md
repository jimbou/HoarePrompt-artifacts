Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n+1`, `sum` is 1 + âˆ‘[(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i] from i=2 to n, `t` is at least 3, `j` is `n+1`, stdin contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0)**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the output state is such that `n` remains unchanged as an integer greater than 0, `i` has reached `n+1` indicating the loop has completed, `sum` has accumulated the results of the calculation `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for all `i` from 2 to `n`, `t` remains at least 3, `j` remains `n+1`, and the state of the input stream (`stdin`) remains unchanged with zero or more inputs being integers greater than 0.
