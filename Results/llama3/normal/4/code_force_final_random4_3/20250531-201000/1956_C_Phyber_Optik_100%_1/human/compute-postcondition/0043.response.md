The code prints the value of `sum` which is `(n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) / 6 + 1` and the value of `n + n` which is `2 * n`.

Since `n` is at least 2, the value of `n + n` will be at least 4.

The value of `sum` is a formula that calculates the sum of the first `n` positive integers plus 1. This formula is a well-known mathematical formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

Output: **(n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) / 6 + 1, 2 * n (where n is at least 2)**
