The code prints the value of `sum` which is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, and the value of `n + n` which is twice the value of `n`.

Since `sum` is calculated as `n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/6`, its value depends on the value of `n`. However, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `sum` without knowing the value of `n`.

Similarly, the value of `n + n` is twice the value of `n`, but we can't compute the exact numerical value without knowing the value of `n`.

Output: **sum (where sum is n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/6), 2n (where n is an integer greater than 0)**
