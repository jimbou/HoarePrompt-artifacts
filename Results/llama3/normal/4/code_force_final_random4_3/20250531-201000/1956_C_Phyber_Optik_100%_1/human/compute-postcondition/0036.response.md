To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 2). Since `n` is already greater than 0, we can refine this to `n` being at least 2.

The variable `i` is initialized to `n+1`, but for the loop to execute, it should be within the range `[2, n+1]`. Therefore, we can adjust `i` to be 2, which is the starting value of the range.

The other variables and states (`sum`, `t`, `stdin`, and the printed output) are not directly related to the loop head and do not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `sum` is 1, `t` is at least 2, `j` is `n`, stdin contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0), and this is printed: 2, 1, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive)**
