Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 4, `sum` is 31, `t` is at least 2, `j` is `n`, stdin contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0), and this is printed: 2, 1, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive)**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sum` by adding the result of the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`. Since `i` is 4, the expression evaluates to `(4 * 4 - (4 - 1) * (4 - 1)) * 4 = (16 - 9) * 4 = 7 * 4 = 28`. Adding this to the initial value of `sum`, which is 19, results in a new value of `sum` equal to 31. The other variables remain unchanged.
