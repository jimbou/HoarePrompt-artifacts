Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer greater than 0, sum is 1, stdin contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0)**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code. The value of `n` is now an integer greater than 0, which was assigned from the input. The variable `sum` has been initialized to 1. The state of stdin has been updated to reflect that one input has been consumed, leaving zero or more inputs remaining.
