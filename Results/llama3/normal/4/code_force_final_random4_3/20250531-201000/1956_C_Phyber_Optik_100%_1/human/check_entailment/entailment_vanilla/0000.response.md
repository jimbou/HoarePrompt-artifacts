Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix that can be achieved by performing two types of operations: assigning a permutation of integers from 1 to n to a row or a column. The goal is to find a solution with no more than 2n operations.

The provided program calculates the maximum sum by iterating over the range from 2 to n (inclusive) and adding the difference between the sum of squares of consecutive integers to the total sum. This is based on the observation that the maximum sum can be achieved by assigning the largest possible values to the elements in the matrix.

The program then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations (which is 2n) and generates the operations by iterating over the range from 1 to n (inclusive). For each iteration, it prints two operations: one for assigning a permutation to a row and another for assigning a permutation to a column. The permutations are generated using the range function, which produces a sequence of numbers from 1 to n.

The program's logic is correct, and it produces the expected output for the given problem. The maximum sum is calculated correctly, and the operations are generated in a way that achieves this maximum sum.

Correctness: **True**
