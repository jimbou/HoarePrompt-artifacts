Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing a series of operations. The program calculates the maximum sum using a formula involving squares and cubes of numbers from 2 to n, and then prints the sum and the number of operations required to achieve this sum.

The program then prints a series of lines, each containing the numbers 1 and 2, followed by a range of numbers from 1 to n, repeated n times. These lines represent the operations required to achieve the maximum sum.

The key to the correctness of the program lies in the formula used to calculate the maximum sum. The formula is derived from the fact that the maximum sum can be achieved by placing the largest possible numbers in the matrix, which can be done by using the numbers from 1 to n in a specific order.

The program correctly implements this formula and prints the correct output for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
