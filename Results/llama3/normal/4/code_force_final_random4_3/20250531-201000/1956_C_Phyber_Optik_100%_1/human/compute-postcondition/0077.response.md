To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables, `i`, `sum`, and `t`, are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n+1`, `sum` is 1 + âˆ‘[(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i] from i=2 to n, `t` is at least 3, `j` is 2**
