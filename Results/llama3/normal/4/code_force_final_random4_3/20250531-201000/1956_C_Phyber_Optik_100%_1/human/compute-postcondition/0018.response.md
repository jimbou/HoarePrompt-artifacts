To determine what will be printed when the given statement executes, let's break down the components of the print statement based on the initial state provided:

1. `1`: This is a literal integer value that will be printed as is.

2. `n - j + 1`: Here, `n` is an integer greater than 1, and `j` is 2. So, this expression simplifies to `n - 2 + 1 = n - 1`. This means the second value printed will be `n - 1`.

3. `*range(1, n + 1)`: This part of the statement uses the `*` operator to unpack the range of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) into separate arguments to the `print` function. Essentially, it will print all integers from 1 to `n`.

Putting it all together, the print statement will output the following:

- The literal integer `1`.
- The value of `n - 1`.
- All integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Since `n` is an integer greater than 1, and the exact value of `n` is not specified, we can't provide a numerical value for `n - 1` or the range of numbers. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output precisely.

Output: **1, n-1, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is an integer greater than 1)**
