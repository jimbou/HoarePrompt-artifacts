The code prints the number 2, the value of `n - j + 1` which is `n - 3 + 1` since `j` is 3, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) generated by the `range(1, n + 1)` function.

Since `n` is an integer greater than 0, the value of `n - 2` will be an integer greater than or equal to -1.

Output: **2, n - 2, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is an integer greater than 0)**
