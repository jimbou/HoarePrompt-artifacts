The `print` statement will print the following values:

- The number 2
- The value of `n - j + 1`, where `n` is an integer greater than 0 and `j` is 1. Since `j` is 1, this expression simplifies to `n`.
- A sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), generated by the `range(1, n + 1)` function.

Since `n` is an integer greater than 0, the sequence of numbers will start from 1 and end at `n`.

Output: **2, n, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is an integer greater than 0)**
