To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, which is already given in the initial state. However, we need to adjust the state of `j` to ensure the loop can start.

According to the loop statement, `j` will iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive). Therefore, we need to set `j` to 1, which is the starting value of the range.

The other states, such as `t`, `sum`, `stdin`, and the printed values, are not relevant to the loop execution and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `sum` is `n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/6`, `stdin` contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0), `i` is `n+1`, `j` is 1**
