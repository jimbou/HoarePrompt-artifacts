Output: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `sum` is `n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/6`, `stdin` contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0), `i` is `n+1`, and this is printed: the sum of the first n natural numbers which is `n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/6` and the value of `n + n` which is `2n`**
