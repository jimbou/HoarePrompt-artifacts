Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `sum` is 19, `t` is at least 2, `j` is `n`, stdin contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0), and this is printed: 2, 1, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive)**

In this output state, the value of `sum` has been updated to 19, which is the result of the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` evaluated with `i` equal to 3. The other variables and the printed output remain unchanged.
