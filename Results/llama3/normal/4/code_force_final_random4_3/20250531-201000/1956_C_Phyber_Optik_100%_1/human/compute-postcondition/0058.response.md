The code prints the number 2, the value of `n - j + 1` which is equal to `n - 2`, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
Since `n` is at least 2, `n - 2` will be at least 0.
The sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) will include all integers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is at least 2.
Output: **2, n - 2, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is at least 2)**
