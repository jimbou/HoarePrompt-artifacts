Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The problem description requires the program to output the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of operations in the solution, followed by the description of each operation. However, the program only outputs the sum and the number of operations, but not the description of each operation.

For example, when the input is 2, the program outputs "7 3" which is correct, but it does not output the description of each operation as required by the problem description. The correct output should be:

7 3
1 1 1 2
1 2 1 2
2 1 1 2

The program is missing the logic to output the description of each operation, which is a critical part of the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
