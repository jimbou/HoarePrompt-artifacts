To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable that takes on the value of the current iteration. However, since `_` is not used anywhere, we can ignore it. The important variable is `t`, which is the number of iterations.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `sum` is `n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/6`, `stdin` contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0), `i` is `n+1`, `j` is `n`, and this is printed: 2, 1, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive).**
