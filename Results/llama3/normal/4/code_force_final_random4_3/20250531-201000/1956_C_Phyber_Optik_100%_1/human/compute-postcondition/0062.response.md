Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, i is n+1, sum is 1, t is at least 3, j is n+1, stdin contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0)**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since stdin contains zero or more inputs, an integer greater than 0, `n` becomes an integer greater than 0. The second line assigns the value 1 to `sum`. The previous value of `sum` was `(n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) / 6 + 1`, but this is overwritten by the new value 1.

The values of `i`, `t`, and `j` are not affected by the code block. `i` remains `n+1`, `t` remains at least 3, and `j` remains `n+1`. Stdin is also not affected, as it still contains zero or more inputs, an integer greater than 0.

The printed output is not affected by the code block, as it only assigns values to variables and does not print anything. The printed output remains 2, 1, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), and the sum which is `(n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) / 6 + 1` and `2n` are printed.
