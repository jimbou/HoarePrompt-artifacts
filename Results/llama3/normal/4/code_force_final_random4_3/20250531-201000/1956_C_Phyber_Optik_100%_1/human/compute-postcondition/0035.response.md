Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, sum is 1, t is at least 2, i is n+1, j is n, stdin contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0), and this is printed: 2, 1, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive).**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` was an integer greater than 0, it remains an integer greater than 0. The second line assigns the value 1 to `sum`. Since `sum` was `n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/6`, it is now 1. No other variables are affected. The value of `t` remains at least 2, `i` remains `n+1`, and `j` remains `n`. Stdin contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0). The printed output remains the same: 2, 1, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive).
