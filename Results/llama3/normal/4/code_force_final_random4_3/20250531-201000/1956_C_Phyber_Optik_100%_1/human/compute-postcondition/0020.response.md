The code prints the number 2, the value of `n - j + 1` (where `n` is an integer greater than 1 and `j` is 2), and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
Since `j` is 2, `n - j + 1` is equivalent to `n - 1`.
The sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is generated by the `range(1, n + 1)` function.
Output: **2, n - 1, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive)**
