According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is at least 2, `i` is `n+1`, `sum` is `(n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) / 6 + 1`, `t` is at least 2, `j` is `n`, `stdin` contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0), and this is printed: 2, 1, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), and the sum which is `(n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) / 6 + 1` and `2n` are printed. So for the loop to be executed `n` must be at least 2 and `j` is 1.
State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n+1`, `sum` is `(n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) / 6 + 1`, `t` is at least 2, `j` is 1, `stdin` contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0), and this is printed: 2, 1, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), and the sum which is `(n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) / 6 + 1` and `2n` are printed**
