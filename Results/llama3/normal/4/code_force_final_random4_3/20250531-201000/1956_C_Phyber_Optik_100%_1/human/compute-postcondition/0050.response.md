To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is at least 2.

To execute the loop again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `j` is 2
* `n` is at least 2 (no change)

The other variables (`sum`, `t`, `stdin`, and the printed output) are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n+1`, `sum` is `(n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) / 6 + 1`, `t` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `stdin` contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0), and this is printed: 2, `n` (which is at least 2), and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive)**
