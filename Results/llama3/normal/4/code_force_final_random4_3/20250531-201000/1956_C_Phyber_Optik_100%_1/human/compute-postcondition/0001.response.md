According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer greater than 0, which ensures that the loop will execute. So, the state of `t` needs to be adjusted to be at least 1. The loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body, so its state does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is at least 1, stdin contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0)**
