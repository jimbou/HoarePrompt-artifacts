The code prints the value of `sum` which is 1 plus the summation of the terms calculated as `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for each `i` from 2 to `n`, and the value of `n + n` which is twice the value of `n`.

Output: **1 + âˆ‘[(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i] from i=2 to n, 2n (where n is an integer greater than 0)**
