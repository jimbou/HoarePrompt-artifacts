Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The code snippet is:
```
sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
```
The initial state is:
`t` is at least 1, `n` is at least 3, `sum` is 7, `stdin` contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0), `i` is 3

Now, let's break down the code snippet:

1. `i * i` calculates the square of `i`, which is 3 * 3 = 9.
2. `(i - 1) * (i - 1)` calculates the square of `i - 1`, which is (3 - 1) * (3 - 1) = 2 * 2 = 4.
3. `i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)` calculates the difference between the two squares, which is 9 - 4 = 5.
4. `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` multiplies the result by `i`, which is 5 * 3 = 15.
5. `sum += ...` adds the result to the initial value of `sum`, which is 7 + 15 = 22.

The values of `t`, `n`, and `stdin` are not affected by the code snippet. Only the value of `sum` is updated.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is at least 3, `sum` is 22, `stdin` contains zero or more inputs: an integer (greater than 0), `i` is 3**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, and `stdin` remain the same, while the value of `sum` is updated to 22 by adding 15 to its initial value. The value of `i` is still 3.
