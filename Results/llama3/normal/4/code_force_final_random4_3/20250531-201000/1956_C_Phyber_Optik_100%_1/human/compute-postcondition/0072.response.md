To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 1.

Additionally, since `j` is the loop variable, we need to adjust its state to be equal to the starting value of the range, which is 1.

The other variables `i`, `sum`, and `t` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n+1`, `sum` is 1 + âˆ‘[(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i] from i=2 to n, `t` is at least 3, `j` is 1**
