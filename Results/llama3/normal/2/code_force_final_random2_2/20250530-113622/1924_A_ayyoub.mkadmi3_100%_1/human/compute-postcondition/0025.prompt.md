You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length m, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26. The string s only contains the first k lowercase English alphabets.
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
        
    #State: s is a string of length m, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, s1 is a string containing all characters in s that are in the set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, s2 is a string containing all characters in s that are in the set of the first k lowercase English alphabets and appear after the set of the first k lowercase English alphabets has been reduced to a single character, and alphabet is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets with all characters in s that are in the set of the first k lowercase English alphabets removed.
    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a tuple containing three values: a boolean value indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n` times `k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r` times `k`, and the string `s2`. The boolean value is determined by the comparison of the length of `s1` with `n` times `k`. The substring of `s1` is obtained by slicing `s1` from the index `r` times `k` to the end. The string `s2` contains all characters in `s` that are in the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and appear after the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets has been reduced to a single character.

Return Postconditions: The program returns a tuple containing three values: a boolean value indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n` times `k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r` times `k`, and the string `s2`. The boolean value is determined by the comparison of the length of `s1` with `n` times `k`. The substring of `s1` is obtained by slicing `s1` from the index `r` times `k` to the end. The string `s2` contains all characters in `s` that are in the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and appear after the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets has been reduced to a single character.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
