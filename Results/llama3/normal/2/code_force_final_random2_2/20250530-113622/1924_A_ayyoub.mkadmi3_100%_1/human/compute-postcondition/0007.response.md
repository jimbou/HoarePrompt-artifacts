Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length m that must have at least 1 character, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `alphabet` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the first character in the string `s`. If the size of `alphabet` is more than 1, `s1` and `s2` are empty strings and `alphabet` is updated to contain more than one lowercase English alphabets from the first k alphabets excluding the first character `i` in the string `s`. If the size of `alphabet` is 1, `s1` is an empty string, `s2` is a string containing the first character of `s`, and `alphabet` remains unchanged.***
