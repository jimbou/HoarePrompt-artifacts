Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

3
2 2 4
abba
2 2 3
abb
3 3 10
aabbccabab

The program will output:

YES
NO
aa
NO
ccc

However, the correct output should be:

YES
NO
aa
NO
ccc

The issue is that the program does not correctly handle the case when the length of the string `s` is less than `n * k`. In this case, the program should return `NO` and print a string of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of `s`. However, the program does not do this correctly.

For example, in the third test case, the program outputs `NO` and `ccc`, but `ccc` is not a valid string of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of `s`. A correct output would be `NO` and `ddd`, where `ddd` is a string of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of `s`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
