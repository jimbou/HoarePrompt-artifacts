Output State: **`s` is a string of length m that must have at least 1 character, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `alphabet` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the first character in the string `s`. If the size of `alphabet` is more than 1, `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s`, and `s2` is an empty string. If the size of `alphabet` is 1, `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s`, and `s2` is a string containing the first character of `s`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` remains unchanged, and the integers `k` and `n` also remain unchanged. The set `alphabet` remains the same. The variable `i` is still the first character of the string `s`. The string `s1` now contains the first character of `s`, and the string `s2` remains empty if the size of `alphabet` is more than 1. If the size of `alphabet` is 1, both `s1` and `s2` contain the first character of `s`.
