The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and string `s`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If the string `s` has at least 1 character the loop executes. Before the loop starts, s is a string of length m does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character and `i` is now the first character in the string `s`.
State: **`s` is a string of length m that must have at least 1 character, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `s1` is an empty string, `s2` is an empty string, `alphabet` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the first character in the string `s`**
