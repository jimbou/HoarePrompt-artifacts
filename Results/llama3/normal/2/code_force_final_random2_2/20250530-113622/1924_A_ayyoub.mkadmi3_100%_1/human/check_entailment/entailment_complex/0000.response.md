Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of a given string s. The program uses a function func_1 to process the string s and returns a tuple containing a boolean value, a substring of s1, and a string s2.

The function func_1 works by iterating over the characters in the string s. If a character is in the set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, it is added to the string s1 and removed from the set alphabet. If the set alphabet is reduced to a single character, the character is added to the string s2. The function then calculates the length of the substring s1 and returns a tuple containing a boolean value indicating whether the length of s1 is greater than or equal to n times k, a substring of s1 starting from the index r times k, and the string s2.

The main program then uses the returned tuple to determine whether all possible strings of length n occur as a subsequence of s. If the boolean value is False, it prints 'No' and constructs a string of length n that does not occur as a subsequence of s by appending the character that is not in s1 to the string s2. If the boolean value is True, it prints 'Yes'.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and the function func_1 correctly processes the string s to determine whether all possible strings of length n occur as a subsequence of s.

Correctness: **True**
