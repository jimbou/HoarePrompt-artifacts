Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string s. 

The function func_1 processes the string s and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the length of the processed string is greater than or equal to n times k, a substring of the processed string, and a string containing characters that appear after the set of the first k lowercase English alphabets has been reduced to a single character.

The main part of the program then checks the returned boolean value. If it is False, it means that not all possible strings of length n occur as a subsequence of s, and the program prints 'No' followed by a string of length n that does not occur as a subsequence of s. If the boolean value is True, it means that all possible strings of length n occur as a subsequence of s, and the program prints 'Yes'.

The program correctly handles the case where the set of the first k lowercase English alphabets has been reduced to a single character, and it correctly constructs the string of length n that does not occur as a subsequence of s.

Correctness: **True**
