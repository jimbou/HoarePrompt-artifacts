Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length m+1 that must have at least 2 characters, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `alphabet` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets. If the second character `i` in the string `s` is in `alphabet`, then `alphabet` is updated to exclude `i` if the length of `alphabet` is not 1, and `s1` is increased by the value of `i`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
