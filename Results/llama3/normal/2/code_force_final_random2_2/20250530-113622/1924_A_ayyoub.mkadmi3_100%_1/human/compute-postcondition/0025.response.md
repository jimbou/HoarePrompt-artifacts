Functionality: **This function takes a string `s`, an integer `k`, and an integer `n` as input, where `s` contains only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It processes the string `s` and returns a tuple containing three values: a boolean indicating whether the length of the processed string is greater than or equal to `n` times `k`, a substring of the processed string, and a string containing characters that appear after the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets has been reduced to a single character. The function effectively filters and partitions the input string based on the given parameters.**
