Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing three values: a boolean value indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n` times `k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r` times `k`, and the string `s2`. The boolean value is determined by the comparison of the length of `s1` with `n` times `k`. The substring of `s1` is obtained by slicing `s1` from the index `r` times `k` to the end. The string `s2` contains all characters in `s` that are in the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and appear after the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets has been reduced to a single character.**
