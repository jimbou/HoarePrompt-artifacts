Output State: **s2 has been extended by the character i, alphabet is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets, s is a string of length m+1 that must have at least 2 characters, i is the next character in s, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26**

The first line of the code extends the string `s2` by appending the character `i` to it. The second line reassigns the set `alphabet` to contain the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The values of `s`, `i`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged.
