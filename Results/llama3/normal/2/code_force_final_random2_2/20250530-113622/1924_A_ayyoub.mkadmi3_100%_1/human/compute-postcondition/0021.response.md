Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length m+1 that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the next character in `s`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26. If `i` is in the set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, then `s1` is extended by the character `i`. If the length of the set of the first k lowercase English alphabets is not 1, then the set is updated to contain the first k-1 lowercase English alphabets excluding `i`. Otherwise, `s2` has been extended by the character `i`, and the set remains containing the first k lowercase English alphabets. If `i` is not in the set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, then no changes are made.***
