Output State: **`s` is a string of length m+1 that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the next character in `s`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `s1` is extended by the character `i`. If the length of `alphabet` is not 1, then `alphabet` is a set containing the first k-1 lowercase English alphabets excluding `i`. Otherwise, `s2` has been extended by the character `i`, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s1` has been extended by the character `i`, which is the next character in the string `s`. The values of `s`, `i`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged. The set `alphabet` remains the same, containing the first k-1 lowercase English alphabets excluding `i`, unless its length is 1, in which case `s2` has been extended by the character `i` and `alphabet` contains the first k lowercase English alphabets.
