Output State: **`s` is a string of length m+1 that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the next character in `s`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `alphabet` is a set containing the first k-1 lowercase English alphabets excluding `i`**.

In this output state, the value of `alphabet` has been updated to exclude the character `i`, which was previously included in the set. The other variables remain unchanged, with `s` still being a string of length m+1 with at least 2 characters, `i` being the next character in `s`, `k` and `n` being integers within their respective ranges.
