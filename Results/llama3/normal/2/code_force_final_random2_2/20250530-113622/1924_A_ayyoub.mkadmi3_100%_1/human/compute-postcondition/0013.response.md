Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length m+1 that must have at least 2 characters, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `alphabet` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets. If the length of `alphabet` is not 1, then `alphabet` is updated to exclude the second character in the string `s`.***
