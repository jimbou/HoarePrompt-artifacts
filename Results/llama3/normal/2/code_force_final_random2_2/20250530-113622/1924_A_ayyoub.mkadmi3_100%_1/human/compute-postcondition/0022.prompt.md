Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a string of length m, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, s1 is an empty string, s2 is an empty string, and alphabet is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i in alphabet:
        if len(alphabet) != 1:
            alphabet.remove(i)
        else:
            s2 += i
            alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
        s1 += i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a string of length m that must have at least 1 character, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `alphabet` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the first character in the string `s`. If `i` is in `alphabet`, then if the size of `alphabet` is more than 1, `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s`, and `s2` is an empty string. If the size of `alphabet` is 1, `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s`, and `s2` is a string containing the first character of `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a string of length m+1 that must have at least 2 characters, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `alphabet` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets. If the second character `i` in the string `s` is in `alphabet`, then `alphabet` is updated to exclude `i` if the length of `alphabet` is not 1, and `s1` is increased by the value of `i`. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a string of length m+1 that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the next character in `s`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26. If `i` is in the set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, then `s1` is extended by the character `i`. If the length of the set of the first k lowercase English alphabets is not 1, then the set is updated to contain the first k-1 lowercase English alphabets excluding `i`. Otherwise, `s2` has been extended by the character `i`, and the set remains containing the first k lowercase English alphabets. If `i` is not in the set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, then no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
