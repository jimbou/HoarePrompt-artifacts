Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length m+1 that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the next character in `s`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26. If the length of `alphabet` is not 1, then `alphabet` is a set containing the first k-1 lowercase English alphabets excluding `i`. Otherwise, `s2` has been extended by the character `i`, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets.***
