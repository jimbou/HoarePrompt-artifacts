Output State: **`s` is a string of length `m`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, `s1` is a string containing all characters in `s` that are in the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `s2` is a string containing all characters in `s` that are in the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and appear after the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets has been reduced to a single character, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets with all characters in `s` that are in the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets removed, and `r` is the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.**

In this output state, the value of `r` is calculated by dividing the length of `s1` by `k` and taking the integer part of the result. The other variables remain unchanged.
