Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 2, `q` is 2, `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 1 character, stdin contains 0 inputs. If the first character `i` of `s` is 'A', then `ac` is the number of 'A's in `s` plus 1 and `bc` is the number of 'B's in `s`. If the first character `i` of `s` is not 'A', then `ac` is the number of 'A's in `s` and `bc` is the number of 'B's in `s` plus 1.***
