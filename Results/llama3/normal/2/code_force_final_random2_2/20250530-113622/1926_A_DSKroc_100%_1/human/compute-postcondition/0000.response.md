The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input integer to `t`. The first input integer is between 1 and 32. The second input is a series of strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, and the number of strings is equal to the first integer. After the code is executed, the first input integer is consumed, and the second input remains in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, stdin contains one input: a series of `t` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.**
