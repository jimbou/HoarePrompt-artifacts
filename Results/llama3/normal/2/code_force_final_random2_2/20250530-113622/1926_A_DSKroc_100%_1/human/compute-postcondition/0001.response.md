The only variables in the loop head are variables  q and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `q` and `t`. If t is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is an integer between 1 and 32, stdin contains one input: a series of `t` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and q is now 0. 
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, stdin contains one input: a series of `t` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `q` is 0,  `t` must be greater than 0**
