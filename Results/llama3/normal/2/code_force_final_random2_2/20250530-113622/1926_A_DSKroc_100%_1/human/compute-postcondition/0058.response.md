Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `q` is 2, `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 2 characters, stdin contains 0 inputs. If the first character `i` of `s` is 'A', then `ac` is the number of 'A's in `s` plus 2 and `bc` is the number of 'B's in `s`. If the first character `i` of `s` is not 'A', then `ac` is the number of 'A's in `s` plus 1 and `bc` is the number of 'B's in `s` plus 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ac` has been incremented by 1. If the first character of `s` is 'A', then `ac` is now the number of 'A's in `s` plus 2. If the first character of `s` is not 'A', then `ac` is now the number of 'A's in `s` plus 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
