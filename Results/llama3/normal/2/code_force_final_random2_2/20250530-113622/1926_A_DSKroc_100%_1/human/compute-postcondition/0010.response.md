Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is 0, `s` is a string of length 4 consisting of letters A and B, `ac` is either 2 or 1, `bc` is either 0 or 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: a series of `t-1` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.**

In this output state, the value of `ac` has been incremented by 1. If the second character of `s` is 'A', then `ac` is now 2 and `bc` is still 0. If the second character of `s` is not 'A', then `ac` is now 1 and `bc` is still 1. The values of `t`, `q`, `s`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
