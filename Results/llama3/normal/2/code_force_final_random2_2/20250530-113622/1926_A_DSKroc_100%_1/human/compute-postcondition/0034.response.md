Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is 1, `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 2 characters, `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs: a series of `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If the first character `i` in `s` is 'A', then `ac` is the number of 'A's in `s` plus 2 and `bc` is the number of 'B's in `s`. If the first character `i` in `s` is not 'A', then `ac` is the number of 'A's in `s` plus 1 and `bc` is the number of 'B's in `s` plus 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is still 1, `s` is still a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B with at least 2 characters, and `stdin` still contains `t-3` inputs. The value of `ac` has been incremented by 1, so if the first character of `s` is 'A', `ac` is now the number of 'A's in `s` plus 2, otherwise it is the number of 'A's in `s` plus 1. The value of `bc` remains the same, which is the number of 'B's in `s` if the first character of `s` is 'A', or the number of 'B's in `s` plus 1 if the first character of `s` is not 'A'.
