Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `q` is 2, `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 3 characters, stdin contains 0 inputs. If the first character `i` of `s` is 'A', then `ac` is the number of 'A's in `s` plus 3 and `bc` is the number of 'B's in `s`. If the first character `i` of `s` is not 'A', then `ac` is the number of 'A's in `s` plus 2 and `bc` is the number of 'B's in `s` plus 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 2, `q` is still 2, and `s` is still a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B with at least 3 characters. The stdin is still empty. The value of `ac` has been incremented by 1. If the first character of `s` is 'A', then `ac` is now the number of 'A's in `s` plus 3, otherwise it is the number of 'A's in `s` plus 2. The value of `bc` remains the same, which is the number of 'B's in `s` if the first character of `s` is 'A', or the number of 'B's in `s` plus 2 if the first character of `s` is not 'A'.
