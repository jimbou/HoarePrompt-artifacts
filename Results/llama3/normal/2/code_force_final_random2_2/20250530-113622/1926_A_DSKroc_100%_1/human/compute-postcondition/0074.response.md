Functionality: **This function reads a series of input strings from the standard input, each consisting of letters A and B, and prints the dominant letter ('A' or 'B') for each string. The number of input strings is determined by the first integer input, which can range from 1 to 32. The function then outputs the dominant letter for each string, either 'A' or 'B', based on the count of 'A's and 'B's in each string.**
