Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is 0, `s` is a string of length 4 consisting of letters A and B, `ac` is either 0 or 1, `bc` is either 1 or 2, stdin contains `t-1` inputs: a series of `t-1` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If the second character of `s` is 'A', then `ac` is 1 and `bc` is 1. If the second character of `s` is not 'A', then `ac` is 0 and `bc` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `bc` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The second character of `s` still determines the values of `ac` and `bc`, but now `bc` is either 1 or 2, depending on whether the second character of `s` is 'A' or not.
