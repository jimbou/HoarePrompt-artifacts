Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is 1, `ac` is the number of 'A's in `s`, `bc` is the number of 'B's in `s` plus 1, `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 1 character, `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs: a series of `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `i` is the first character in `s` and `i` is not 'A'**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is still 1, `ac` is still the number of 'A's in `s`, `bc` is increased by 1, `s` is still a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 1 character, `stdin` still contains `t-3` inputs: a series of `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, and `i` is still the first character in `s` and `i` is not 'A'.
