Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is 1, `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 1 character, `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs: a series of `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If the first character `i` in `s` is 'A', then `ac` is the number of 'A's in `s` plus 1 and `bc` is the number of 'B's in `s`. If the first character `i` in `s` is not 'A', then `ac` is the number of 'A's in `s` and `bc` is the number of 'B's in `s` plus 1.***
