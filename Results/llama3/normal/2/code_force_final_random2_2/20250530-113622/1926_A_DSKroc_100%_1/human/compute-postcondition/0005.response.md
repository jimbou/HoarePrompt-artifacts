Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is 0, `ac` is 1, `bc` is 0, `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: a series of `t-1` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, the first character of `s` is 'A', and `i` is 'A'.**

In this output state, the value of `ac` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The first character of `s` is still 'A', and `i` is still 'A'. The stdin still contains `t-1` inputs, which are a series of `t-1` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.
