Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is 1, `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 2 characters, `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs: a series of `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If the first character `i` in `s` is 'A', then `ac` is the number of 'A's in `s` plus 1 and `bc` is the number of 'B's in `s` plus 1. If the first character `i` in `s` is not 'A', then `ac` is the number of 'A's in `s` and `bc` is the number of 'B's in `s` plus 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 32, `q` remains 1, `s` remains a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B with at least 2 characters, and `stdin` still contains `t-3` inputs. The value of `bc` has been incremented by 1, so if the first character of `s` is 'A', `bc` is now the number of 'B's in `s` plus 1, and if the first character of `s` is not 'A', `bc` is now the number of 'B's in `s` plus 2. The value of `ac` remains the same.
