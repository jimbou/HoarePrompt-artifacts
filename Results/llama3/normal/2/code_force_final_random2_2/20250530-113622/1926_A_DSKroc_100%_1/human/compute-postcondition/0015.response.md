Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is 0, `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: a series of `t-1` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If the second character of `s` is 'A', then if `i` is 'A', `ac` is either 2 or 1, and `bc` is either 1 or 2. If `i` is not 'A', then `ac` is 1 and `bc` is 2. If the second character of `s` is not 'A', then if `i` is 'A', `ac` is either 1 or 0, and `bc` is either 2 or 3. If `i` is not 'A', then `ac` is 0 and `bc` is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `bc` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `ac` and `bc` are updated accordingly, taking into account the incremented value of `bc`.
