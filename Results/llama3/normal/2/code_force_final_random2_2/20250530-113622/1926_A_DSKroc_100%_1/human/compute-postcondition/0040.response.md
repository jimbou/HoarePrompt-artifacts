Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is 1, `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 3 characters, `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs: a series of `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `i` is the third character in `s`. If the first character in `s` is 'A', then `ac` is the number of 'A's in `s` plus 2 and `bc` is the number of 'B's in `s` if `i` is 'A', otherwise `ac` is the number of 'A's in `s` plus 1 and `bc` is the number of 'B's in `s` plus 2. If the first character in `s` is not 'A', then `ac` is the number of 'A's in `s` plus 1 if `i` is 'A', otherwise `ac` is the number of 'A's in `s` and `bc` is the number of 'B's in `s` plus 3. ***
