Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when Alice and Bob are in the same column, but Alice is not directly below Bob. In this case, the program incorrectly assumes that Alice can only move down or down-right, and does not consider the possibility of Alice moving down-left.

For example, consider the input:

10 10 2 5 5 5

In this case, Alice is in the second row and fifth column, and Bob is in the fifth row and fifth column. The program will incorrectly output "Draw", when in fact Alice can win by moving down-left.

The correct output for this input should be "Alice".
