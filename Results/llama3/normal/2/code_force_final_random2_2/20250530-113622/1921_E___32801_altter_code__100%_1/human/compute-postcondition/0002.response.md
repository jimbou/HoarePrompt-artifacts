Based on the initial state, the code will print the string 'draw'.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

* The initial state mentions that stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, but this information is not relevant to the print statement.
* The variables n, m, x1, y1, x2, and y2 are mentioned, but their values are not used in the print statement.
* The print statement simply prints the string 'draw'.

Therefore, the output will be the string 'draw', without any relation to the values of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **draw**
