You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line of stdin contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b (1 <= x_a, x_b <= h <= 10^6, 1 <= y_a, y_b <= w <= 10^9) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a != x_b or y_a != y_b.
    r = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n, m, x1, y1, x2, y2 = r[0], r[1], r[2], r[3], r[4], r[5]
    if (x2 <= x1) :
        print('draw')
        #This is printed: draw
        return
        #The program returns nothing, 'draw' is printed, and the values of n, m, x1, y1, x2, and y2 remain unchanged.
    #State: stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer, m is an integer, x1 is an integer, y1 is an integer, x2 is an integer, y2 is an integer, and x2 is greater than x1
    if ((x2 - x1) % 2 != 0) :
        if (y1 == y2) :
            print('Alice')
            #This is printed: Alice
            return
            #The program returns nothing
        #State: *stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer, m is an integer, x1 is an integer, y1 is an integer, x2 is an integer, y2 is an integer, x2 is greater than x1, the difference between x2 and x1 is an odd number, and y1 is not equal to y2
    else :
        if (y1 == y2) :
            print('bob')
            #This is printed: bob
            return
            #The program returns nothing and 'bob' is printed, the difference between x2 and x1 is even, and the current values of y1 and y2 are equal.
        #State: *stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer, m is an integer, x1 is an integer, y1 is an integer, x2 is an integer, y2 is an integer, x2 is greater than x1, the difference between x2 and x1 is even, and y1 is not equal to y2

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing, 'draw' is printed, and the values of n, m, x1, y1, x2, and y2 remain unchanged.

Case_2: *stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer, m is an integer, x1 is an integer, y1 is an integer, x2 is an integer, y2 is an integer, x2 is greater than x1, the difference between x2 and x1 is an odd number, and y1 is not equal to y2

Case_3: *stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer, m is an integer, x1 is an integer, y1 is an integer, x2 is an integer, y2 is an integer, x2 is greater than x1, the difference between x2 and x1 is even, and y1 is not equal to y2


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
