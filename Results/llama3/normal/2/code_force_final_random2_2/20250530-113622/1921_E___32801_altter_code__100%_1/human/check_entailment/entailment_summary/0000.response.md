Reasoning: 
The program provided seems to be a correct implementation of the game logic described in the problem statement. It correctly handles the different possible moves of Alice and Bob, and it determines the winner based on the positions of the chips on the board. The program also correctly handles the edge cases where the chips are in the same position, or where one player cannot make a move.

However, there are a few issues with the program. The function `func_1` is not necessary and can be removed. The variable names are not very descriptive, which can make the code harder to understand. The program also uses a lot of magic numbers, which can make the code harder to understand and maintain.

Despite these issues, the program seems to be correct and should produce the correct output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
