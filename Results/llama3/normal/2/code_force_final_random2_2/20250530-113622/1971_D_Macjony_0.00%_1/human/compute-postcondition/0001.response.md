To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, we don't need to adjust its value. However, we do need to adjust the state of `i` to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500**
