Output: **`count` is the number of transitions from '0' to '1' in the string `s`, `j` is equal to `len(s) - 1`. If there is at least one transition from '0' to '1' in the string `s`, then `count` is decreased by one and `flag` is True. If there is no transition from '0' to '1' in the string `s`, then `count` and `flag` remain unchanged, and the number of transitions from '0' to '1' in the string `s` is being printed**
