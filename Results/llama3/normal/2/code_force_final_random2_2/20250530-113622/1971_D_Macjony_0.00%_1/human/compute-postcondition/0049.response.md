Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 4 if j is 3, or s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 5 if j is 4. If s[j] is not equal to s[j + 1], then count is 4 if s[j] is '0' and s[j + 1] is '1', otherwise count is 3. If s[j] is equal to s[j + 1], then count is 2. If s[j] is not equal to '0' or s[j + 1] is not equal to '1', then j is 3, otherwise j is 4. If s[j] is '0' and s[j + 1] is '1', then flag is True and j is j + 1. Otherwise, flag remains unchanged.***
