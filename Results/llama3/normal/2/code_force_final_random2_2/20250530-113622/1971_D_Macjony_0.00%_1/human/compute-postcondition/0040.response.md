Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 3, `count` is 3 if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`, otherwise `count` is 2, `j` is 2, `flag` is True if `s[j-1]` is '0' and `s[j]` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`, then `count` is now 3, otherwise it is 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
