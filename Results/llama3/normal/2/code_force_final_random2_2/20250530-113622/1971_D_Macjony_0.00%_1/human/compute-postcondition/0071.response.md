Postcondition: ***`s` is a string from stdin with a length of at least 2, `t` is greater than 1, `j` is less than len(s), `s[j]` is '1' or '0', and `s[j - 1]` is '1' or '0'. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`, then `count` is 3. If `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', then `flag` is True. Otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is equal to `s[j + 1]`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
