Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 2, `j` is less than `len(s) - 1`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`, then `count` is increased by 1. If `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', then `flag` is True. Otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged.***
