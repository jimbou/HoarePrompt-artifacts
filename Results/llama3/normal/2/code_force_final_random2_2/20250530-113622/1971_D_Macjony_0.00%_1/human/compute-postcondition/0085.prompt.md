Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains t strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    s = input()
    count = 1
    flag = False
    j = 0
    while j < len(s) - 1:
        if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
            count += 1
            if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                flag = True
                j += 1
        j += 1
    if flag:
        count -= 1
    print(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `count` is the number of transitions from '0' to '1' or '1' to '0' in `s` plus 1, `j` is equal to `len(s) - 1`. If there is at least one transition from '0' to '1' in `s`, then `flag` is True, and the number of transitions from '0' to '1' or '1' to '0' in `s` plus 1 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `count` is the number of transitions from '0' to '1' in the string `s`, `j` is equal to `len(s) - 1`. If there is at least one transition from '0' to '1' in the string `s`, then `count` is decreased by one and `flag` is True. If there is no transition from '0' to '1' in the string `s`, then `count` and `flag` remain unchanged, and the number of transitions from '0' to '1' in the string `s` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a string from stdin, `t` is greater than 1, `j` is equal to `len(s) - 1`. If `s` contains the substring '01', then `count` is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, `count` is greater than or equal to 1, and the value of `count` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
