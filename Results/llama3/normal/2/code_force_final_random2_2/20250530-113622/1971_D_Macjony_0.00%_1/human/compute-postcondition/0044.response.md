Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-3` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 3. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`, then `count` is 3, otherwise `count` is 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to '0' or `s[j + 1]` is not equal to '1', then `j` is 3, otherwise `j` is 4. `flag` is True if `s[j-1]` is '0' and `s[j]` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, so its new value depends on the previous value of `j`. If `s[j]` is not equal to '0' or `s[j + 1]` is not equal to '1', then `j` is now 3, otherwise `j` is now 4. The other variables remain unchanged.
