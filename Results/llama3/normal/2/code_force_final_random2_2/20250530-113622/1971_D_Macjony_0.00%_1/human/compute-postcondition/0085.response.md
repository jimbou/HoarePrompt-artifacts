Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 500 inclusive, `i` is equal to `t`, stdin is empty, `s` is the last string read from stdin, `count` is the number of transitions from '0' to '1' or '1' to '0' in `s` plus 1, `j` is equal to `len(s) - 1`. If there is at least one transition from '0' to '1' in `s`, then `flag` is True and `count` is decreased by one. Otherwise, `flag` is False.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be between 0 and 500 inclusive, `i` will be equal to `t`, the standard input will be empty, `s` will be the last string read from the standard input, `count` will be the number of transitions from '0' to '1' or '1' to '0' in `s` plus 1, and `j` will be equal to the length of `s` minus 1. If there is at least one transition from '0' to '1' in `s`, then `flag` will be True and `count` will be decreased by one. Otherwise, `flag` will be False.
