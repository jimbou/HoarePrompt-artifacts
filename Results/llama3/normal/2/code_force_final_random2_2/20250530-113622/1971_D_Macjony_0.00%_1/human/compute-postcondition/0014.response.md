Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 0, `count` is increased by 1, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 1. If `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', then `j` is increased by 1 and `flag` is set to True. Otherwise, no changes are made to `j` and `flag`***
