Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, count is 1, flag is False, j is 0
Code of the loop:
while j < len(s) - 1:
    if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
        count += 1
        if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
            flag = True
            j += 1
    j += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 1. If s[j] is not equal to s[j + 1], then count is 2. If s[j] is '0' and s[j + 1] is '1', then flag is True, j is 2, the current value of s[j] is not defined and the current value of s[j + 1] is not defined. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 1, `j` is increased by 1, if `s[j-1]` is not equal to `s[j]`, then `count` is increased by 1, if `s[j-1]` is '0' and `s[j]` is '1', then `flag` is set to True.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 2, `j` is less than `len(s)`, If `s[j-1]` is not equal to `s[j]`, then `count` is increased by 1. If `s[j-1]` is '0' and `s[j]` is '1', then `flag` is True. Otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
