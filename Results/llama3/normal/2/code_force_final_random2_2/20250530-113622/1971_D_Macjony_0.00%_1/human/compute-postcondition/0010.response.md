Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 1. If s[j] is not equal to s[j + 1], then count is 2. If s[j] is '0' and s[j + 1] is '1', then flag is True, j is 2, the current value of s[j] is not defined and the current value of s[j + 1] is not defined. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of j has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The current value of s[j] and s[j + 1] are not defined because j has moved one step forward. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
