Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `count` is the number of transitions from '0' to '1' or '1' to '0' in `s`, `flag` is True, indicating there is at least one transition from '0' to '1' in `s`, `j` is equal to `len(s) - 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been decreased by 1, but its new value is still equal to the number of transitions from '0' to '1' or '1' to '0' in `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
