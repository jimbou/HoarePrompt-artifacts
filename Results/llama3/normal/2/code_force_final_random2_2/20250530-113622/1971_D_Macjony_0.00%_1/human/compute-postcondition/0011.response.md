According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j and s. If j is less than len(s) - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 2 and s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time j must be less than len(s) - 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 1 and j is less than len(s) - 1**
