Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 2, `j` is less than `len(s) - 2`, `count` is increased by 1**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500. The string `s` still has a length greater than 2, and `j` is still less than `len(s) - 2`.
