Output State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 26, k is a positive integer between 1 and 26, s is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'**.

The first line assigns the two positive integers from stdin to `n` and `k`, respectively. Since stdin contains two inputs, it becomes empty after this line. The second line assigns the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw' to `s`. No other variables are affected.
