Reasoning:

The problem requires finding a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. The program provided attempts to solve this problem.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k` and calls the function `func_1`.
3. The function `func_1` generates a string `s` by repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times.

The key insight here is that by repeating the first `k` alphabets `n` times, the program ensures that every possible string of length `n` that can be formed using these `k` alphabets will occur as a subsequence of `s`. This is because each alphabet will appear `n` times in `s`, allowing for all possible combinations of these alphabets to be formed.

For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the program will generate the string `abab`. This string contains all possible subsequences of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets: `aa`, `ab`, `ba`, and `bb`.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem.

Correctness: **True**
