Output State: **`sChar` has at least three characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string and contains at least one character that is not '1', in addition to the '0' at the end, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `right` is equal to `len(s)`, and `left` is less than or equal to `right`**

The code increments the value of `left` by 1. Since `left` was initially less than `right`, after the increment, `left` is either equal to `right` or still less than `right`. The other variables remain unchanged.
