The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `sChar`. If `sChar` has at least one more character, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sChar` is a non-empty string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s with a length between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing the first character of `sChar`, `i` is the first character in `sChar`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string `sChar` must have at least one more character and `i` is the second character in `sChar`.
State: **`sChar` is a non-empty string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s with a length between 3 and 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing the first character of `sChar`, `i` is the second character in `sChar`**
