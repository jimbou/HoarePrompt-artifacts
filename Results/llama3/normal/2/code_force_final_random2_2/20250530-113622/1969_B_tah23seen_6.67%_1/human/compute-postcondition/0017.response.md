According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `right` and `s`. If `right` is less than the length of `s` and `s[right]` is not '0', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `right` is less than the length of `s` and is incremented by 1, and `s[right]` is not '0'. `right` being less than the length of `s` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `right` is less than the length of `s` minus 1. `s[right]` being not '0' does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `s[right + 1]` is not '0'. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`sChar` has at least three characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string and has at least one more character after the current `right` index, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `right` is less than the length of `s` minus 1, and `s[right + 1]` is not '0'**
