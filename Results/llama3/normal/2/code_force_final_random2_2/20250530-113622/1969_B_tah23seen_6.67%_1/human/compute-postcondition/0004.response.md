Output State: **`sChar` is a non-empty string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s with a length between 3 and 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing the first two characters of `sChar`, `i` is the second character in `sChar`**

In this output state, the value of `sChar` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the code. The list `s` now contains the first two characters of `sChar`, as the second character `i` has been appended to it. The value of `i` remains the same, as it is not modified by the code.
