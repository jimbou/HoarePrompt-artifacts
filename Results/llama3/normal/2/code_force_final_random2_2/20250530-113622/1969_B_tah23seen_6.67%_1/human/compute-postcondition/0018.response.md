Output State: **`sChar` has at least three characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string and has at least one more character after the current `right` index, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `right` is less than the length of `s` minus 1 and is increased by 1, and `s[right + 1]` is not '0'**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been increased by 1, but it is still less than the length of `s` minus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
