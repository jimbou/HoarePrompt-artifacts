Output State: **`sChar` has at least three characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `right` is increased by 2 and `right` must be less than `len(s)`, and `s[right-1]` must not be '0'**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been increased by 1, so it is now 2 more than its original value. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `right` must be less than `len(s)` and `s[right-1]` must not be '0' is still valid.
