Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`sChar` has at least three characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string and contains at least one character that is not '1', in addition to the '0' at the end, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `right` is greater than `len(s)`, and `left` is less than `len(s)`, and `len(s)` is greater than its current value. If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', then `s[right]` and `s[left]` have been swapped, and cost has been incremented by `right - left + 1`.
Code of the loop:
while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
    right += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sChar` has at least three characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string and contains at least one character that is not '1', in addition to the '0' at the end, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `right` is less than `len(s)` and `s[right]` must not be '0', and `right` is increased by 1, and `left` is less than `len(s)`, and `len(s)` is greater than its current value.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `sChar` has at least three characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string and contains at least two characters that are not '1', in addition to the '0' at the end, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `right` is less than or equal to `len(s) - 1` and `s[right]` must not be '0', and `s[right + 1]` must not be '0', and `left` is less than `len(s)`, and `len(s)` is greater than its current value.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `sChar` has at least three characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string and contains at least two characters that are not '1', in addition to the '0' at the end, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `right` is less than or equal to `len(s) - 1`, `s[right]` is not '0', `s[right + 1]` is not '0' if `right` is less than `len(s) - 2`, `left` is less than `len(s)`, and `len(s)` is greater than its current value


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
