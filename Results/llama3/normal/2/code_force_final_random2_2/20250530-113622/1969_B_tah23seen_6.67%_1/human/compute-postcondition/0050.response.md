Output State: **`sChar` has at least three characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string and contains at least two characters that are not '1', in addition to the '0' at the end, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `right` is less than or equal to `len(s) - 1` and `s[right]` must not be '0', and `s[right + 1]` must not be '0', and `left` is less than `len(s)`, and `len(s)` is greater than its current value.**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been incremented by 1, but it is still less than or equal to `len(s) - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `s[right]` and `s[right + 1]` are still valid, as `right` has only been incremented by 1. The length of `s` is still greater than its current value, and `left` is still less than `len(s)`. The original string `sChar` and the list `s` containing its characters remain unchanged.
