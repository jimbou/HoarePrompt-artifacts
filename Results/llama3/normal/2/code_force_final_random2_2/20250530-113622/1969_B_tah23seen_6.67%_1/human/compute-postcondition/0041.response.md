According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `left` and `s`. If `left` is less than `len(s)` and `s[left]` is not '1', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is less than or equal to `len(s)` and points to a character in `s` that is either '1' or not '1'. For the loop to execute one more time, `left` must be less than `len(s)`, and `s[left]` must not be '1'. Also, since `left` is less than or equal to `len(s)`, it must be less than `len(s)` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`sChar` has at least three characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string and contains at least one character that is not '1', in addition to the '0' at the end, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `right` is equal to `len(s)`, and `left` is less than `len(s)` and points to a character in `s` that is not '1'**
