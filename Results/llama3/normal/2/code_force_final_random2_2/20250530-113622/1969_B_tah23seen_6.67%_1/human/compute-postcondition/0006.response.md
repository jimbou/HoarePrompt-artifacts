Output State: **`sChar` is a non-empty string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s with a length between 3 and 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing the first three characters of `sChar`, `i` is the third character in `sChar`.**

In this output state, the value of `sChar` remains unchanged, still being a non-empty string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s with a length between 3 and 2 * 10^5. The value of `i` also remains unchanged, still being the third character in `sChar`. However, the value of `s` has been updated to include the third character of `sChar`, which is `i`. Therefore, `s` now contains the first three characters of `sChar`.
