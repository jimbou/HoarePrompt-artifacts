Output State: **`sChar` has at least three characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string and contains at least two characters that are not '1', in addition to the '0' at the end, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `right` is less than or equal to `len(s) - 1`, `s[right]` is not '0', `s[right + 1]` is not '0' if `right` is less than `len(s) - 2`, `left` is less than `len(s)`, and `len(s)` is greater than its current value**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been incremented by 1, but its relationship with `len(s) - 1` has been updated to "less than or equal to" because `right` could now be equal to `len(s) - 1`. The condition `s[right + 1]` is not '0' is only valid if `right` is less than `len(s) - 2`, because if `right` is equal to `len(s) - 2`, `right + 1` would be out of range. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
