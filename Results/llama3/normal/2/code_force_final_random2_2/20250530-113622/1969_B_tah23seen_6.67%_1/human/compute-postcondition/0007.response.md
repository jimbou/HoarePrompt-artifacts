Output State: **`sChar` is an empty string, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the string `sChar` will be empty because all its characters have been processed and appended to the list `s`. The list `s` will contain all the characters from the original `sChar` string, in the same order. The variable `i` will hold the last character that was processed from `sChar`, which is the last character of the original string.
