To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition: `right < len(s) and s[right] != '0'`.

1. `right < len(s)`: This condition requires that `right` is less than the length of the list `s`. Since `s` contains all characters of the original `sChar` string and `sChar` has at least two characters, `len(s)` is at least 2. Therefore, to ensure this condition is met, `right` must be less than 2, which is already satisfied since `right` is 1.

2. `s[right] != '0'`: This condition requires that the character at index `right` in the list `s` is not '0'. Given that `right` is 1 and `s[right]` is '1', this condition is already satisfied.

Considering these conditions, no adjustments are needed to the states of `right` or `s[right]` for the loop to execute the first time. The initial conditions provided already satisfy the loop's requirements.

State: **`sChar` has at least two characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string. If the first and second characters of `sChar` are '1' and '0' respectively, then `left` is 0, `cost` is 2, `right` is 1, `s[right]` is '1', and `s[left]` is '0'. Otherwise, `left`, `cost`, and `right` remain unchanged.**
