Output State: **`sChar` has at least three characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `right` is increased by 1, and `s[right - 1]` must not be '0'**.

In this output state, the value of `right` has been incremented by 1, but the other variables remain unchanged. The condition `s[right] must not be '0'` is no longer valid because `right` has been incremented, so we update it to `s[right - 1] must not be '0'` to reflect the new value of `right`.
