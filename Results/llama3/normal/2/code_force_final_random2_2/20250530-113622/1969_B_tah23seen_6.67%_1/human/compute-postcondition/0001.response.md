To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `sChar`. Since `sChar` is already defined as a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s with a length between 2 and 2 * 10^5, we don't need to modify its state. However, we need to ensure that `sChar` is not empty, as the loop will not execute if it is.

The loop will iterate over each character in `sChar`, so we can adjust the state of `i` to be the first character in `sChar`.

State: **`sChar` is a non-empty string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s with a length between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `s` is an empty list, `i` is the first character in `sChar`**
