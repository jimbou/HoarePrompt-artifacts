Output State: **`sChar` has at least three characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string and contains at least two characters that are not '1', in addition to the '0' at the end, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `right` is equal to `len(s)`, `left` is less than `len(s)`, and `len(s)` is greater than its current value.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the `right` pointer has reached the end of the list `s`, while the `left` pointer remains less than the length of `s`. The list `s` still contains at least two characters that are not '1', in addition to the '0' at the end, and `i` remains the last character in the original `sChar` string. The length of `s` is still greater than its current value.
