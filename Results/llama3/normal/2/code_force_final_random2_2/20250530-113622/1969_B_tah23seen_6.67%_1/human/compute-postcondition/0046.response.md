Postcondition: ***`sChar` has at least three characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string and contains at least one character that is not '1', in addition to the '0' at the end, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `right` is greater than `len(s)`, and `left` is less than `len(s)`, and `len(s)` is greater than its current value. If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', then `s[right]` and `s[left]` have been swapped, and cost has been incremented by `right - left + 1`.***
