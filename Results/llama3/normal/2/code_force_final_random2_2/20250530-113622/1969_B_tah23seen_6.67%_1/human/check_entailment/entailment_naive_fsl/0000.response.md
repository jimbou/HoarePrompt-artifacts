Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input string is "101", the program will output 2, but the correct answer is 1. The program is not correctly implementing the cyclic shift operation.

In the program, the while loop is not correctly implemented. The loop should continue until the entire string is sorted, but in the program, it stops as soon as it finds a '0' and a '1' that are not in the correct order. This is not enough to ensure that the entire string is sorted.

Additionally, the program is not correctly calculating the cost of the cyclic shift operation. The cost should be the length of the substring that is being shifted, but in the program, it is being calculated as the difference between the indices of the '0' and '1' that are being swapped.

Therefore, the program is not correct and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
