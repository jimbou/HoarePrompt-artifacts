Output State: **`sChar` has at least three characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string and has at least one more character after the current `right` index, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `right` is less than the length of `s` and is incremented by 1, and `s[right]` is not '0'**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `sChar` still has at least three characters. The list `s` still contains all characters of the original `sChar` string and has at least one more character after the current `right` index. The variable `i` still holds the last character in the original `sChar` string. The variable `right` is incremented by 1, so it is now one position to the right, but still less than the length of `s`. The character at the new `right` index in `s` is not '0'.
