Postcondition: ***sChar has at least three characters, s is a list containing all characters of the original sChar string, i is the last character in the original sChar string. If the first and second characters of sChar are '1' and '0' respectively, and s[right] is '0' and s[left] is '1', then left is the index of the first '1' in s starting from the second character, cost is the original cost plus the difference between right and left plus one, and right is the index of the first '0' in s starting from the second character, and s[right] is '1' and s[left] is '0'. Otherwise, left, cost, and right remain unchanged, and s[left] is '1'.***
