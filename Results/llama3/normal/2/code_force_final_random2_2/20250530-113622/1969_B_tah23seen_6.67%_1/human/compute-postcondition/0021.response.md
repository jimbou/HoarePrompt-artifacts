Output State: **`sChar` has at least two characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string. If the first and second characters of `sChar` are '1' and '0' respectively, then `left` is 1, `cost` is 2, and `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from the second character, and `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '0'. Otherwise, `left`, `cost`, and `right` remain unchanged, and `s[left]` must not be '1'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. If the first and second characters of `sChar` are '1' and '0' respectively, then `left` is now 1, and the values of `cost` and `right` are still 2 and the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from the second character, respectively. Otherwise, the values of `left`, `cost`, and `right` are unchanged.
