Output State: **sChar is an empty string, s is a list containing all characters of the original sChar string, i is the last character in the original sChar string, left is 0, cost is 0, right is 1**

The code block introduces three new variables: `left`, `cost`, and `right`, and assigns them the values 0, 0, and 1, respectively. The initial state of `sChar`, `s`, and `i` remains unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The final state includes the original variables and their values, as well as the new variables and their assigned values.
