Output State: **`sChar` has at least two characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `left` is less than or equal to the length of `s` and greater than its previous value, `s[left-1]` is not '1'**

In this output state, the value of `left` has been incremented by 1, so it is now greater than its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition `s[left] is not '1'` is no longer guaranteed to be true, but `s[left-1] is not '1'` is still true.
