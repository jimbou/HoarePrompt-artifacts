The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is not the last character in `sChar`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second character in `sChar`. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` must be the third character in `sChar`. 
State: **`sChar` is a non-empty string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s with a length between 3 and 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing the first two characters of `sChar`, `i` is the third character in `sChar`**
