Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The program uses a function `func_1` that takes a binary string as input, swaps adjacent elements to move all 0s to the right and all 1s to the left, and returns the total number of swaps performed.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. The function `func_1` modifies the input string in-place, which is not necessary and can be avoided.
2. The function uses a while loop to iterate over the string, which can be replaced with a more efficient for loop.
3. The function uses a variable `cost` to keep track of the total number of swaps, but it does not take into account the fact that a cyclic shift can be performed on a substring of length 1, which has a cost of 1.

Despite these issues, the program produces the correct output for the given test cases. However, it is not the most efficient or elegant solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
