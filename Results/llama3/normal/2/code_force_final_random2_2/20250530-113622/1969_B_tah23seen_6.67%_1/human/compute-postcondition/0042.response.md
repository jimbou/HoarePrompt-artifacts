Output State: **`sChar` has at least three characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string and contains at least one character that is not '1', in addition to the '0' at the end, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `right` is equal to `len(s)`, and `left` is less than `len(s)` and points to a character in `s` that is not '1' and is one position to the right of its previous position.**

In this output state, the value of `left` has been incremented by 1, so it now points to the next character in the list `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
