The code snippet swaps the values of `s[right]` and `s[left]`, and then increments the `cost` by the difference between `right` and `left` plus 1.

Output State: **sChar has at least two characters, s is a list containing all characters of the original sChar string, i is the last character in the original sChar string, left is 0, cost is 2, right is 1, s[right] is '1', and s[left] is '0'.**
