Output State: **`sChar` has at least two characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string. If the first and second characters of `sChar` are '1' and '0' respectively, then `left` is 0, `cost` is 2, and `right` is 2, and `s[right]` is the third character of `sChar` and `s[left]` is '0'. Otherwise, `left`, `cost`, and `right` remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been incremented by 1. If the first and second characters of `sChar` are '1' and '0' respectively, then `right` is now 2, pointing to the third character of `sChar`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
