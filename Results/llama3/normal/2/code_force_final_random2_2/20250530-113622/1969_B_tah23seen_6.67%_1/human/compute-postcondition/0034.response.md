According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `right` and `s`. If `right` is less than `len(s)` and `s[right]` is not '0', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `right` is increased by 2 and `right` must be less than `len(s)`, and `s[right-1]` must not be '0'. `right` being less than `len(s)` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `right` must be less than `len(s)-1`. Also, `s[right-1]` must not be '0' does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `s[right]` must not be '0'. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`sChar` has at least three characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `right` must be less than `len(s)-1` and `s[right]` must not be '0'**
