Output State: **`sChar` has at least three characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string and contains at least one character that is not '1', in addition to the '0' at the end, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `right` is less than `len(s)` and `s[right]` must not be '0', and `right` is increased by 1, and `left` is less than `len(s)`, and `len(s)` is greater than its current value.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `sChar` still has at least three characters. The list `s` still contains all characters of the original `sChar` string and has at least one character that is not '1', in addition to the '0' at the end. The variable `i` still holds the last character in the original `sChar` string. The variable `right` is increased by 1 and is still less than the length of `s`, and the character at the `right` index in `s` is not '0'. The variable `left` is still less than the length of `s`. The length of `s` is still greater than its current value.
