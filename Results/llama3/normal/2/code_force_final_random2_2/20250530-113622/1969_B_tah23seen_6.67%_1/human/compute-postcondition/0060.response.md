Output State: `sChar` has at least three characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string and contains at least two characters that are not '1', in addition to the '0' at the end, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `right` is equal to `len(s)`, `left` is equal to `len(s)`, `len(s)` is greater than its current value, and `s[left]` is '1'.

The loop will continue to execute as long as `left` is less than `len(s)` and `s[left]` is not equal to '1'. After the loop finishes executing, `left` will be equal to `len(s)`, and `s[left]` will be '1'. The other variables will remain unchanged.
