According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `left` and `s`. If `left` is less than `len(s)` and `s[left]` is not '1', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is less than or equal to the length of `s` and greater than its previous value, and `s[left-1]` is not '1'. However, `s[left-1]` is not the same as `s[left]`, so we need to adjust `s[left]` to be not '1'. Also, since `left` is less than or equal to the length of `s`, we need to adjust `left` to be less than the length of `s` to ensure the loop can execute again.

State: **`sChar` has at least two characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `left` is less than the length of `s` and greater than its previous value, `s[left]` is not '1'**
