Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts. The program uses a function `func_1` that takes a binary string `s` as input and returns the minimum total cost.

The function works by iterating through the string and swapping adjacent elements to move all 0s to the right and all 1s to the left. The cost of each swap is calculated as the length of the substring being swapped. The function returns the total number of swaps performed, which is the minimum total cost to make the string sorted.

The program uses a while loop to iterate through the string, and two pointers `left` and `right` to keep track of the current position in the string. The `left` pointer is used to find the next '1' in the string, and the `right` pointer is used to find the next '0' in the string. When a '1' is found on the left and a '0' is found on the right, the function swaps them and increments the cost.

The function modifies the input string in-place and returns the total number of swaps performed.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program appears to be correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts.

Correctness: **True**
