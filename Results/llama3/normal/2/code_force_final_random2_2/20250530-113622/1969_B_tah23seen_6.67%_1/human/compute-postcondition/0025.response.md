Output State: **`sChar` has at least two characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `left` is less than the length of `s`, greater than its previous value, and greater than its previous value by 1, `s[left-1]` is not '1'**

In this output state, the value of `left` has been incremented by 1, and it is still less than the length of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `s[left]` is not guaranteed to be not '1' anymore, but `s[left-1]` is still not '1' because `left` has been incremented.
