Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `sChar` has at least two characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string. If the first and second characters of `sChar` are '1' and '0' respectively, then `left` is 0, `cost` is 2, and `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from the second character, and `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '0'. Otherwise, `left`, `cost`, and `right` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
    left += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sChar` has at least two characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string. If the first and second characters of `sChar` are '1' and '0' respectively, then `left` is 1, `cost` is 2, and `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from the second character, and `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '0'. Otherwise, `left`, `cost`, and `right` remain unchanged, and `s[left]` must not be '1'.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `sChar` has at least two characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `left` is less than or equal to the length of `s` and greater than its previous value, `s[left-1]` is not '1'
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `sChar` has at least two characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `left` is less than the length of `s`, greater than its previous value, and greater than its previous value by 1, `s[left-1]` is not '1'


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
