To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head and adjust the states of the relevant variables accordingly.

The loop head is: `while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):`

1. `left <= right`: Since `left` is 0 and `right` is 1, this condition is already satisfied.
2. `right < len(s)`: This implies that the length of `s` must be greater than 1, because `right` is 1. Since `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string and `sChar` is an empty string, we need to adjust the state of `sChar` to ensure that it has at least two characters.
3. `left < len(s)`: This condition is already satisfied because `left` is 0 and `len(s)` is at least 1 (since `s` contains all characters of the original `sChar` string).

Considering these conditions, we need to adjust the state of `sChar` to ensure that it has at least two characters. The other variables' states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`sChar` must have at least two characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `left` is 0, `cost` is 0, `right` is 1**
