Output State: **`sChar` has at least two characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string. If the first and second characters of `sChar` are '1' and '0' respectively, then `left` is 0, `cost` is 2, and `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from the second character, and `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '0'. Otherwise, `left`, `cost`, and `right` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `right` variable will point to the index of the first '0' in the string `s` starting from the second character, or it will remain unchanged if the first and second characters of `sChar` are not '1' and '0' respectively. The other variables `sChar`, `s`, `i`, `left`, and `cost` will retain their initial values.
