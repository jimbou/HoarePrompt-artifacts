Output State: **sChar has at least three characters, s is a list containing all characters of the original sChar string and contains at least one character that is not '1', in addition to the '0' at the end, i is the last character in the original sChar string, right is greater than len(s), left is less than len(s), len(s) is greater than its current value, s[right] and s[left] have been swapped, and cost has been incremented by right - left + 1.**

The code snippet swaps the values of `s[right]` and `s[left]`, effectively exchanging the characters at the `right` and `left` indices in the list `s`. This operation does not change the length of `s` or the values of `sChar`, `i`, `right`, or `left`. However, it does modify the contents of `s` by swapping two of its elements.

The second line increments the value of `cost` by `right - left + 1`. This operation only affects the value of `cost`, which is increased by the difference between `right` and `left`, plus one. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the final output state includes the swapped values of `s[right]` and `s[left]`, the incremented value of `cost`, and the unchanged values of all other variables.
