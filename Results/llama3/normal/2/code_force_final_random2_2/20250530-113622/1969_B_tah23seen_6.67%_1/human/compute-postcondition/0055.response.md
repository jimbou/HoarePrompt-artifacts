Output State: **`sChar` has at least three characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string and contains at least two characters that are not '1', in addition to the '0' at the end, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `right` is equal to `len(s)`, `left` is less than or equal to `len(s)`, `len(s)` is greater than its current value, and `s[left]` may or may not be '1'**

In this output state, the value of `left` has been incremented by 1, so it is now less than or equal to `len(s)`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `s[left]` may or may not be '1' because the value of `s[left]` is not specified after the increment of `left`.
