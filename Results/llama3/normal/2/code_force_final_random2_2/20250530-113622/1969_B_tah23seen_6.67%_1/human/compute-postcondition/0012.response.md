Postcondition: ***`sChar` has at least two characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string. If the first and second characters of `sChar` are '1' and '0' respectively, then `left` is 0, `cost` is 2, `right` is 1, `s[right]` is '1', and `s[left]` is '0'. Otherwise, `left`, `cost`, and `right` remain unchanged.***
