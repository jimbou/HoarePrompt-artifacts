Output State: **`sChar` is an empty string, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `left` is equal to `len(s)`, `cost` is the total number of swaps performed, and `right` is equal to `len(s)`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the string `sChar` remains empty, the list `s` still contains all characters of the original string, and the variable `i` remains the last character of the original string. The variables `left` and `right` both reach the end of the list `s`, indicating that the loop has processed all characters in the string. The `cost` variable accumulates the total number of swaps performed during the loop's execution.
