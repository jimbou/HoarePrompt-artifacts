Output State: **`sChar` has at least three characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string and contains at least one character that is not '1', in addition to the '0' at the end, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `right` is equal to `len(s)`, and `left` is less than or equal to `len(s)` and points to a character in `s` that is either '1' or not '1'**.

In natural language, the output state is: The string `sChar` still has at least three characters. The list `s` still contains all characters of the original `sChar` string and has at least one character that is not '1', in addition to the '0' at the end. The variable `i` still holds the last character in the original `sChar` string. The variable `right` still equals the length of the list `s`. The variable `left` has been incremented by 1 and now points to the next character in the list `s`, which can be either '1' or not '1', and is less than or equal to the length of `s`.
