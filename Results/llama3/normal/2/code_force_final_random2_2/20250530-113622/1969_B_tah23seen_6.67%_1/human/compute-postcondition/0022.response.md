According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `left` and `s`. If `left` is less than the length of `s` and `s[left]` is not '1', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is the index of the last character in the original `sChar` string, and `s[left]` is '0' if the first and second characters of `sChar` are '1' and '0' respectively, otherwise `s[left]` is not '1'. To ensure the loop can execute again, `left` must be less than the length of `s`, and `s[left]` must not be '1'. Since `left` is the index of the last character in the original `sChar` string, it must be less than the length of `s` if `sChar` has at least two characters. Therefore, only `s[left]` needs to be adjusted to not be '1'.

State: **`sChar` has at least two characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `left` is less than the length of `s`, `s[left]` is not '1'**
