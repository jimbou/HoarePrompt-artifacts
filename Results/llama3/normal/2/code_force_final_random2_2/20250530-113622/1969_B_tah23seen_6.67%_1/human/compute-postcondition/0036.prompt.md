Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *sChar has at least three characters, s is a list containing all characters of the original sChar string, i is the last character in the original sChar string. If the first and second characters of sChar are '1' and '0' respectively, and s[right] is '0' and s[left] is '1', then left is the index of the first '1' in s starting from the second character, cost is the original cost plus the difference between right and left plus one, and right is the index of the first '0' in s starting from the second character, and s[right] is '1' and s[left] is '0'. Otherwise, left, cost, and right remain unchanged, and s[left] is '1'.
Code of the loop:
while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
    right += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sChar` has at least three characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `right` is increased by 1, and `s[right - 1]` must not be '0'
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `sChar` has at least three characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `right` is increased by 2 and `right` must be less than `len(s)`, and `s[right-1]` must not be '0'
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `sChar` has at least three characters, `s` is a list containing all characters of the original `sChar` string, `i` is the last character in the original `sChar` string, `right` is increased by 1 and is less than `len(s)`, and `s[right]` is not '0'


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
