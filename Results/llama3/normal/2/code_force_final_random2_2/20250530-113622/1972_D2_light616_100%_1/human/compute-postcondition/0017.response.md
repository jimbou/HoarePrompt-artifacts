Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is `n + 1`, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n // ((1 + i) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + i) * i)` for all `i` from 2 to `n` inclusive where the greatest common divisor of 1 and `i` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The values of `y` and `cnt` remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code. The value of `y` is still `n + 1`, and the value of `cnt` is still the sum of the minimum of `n // ((1 + i) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + i) * i)` for all `i` from 2 to `n` inclusive where the greatest common divisor of 1 and `i` is 1.
