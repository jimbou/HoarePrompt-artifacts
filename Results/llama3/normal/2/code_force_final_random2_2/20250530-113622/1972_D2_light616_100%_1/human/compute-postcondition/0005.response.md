The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^6), `_` is 2, `t` must be greater than 2, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**
