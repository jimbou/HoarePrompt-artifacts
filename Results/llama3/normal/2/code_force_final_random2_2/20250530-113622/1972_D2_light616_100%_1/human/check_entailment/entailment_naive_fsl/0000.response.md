Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is designed to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
* b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b

The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes a single test case as input and calculates the number of valid pairs. `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

The key insight in the program is the use of the fact that `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b` if and only if `a` and `b` have no common factors other than 1. This is because `gcd(a, b)` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`, and if `a` and `b` have no common factors other than 1, then `gcd(a, b)` is 1.

The program uses a loop to iterate over all possible values of `x` and `y` such that `x * x <= n` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. For each pair `(x, y)`, it checks if `gcd(x, y)` is 1, and if so, it increments the count of valid pairs by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where `n` or `m` is 1. The use of `min` to calculate the count of valid pairs ensures that the program does not overcount pairs that satisfy the conditions.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all test cases.
