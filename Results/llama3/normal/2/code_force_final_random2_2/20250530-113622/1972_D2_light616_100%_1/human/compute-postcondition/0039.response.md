To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved accordingly. The loop head involves variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`, with the conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.

Given the initial states:
- `x` is 3
- `y` is 1
- `n` is greater than 9
- `m` is greater than or equal to 20
- `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n // ((1 + i) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + i) * i)` for all `i` from 2 to `n` inclusive where the greatest common divisor of 1 and `i` is 1, increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + 2) * 2)`, `m // ((2 + 2) * 2)`, `n // ((2 + 3) * 3)`, `m // ((2 + 3) * 3)`, `n // ((2 + 4) * 4)`, `m // ((2 + 4) * 4)`, `n // ((2 + 5) * 5)`, `m // ((2 + 5) * 5)`

Let's analyze the conditions:

1. `(x + y) * x <= n`:
   - With `x` being 3 and `y` being 1, `x + y` equals 4.
   - So, `4 * 3` must be less than or equal to `n`.
   - This means `12` must be less than or equal to `n`.

2. `(x + y) * y <= m`:
   - With `x` being 3 and `y` being 1, `x + y` equals 4.
   - So, `4 * 1` must be less than or equal to `m`.
   - This means `4` must be less than or equal to `m`.

Given these conditions, we can see that `n` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is at least 12 (since 12 must be less than or equal to `n`), and `m` is already greater than or equal to 20, which satisfies the condition that `4` must be less than or equal to `m`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:
- `x` is 3
- `y` is 1
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 12
- `m` is greater than or equal to 20
- The state of `cnt` does not affect the loop condition, so it remains unchanged.

State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 12, `m` is greater than or equal to 20, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n // ((1 + i) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + i) * i)` for all `i` from 2 to `n` inclusive where the greatest common divisor of 1 and `i` is 1, increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + 2) * 2)`, `m // ((2 + 2) * 2)`, `n // ((2 + 3) * 3)`, `m // ((2 + 3) * 3)`, `n // ((2 + 4) * 4)`, `m // ((2 + 4) * 4)`, `n // ((2 + 5) * 5)`, `m // ((2 + 5) * 5)`**
