Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^6), `_` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**

The code snippet `func_1()` does not modify any variables or read from stdin. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that the function `func_1()` has been executed.
