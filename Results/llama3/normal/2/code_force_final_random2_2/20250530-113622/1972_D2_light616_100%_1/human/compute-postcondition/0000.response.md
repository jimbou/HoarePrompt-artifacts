The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `t` to be the integer accepted from the input. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) first and that integer is assigned into `t`. So stdin now contains `t` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^6). The value of `t` is between 1 and 10^4. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^6).
Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^6)**
