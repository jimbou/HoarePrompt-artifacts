To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop statement and adjust the states accordingly.

The loop statement is:
```
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```
We have two conditions:

1. `(x + y) * x <= n`
2. `(x + y) * y <= m`

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:

* `x` is 2
* `y` is 2
* `n` is greater than or equal to 6
* `m` is greater than or equal to 3

Let's analyze each condition:

1. `(x + y) * x <= n`:
Since `x` is 2 and `y` is 2, `(x + y) * x` is `(2 + 2) * 2 = 8`. To ensure this condition is still true, `n` must be greater than or equal to 8.

2. `(x + y) * y <= m`:
Similarly, `(x + y) * y` is `(2 + 2) * 2 = 8`. To ensure this condition is still true, `m` must be greater than or equal to 8.

We don't need to adjust `x` or `y` since they are not part of the loop head. We only need to adjust `n` and `m` to ensure the conditions are still true.

State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 8, `m` is greater than or equal to 8, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n // ((1 + i) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + i) * i)` for all `i` from 2 to `n` inclusive where the greatest common divisor of 1 and `i` is 1, and `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + 1) * 2)` and `m // ((2 + 1) * 1)`**
