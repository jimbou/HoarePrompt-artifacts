Postcondition: ***`x` is 2, `y` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 8, `m` is greater than or equal to 8. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n // ((1 + i) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + i) * i)` for all `i` from 2 to `n` inclusive where the greatest common divisor of 1 and `i` is 1, increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + 2) * 2)` and `m // ((2 + 2) * 2)`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains the sum of the minimum of `n // ((1 + i) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + i) * i)` for all `i` from 2 to `n` inclusive where the greatest common divisor of 1 and `i` is 1, increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + 1) * 2)` and `m // ((2 + 1) * 1)`.***
