Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^6), `_` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**

Since the code snippet only calls the function `func_1()` without providing its implementation, we cannot determine the exact changes made to the variables. However, we can conclude that the function has been executed, and the initial state remains the same, with the addition of the function call.
