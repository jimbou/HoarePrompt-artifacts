To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop statement and adjust the states of `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m` accordingly.

The conditions are `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. To guarantee that the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that these conditions remain true after the next iteration.

Given the current states:
- `x` is 3
- `y` is 2
- `n` is greater than or equal to 12
- `m` is greater than or equal to 20
- `cnt` is a complex expression but does not affect the loop condition directly

We need to adjust the states so that the conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` can still be true after the next iteration.

1. For `(x + y) * x <= n`:
   - Currently, `x` is 3 and `y` is 2, so `(3 + 2) * 3 = 15`.
   - To ensure this condition can be true again, `n` must be greater than 15 because `x` and `y` could increase in the next iteration.

2. For `(x + y) * y <= m`:
   - Currently, `x` is 3 and `y` is 2, so `(3 + 2) * 2 = 10`.
   - To ensure this condition can be true again, `m` must be greater than 10 because `x` and `y` could increase in the next iteration.

However, since `m` is already greater than or equal to 20, which is more than sufficient for the current value of `y` and any potential increase in `x` and `y`, we do not need to adjust `m` further based on the given condition.

Therefore, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure `n` is greater than 15 to guarantee that the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 2, `n` must be greater than 15, `m` is greater than or equal to 20, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n // ((1 + i) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + i) * i)` for all `i` from 2 to `n` inclusive where the greatest common divisor of 1 and `i` is 1, increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + 2) * 2)`, `m // ((2 + 2) * 2)`, `n // ((2 + 3) * 3)`, `m // ((2 + 3) * 3)`, `n // ((2 + 4) * 4)`, `m // ((2 + 4) * 4)`, `n // ((2 + 5) * 5)`, `m // ((2 + 5) * 5)`, and the minimum of `n // ((3 + 1) * 3)` and `m // ((3 + 1) * 1)`**
