Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 8, `m` is greater than or equal to 8, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n // ((1 + i) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + i) * i)` for all `i` from 2 to `n` inclusive where the greatest common divisor of 1 and `i` is 1, increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + 2) * 2)` and `m // ((2 + 2) * 2)`**

In natural language, the output state is: `x` and `y` remain unchanged at 2, `n` and `m` are still greater than or equal to 8, and `cnt` has been updated to include the minimum of `n // 8` and `m // 8` in addition to its previous value.
