Output State: **x is the square root of n rounded up, y is n + 1, cnt is the sum of the minimum of n // ((i + j) * i) and m // ((i + j) * j) for all i from 1 to the square root of n rounded up inclusive and all j from 1 to n inclusive where the greatest common divisor of i and j is 1.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of x will be the square root of n rounded up, the value of y will be n + 1, and the value of cnt will be the sum of the minimum of n // ((i + j) * i) and m // ((i + j) * j) for all i from 1 to the square root of n rounded up inclusive and all j from 1 to n inclusive where the greatest common divisor of i and j is 1.
