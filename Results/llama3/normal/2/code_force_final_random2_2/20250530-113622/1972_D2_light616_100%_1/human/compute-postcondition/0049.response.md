To calculate the output state, let's break down the given code and initial state.

Initial State: `x` is 3, `y` is 3, `n` must be greater than 36, `m` is greater than or equal to 20

Given Code:
```python
cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

First, let's calculate the values inside the `min` function:

- `x + y` equals 3 + 3, which is 6.
- `n // ((x + y) * x)` equals `n // (6 * 3)`, which simplifies to `n // 18`. Since `n` must be greater than 36, `n // 18` will be at least 2 (because 36 divided by 18 equals 2).
- `m // ((x + y) * y)` equals `m // (6 * 3)`, which simplifies to `m // 18`. Since `m` is greater than or equal to 20, `m // 18` will be at least 1 (because 20 divided by 18 equals approximately 1.11, and since we're using integer division, it rounds down to 1).

Now, let's consider the `min` function. Given the minimum values calculated above (2 for `n // 18` and 1 for `m // 18`), `min(n // 18, m // 18)` will be at least 1 because we're taking the minimum of at least 2 and at least 1.

The code increments `cnt` by this minimum value. However, the initial value of `cnt` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can only conclude that `cnt` is increased by at least 1.

Output State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 3, `n` is greater than 36, `m` is greater than or equal to 20, and `cnt` is increased by at least 1.**
