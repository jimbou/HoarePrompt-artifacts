Output State: **`_` is `t-1`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t - t` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^6), and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop variable `_` has reached its final value, which is one less than the initial value of `t`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the stdin still contains the same number of lines as before, but now all lines have been processed by the loop. The function `func_1()` has been executed for each iteration of the loop.
