Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a specific problem that involves calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying certain conditions based on the input integers n and m. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

Function func_1 reads two positive integers n and m from the standard input, calculates the sum of the minimum of n // ((i + j) * i) and m // ((i + j) * j) for all i from 1 to the square root of n rounded up inclusive and all j from 1 to n inclusive where the greatest common divisor of i and j is 1, and prints the result. This function seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Function func_2 reads an integer t from standard input, then reads t lines of input, each containing two positive integers n and m, and executes the function func_1() for each line, without returning any value or modifying the input variables. This function acts as a test harness, allowing the program to process multiple test cases.

Based on the provided execution summaries, it appears that both functions are working as intended. The program correctly reads input, processes it according to the problem's requirements, and produces the expected output.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the program seems to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
