To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. Since `_` is initially 0, the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `t` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 1. The value of `t` remains the same, but since `_` is now 1, `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

The state of `stdin` and the function `func_1()` is not relevant to the loop head, so we don't need to adjust those states.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^6), `_` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**
