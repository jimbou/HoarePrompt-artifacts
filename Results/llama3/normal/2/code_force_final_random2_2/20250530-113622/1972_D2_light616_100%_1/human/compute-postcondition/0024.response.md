Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 6, `m` is greater than or equal to 3. `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n // ((1 + i) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + i) * i)` for all `i` from 2 to `n` inclusive where the greatest common divisor of 1 and `i` is 1. Since `x` and `y` are coprime, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + 1) * 2)` and `m // ((2 + 1) * 1)`.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `y` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. The values of `x`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The value of `cnt` is still calculated based on the same formula, but since `x` and `y` are now coprime, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + 1) * 2)` and `m // ((2 + 1) * 1)`.
