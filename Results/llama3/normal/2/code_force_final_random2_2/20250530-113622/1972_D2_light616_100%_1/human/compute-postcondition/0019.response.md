Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 1, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n // ((1 + i) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + i) * i)` for all `i` from 2 to `n` inclusive where the greatest common divisor of 1 and `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to 1, while the values of `x`, `cnt`, and `n` remain unchanged. The relationship between `cnt` and `n` is still valid, and `n` is still greater than or equal to 4.
