The `print(cnt)` statement will print the calculated value of `cnt`, which is the sum of the minimum of `n // ((i + j) * i)` and `m // ((i + j) * j)` for all `i` from 1 to the square root of `n` rounded up inclusive and all `j` from 1 to `n` inclusive where the greatest common divisor of `i` and `j` is 1.

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `cnt`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated sum.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the sum of the minimum of n // ((i + j) * i) and m // ((i + j) * j) for all i from 1 to the square root of n rounded up inclusive and all j from 1 to n inclusive where the greatest common divisor of i and j is 1)**
