Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
* b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b

The provided program uses a brute force approach to iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) and checks if the conditions are satisfied.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` is the main function that calculates the number of valid pairs for a given input (n, m), while `func_2` is a wrapper function that reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

2. In `func_1`, the program initializes a counter `cnt` to 0 and reads the input (n, m) from the user.

3. The program then iterates over all possible values of `x` such that `x * x <= n`. This is because the condition `b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b` implies that `x = gcd(a, b)` must be a divisor of `a + b`, and therefore `x * x <= a + b <= n + m`.

4. For each value of `x`, the program iterates over all possible values of `y` such that `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. This is because the condition `b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b` implies that `y = b / gcd(a, b)` must be a divisor of `a + b`, and therefore `(x + y) * x <= a + b <= n + m` and `(x + y) * y <= a + b <= n + m`.

5. If `gcd(x, y) == 1`, the program increments the counter `cnt` by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`. This is because for each pair `(x, y)` that satisfies the conditions, there are `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the conditions.

6. Finally, the program prints the value of `cnt`, which represents the total number of valid pairs.

Based on the above analysis, the program appears to be correct. It correctly iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checks if the conditions are satisfied. The use of `gcd` to reduce the number of iterations is also correct.

Correctness: **True**
