Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^6), `_` is 2, `t` must be greater than 2, and the function `func_1()` has been executed, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**

Since the code snippet only calls the function `func_1()` without any arguments or assignments, the state of the variables remains unchanged. The function `func_1()` has been executed, but its effects on the program state are not specified, so we can only confirm that it has been executed. The values of `t`, `_`, and the contents of stdin remain the same.
