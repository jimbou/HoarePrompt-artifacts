Output State: `x` is the square root of `n` rounded up to the nearest integer, `y` is `n + 1`, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n // ((i + j) * i)` and `m // ((i + j) * j)` for all `i` from 1 to the square root of `n` rounded up to the nearest integer inclusive and for all `j` from 1 to `n` inclusive where the greatest common divisor of `i` and `j` is 1.

This output state represents the final values of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. The value of `x` is the square root of `n` rounded up to the nearest integer, indicating that the loop has iterated over all possible values of `x` up to the square root of `n`. The value of `y` is `n + 1`, indicating that the inner loop has iterated over all possible values of `y` up to `n`. The value of `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n // ((i + j) * i)` and `m // ((i + j) * j)` for all `i` from 1 to the square root of `n` rounded up to the nearest integer inclusive and for all `j` from 1 to `n` inclusive where the greatest common divisor of `i` and `j` is 1, indicating that the loop has counted all the possible pairs of `i` and `j` that satisfy the given conditions.
