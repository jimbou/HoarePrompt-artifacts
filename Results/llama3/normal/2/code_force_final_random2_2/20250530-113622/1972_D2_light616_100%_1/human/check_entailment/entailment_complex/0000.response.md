Reasoning:

The problem statement requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
* b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b

The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` reads two positive integers n and m from the standard input, calculates the sum of the minimum of n // ((i + j) * i) and m // ((i + j) * j) for all i from 1 to the square root of n rounded up inclusive and all j from 1 to n inclusive where the greatest common divisor of i and j is 1, and prints the result.

`func_2` reads an integer t from standard input, then reads t lines of input, each containing two positive integers n and m, and executes the function `func_1` for each line.

The program correctly implements the required logic:

* `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the minimum of n // ((i + j) * i) and m // ((i + j) * j) for all i from 1 to the square root of n rounded up inclusive and all j from 1 to n inclusive where the greatest common divisor of i and j is 1.
* `func_2` correctly reads the input and executes `func_1` for each test case.

The program does not have any syntax errors or logical flaws. The use of `math.gcd` to calculate the greatest common divisor is correct. The loop conditions and variable updates are also correct.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem.

Correctness: **True**
