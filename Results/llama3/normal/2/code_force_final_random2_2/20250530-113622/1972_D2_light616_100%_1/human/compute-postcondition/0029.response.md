Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 8, `m` is greater than or equal to 8. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n // ((1 + i) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + i) * i)` for all `i` from 2 to `n` inclusive where the greatest common divisor of 1 and `i` is 1, increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + 3) * 3)` and `m // ((2 + 3) * 3)`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains the sum of the minimum of `n // ((1 + i) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + i) * i)` for all `i` from 2 to `n` inclusive where the greatest common divisor of 1 and `i` is 1, increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + 2) * 2)` and `m // ((2 + 2) * 2)`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `y` being 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `cnt` are updated accordingly, with the new value of `y` being used in the calculations.
