Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 1, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n // ((1 + i) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + i) * i)` for all `i` from 2 to `n` inclusive where the greatest common divisor of 1 and `i` is 1, plus the minimum of `n // ((2 + 1) * 2)` and `m // ((2 + 1) * 1)`, `n` is greater than or equal to 6, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, and `x` and `y` are coprime.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` is still 2, the value of `y` is still 1, and the value of `cnt` has been updated by adding the minimum of `n // ((2 + 1) * 2)` and `m // ((2 + 1) * 1)` to its previous value. The conditions on `n` and `m` remain the same, and `x` and `y` are still coprime.
