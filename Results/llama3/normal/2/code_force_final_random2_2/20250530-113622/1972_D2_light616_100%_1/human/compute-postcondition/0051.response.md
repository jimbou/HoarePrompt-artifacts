Output State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 4, `n` is greater than 36, `m` is greater than or equal to 20. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is increased by at least 1.**

The value of `y` is incremented by 1, so it changes from 3 to 4. The values of the other variables are not affected. The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is still 1, so `cnt` is still increased by at least 1.
