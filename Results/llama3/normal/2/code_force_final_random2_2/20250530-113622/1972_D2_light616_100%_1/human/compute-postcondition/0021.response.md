Postcondition: **`x` is 2, `y` is 1, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n // ((1 + i) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + i) * i)` for all `i` from 2 to `n` inclusive where the greatest common divisor of 1 and `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 6, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3. The current value of `x` and `y` are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1).**
