Postcondition: ***`x` is 2, `y` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 6, `m` is greater than or equal to 3. `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n // ((1 + i) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + i) * i)` for all `i` from 2 to `n` inclusive where the greatest common divisor of 1 and `i` is 1. If `x` and `y` are coprime, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + 1) * 2)` and `m // ((2 + 1) * 1)`.***
