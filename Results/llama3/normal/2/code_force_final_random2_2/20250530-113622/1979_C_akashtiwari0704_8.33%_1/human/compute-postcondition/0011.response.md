Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `bets` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers, `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is `bets-1`, `sumo` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `sumo` that is initialized to 0. The values of `t`, `T`, `bets`, `a`, `prod`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged.
