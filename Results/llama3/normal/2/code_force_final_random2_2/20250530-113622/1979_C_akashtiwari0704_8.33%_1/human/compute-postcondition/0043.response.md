Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 1, `bets` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers, `prod` is the product of its original value and all integers in `a`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is `bets`, `sumo` is the sum of the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i` and its original value at index `i` plus the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i` plus the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i` plus ... (bets times)**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer greater than 0, `T` remains 1, `bets` remains a non-negative integer, `a` remains a list of integers, `prod` becomes the product of its original value and all integers in `a`, `stdin` still contains no input, `i` becomes equal to `bets`, and `sumo` becomes the sum of the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i` and its original value at index `i` plus the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i` plus the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i` plus ... (bets times).
