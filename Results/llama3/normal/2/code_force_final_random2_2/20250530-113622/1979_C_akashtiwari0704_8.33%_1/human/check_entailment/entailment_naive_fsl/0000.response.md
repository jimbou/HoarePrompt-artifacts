Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input is a list of identical numbers. In this case, the program will output -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. However, it is actually possible to distribute the coins by betting one coin on each outcome.

For example, if the input is [3, 3, 3], the program will output -1, but a correct solution would be to bet one coin on each outcome, resulting in a total of 3 coins bet and a return of 3 * 3 = 9 coins for each outcome, which is strictly greater than the total amount of coins bet.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
