Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 1, `bets` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers with the value at index `i` changed to the product of its original value and all other integers in `a`, `prod` is the product of its original value and all integers in `a`, `i` is `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the sum of its original value and the new values of all `a[i]`, `ans` is an empty string, and the sum of the original value and the new values of all `a[i]` is less than the product of its original value and all integers in `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(bets):
    ans += str(a[i]) + ' '


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 1, `bets` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with the value at index `i` changed to the product of its original value and all other integers in `a`, `prod` is the product of its original value and all integers in `a`, `i` is 0, `sumo` is the sum of its original value and the new values of all `a[i]`, `ans` is a string containing the string representation of the value of `a[i]` followed by a space, and the sum of the original value and the new values of all `a[i]` is less than the product of its original value and all integers in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 1, `bets` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers with the value at index `i` changed to the product of its original value and all other integers in `a`, `prod` is the product of its original value and all integers in `a`, `i` is 1, `sumo` is the sum of its original value and the new values of all `a[i]`, `ans` is a string containing the string representation of the value of `a[i]` followed by a space, and the sum of the original value and the new values of all `a[i]` is less than the product of its original value and all integers in `a`, and `ans` is appended with the string representation of the new value of `a[i]` followed by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 1, `bets` is a positive integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers with the value at index `i` changed to the product of its original value and all other integers in `a`, `prod` is the product of its original value and all integers in `a`, `i` is 2, `sumo` is the sum of its original value and the new values of all `a[i]`, `ans` is a string containing the string representation of the value of `a[i]` followed by a space, the string representation of the new value of `a[i]` followed by a space, and the sum of the original value and the new values of all `a[i]` is less than the product of its original value and all integers in `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
