Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `bets` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index `i` is the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i`, `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`, `i` is `bets-1`, `sumo` is the sum of the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i` and its original value at index `i` plus the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i` plus the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i` plus ... (`bets` times), `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is an empty string.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `ans` which is an empty string. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
