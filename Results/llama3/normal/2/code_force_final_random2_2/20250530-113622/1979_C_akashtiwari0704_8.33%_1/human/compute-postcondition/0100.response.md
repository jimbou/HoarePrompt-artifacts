Output State: **t is 0, T is t, bets is a non-negative integer, a is a list of integers with the value at index i changed to the product of its original value and all other integers in a divided by its original value, prod is the product of its original value and the values of a at indices 0 through bets-1, stdin contains no input, i is bets-1, sumo is the sum of the product of its original value and all other integers in a divided by its original value plus the integer value of a[i] for all i in range(bets). If sumo is greater than or equal to prod, -1 is printed. Otherwise, sumo is less than prod, ans is a string containing the string representation of the integer at index i of a followed by a space for all i in range(bets), and the string representation of all integers in the list a, each followed by a space is being printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is such that the loop has finished executing all the test cases. The variable `t` is now 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variable `T` is equal to the initial value of `t`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The variable `bets` is a non-negative integer, indicating that it has been updated with the number of bets in the last test case. The list `a` has been updated with the product of each element and all other elements in the list, divided by its original value. The variable `prod` is the product of the original value and the values of `a` at indices 0 through `bets-1`. The standard input `stdin` is empty, indicating that all input has been processed. The variable `i` is equal to `bets-1`, indicating that the loop has finished processing the last bet. The variable `sumo` is the sum of the product of each element and all other elements in the list, divided by its original value, plus the integer value of `a[i]` for all `i` in range `bets`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the output is `-1`. Otherwise, the output is the string representation of all integers in the list `a`, each followed by a space.
