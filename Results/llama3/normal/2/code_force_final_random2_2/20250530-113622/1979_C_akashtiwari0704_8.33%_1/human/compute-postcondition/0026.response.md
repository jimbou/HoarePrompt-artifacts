To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `bets`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `bets`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `bets` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `bets` remains the same.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `bets` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index `i` is the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i`, `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`, `i` is 1, `sumo` is the sum of the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i` and its original value at index `i` plus the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i` plus the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i` plus ... (`bets` times), `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the string representation of the integer at index `i` of `a` followed by a space.**
