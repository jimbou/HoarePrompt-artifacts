Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, T is 2, bets is a non-negative integer, a is a list of integers with the value at index i changed to the product of its original value and all other integers in a divided by its original value, prod is the product of its original value and the values of a at indices 0 through bets-1, stdin contains no input, i is bets-1, sumo is the sum of the product of its original value and all other integers in a divided by its original value plus the integer value of a[i] for all i in range(bets). If sumo is greater than or equal to prod, -1 is printed. Otherwise, sumo is less than prod, ans is a string containing the string representation of the integer at index i of a followed by a space for all i in range(bets), and the string representation of all integers in the list a, each followed by a space is being printed.**
