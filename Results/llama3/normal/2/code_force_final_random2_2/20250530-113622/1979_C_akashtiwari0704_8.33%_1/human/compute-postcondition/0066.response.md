Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0, T is 1, bets is a non-negative integer, a is a list of integers with the value at index i changed to the product of its original value and all other integers in a, prod is the product of its original value and all integers in a, stdin contains no input, i is bets - 1, sumo is the sum of its original value and the new values of all a[i]. If sumo is greater than or equal to prod, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the string representation of the values of a[i] for each i in range bets is being printed.***
