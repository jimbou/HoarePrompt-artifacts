Output: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `bets` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index `i` is the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i`, `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`, `i` is `bets-1`, `sumo` is the sum of the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i` and its original value at index `i` plus the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i` plus the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i` plus ... (`bets` times), `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the string representation of the integer at index `i` of `a` followed by a space, followed by the string representation of the integer at index `i` of `a` followed by a space, followed by the string representation of the integer at index `i` of `a` followed by a space, ... (`bets` times), and this is printed: a string containing the string representation of the integer at index `i` of `a` followed by a space, followed by the string representation of the integer at index `i` of `a` followed by a space, followed by the string representation of the integer at index `i` of `a` followed by a space, ... (`bets` times)**
