Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer n followed by n integers. It calculates the product of all integers in each test case, then for each integer, it calculates the product of all other integers divided by the current integer. If the sum of these calculated values is greater than or equal to the product of all integers, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the calculated values for each integer in the test case, separated by spaces.**
