Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 2, `bets` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers with the value at index `i` changed to the product of its original value and all other integers in `a` divided by its original value, `prod` is the product of its original value and the values of `a` at indices 0 through `bets-1`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is `bets-1`, `sumo` is the sum of the product of its original value and all other integers in `a` divided by its original value plus the integer value of `a[i]` for all `i` in range(`bets`), `sumo` is less than `prod`, and `ans` is an empty string.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `ans` which is an empty string. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
