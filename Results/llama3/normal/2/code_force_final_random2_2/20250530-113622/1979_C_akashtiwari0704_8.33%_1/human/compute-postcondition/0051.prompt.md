Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 1, `bets` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers, `prod` is the product of its original value and all integers in `a`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is `bets`, `sumo` is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(bets):
    a[i] = prod // a[i]
    sumo += int(a[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 0, T is 1, bets is at least 1, a is a list of integers with the value at index i changed to prod // a[i], prod is the product of its original value and all integers in a, stdin contains no input, i is 0, sumo is the sum of its original value and the new value of a[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 0, T is 1, bets is at least 2, a is a list of integers with the value at index i changed to prod // a[i], prod is the product of its original value and all integers in a, stdin contains no input, i is 1, sumo is the sum of its original value, the new value of a[i], and the new value of a[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 0, T is 1, bets is at least 3, a is a list of integers with the value at index i changed to the product of its original value and all other integers in a, sumo is the sum of its original value, the new value of a[i], and the new value of a[i], i is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
