Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `bets` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index `i` is the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i`, `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`, `i` is 1, `sumo` is the sum of the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i` and its original value at index `i` plus the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i` plus the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i` plus ... (`bets` times), `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the string representation of the integer at index `i` of `a` followed by a space, followed by the string representation of the integer at index `i` of `a` followed by a space.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the string `ans` now contains an additional string representation of the integer at index `i` of `a`, followed by a space.
