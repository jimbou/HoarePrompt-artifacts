The `print(ans)` statement will print a string containing the string representation of the value of `a[i]` followed by a space for each `i` in range `bets`. 

Here, `a[i]` is the value at index `i` in the list `a`, which is changed to the product of its original value and all other integers in `a`. 

Since `i` is `bets`, the string `ans` will contain the string representation of the value of `a[bets]` followed by a space for each `bets` in range `bets`. 

However, the exact values of `a[bets]` and `bets` are not provided, so we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. 

But based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output a string containing the string representation of the value of `a[bets]` followed by a space for each `bets` in range `bets`.

Output: **a string containing the string representation of the value of a[bets] followed by a space for each bets in range bets**
