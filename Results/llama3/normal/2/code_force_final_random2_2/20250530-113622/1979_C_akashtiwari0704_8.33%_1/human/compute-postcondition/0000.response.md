Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,...,k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20).**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first input, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), and the second line contains `n` integers `k_1,k_2,...,k_n` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20).
