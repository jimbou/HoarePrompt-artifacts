Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,...,k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20).
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):
    bets = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    prod = 1
    for i in range(bets):
        prod *= a[i]
    sumo = 0
    for i in range(bets):
        a[i] = prod // a[i]
        sumo += int(a[i])
    if sumo >= prod:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = ''
        for i in range(bets):
            ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 0, T is 0, bets is a non-negative integer, a is a list of integers where the element at index i is the integer division of prod by its original value at index i, prod is the product of the first bets elements of a, stdin contains no input, i is bets-1, sumo is the sum of the integer division of prod by its original value at index i and its original value at index i plus the integer division of prod by its original value at index i plus the integer division of prod by its original value at index i plus ... (bets times). If sumo is greater than or equal to prod, -1 is printed. Otherwise, a string containing the string representation of the integer at index i of a followed by a space, followed by the string representation of the integer at index i of a followed by a space, followed by the string representation of the integer at index i of a followed by a space, ... (bets times) is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 0, T is 1, bets is a non-negative integer, a is a list of integers with the value at index i changed to the product of its original value and all other integers in a, prod is the product of its original value and all integers in a, stdin contains no input, i is bets - 1, sumo is the sum of its original value and the new values of all a[i]. If sumo is greater than or equal to prod, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the string representation of the values of a[i] for each i in range bets is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 1, T is 2, bets is a non-negative integer, a is a list of integers with the value at index i changed to the product of its original value and all other integers in a divided by its original value, prod is the product of its original value and the values of a at indices 0 through bets-1, stdin contains no input, i is bets-1, sumo is the sum of the product of its original value and all other integers in a divided by its original value plus the integer value of a[i] for all i in range(bets). If sumo is greater than or equal to prod, -1 is printed. Otherwise, sumo is less than prod, ans is a string containing the string representation of the integer at index i of a followed by a space for all i in range(bets), and the string representation of all integers in the list a, each followed by a space is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
