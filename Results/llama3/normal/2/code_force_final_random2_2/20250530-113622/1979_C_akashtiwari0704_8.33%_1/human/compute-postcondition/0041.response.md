Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 1, `bets` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `prod` is the product of its original value and the integer at index 0 of `a` and the integer at index 1 of `a` and the integer at index 2 of `a`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 2, `sumo` is the sum of the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index 0 and its original value at index 0 plus the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index 0 plus the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index 0 plus ... (bets times)**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `prod` has been updated to include the product of its original value and the integer at index 2 of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
