Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, T is 0, bets is a non-negative integer, a is a list of integers where the element at index i is the integer division of prod by its original value at index i, prod is the product of the first bets elements of a, stdin contains no input, i is bets-1, sumo is the sum of the integer division of prod by its original value at index i and its original value at index i plus the integer division of prod by its original value at index i plus the integer division of prod by its original value at index i plus ... (bets times). If sumo is greater than or equal to prod, -1 is printed. Otherwise, a string containing the string representation of the integer at index i of a followed by a space, followed by the string representation of the integer at index i of a followed by a space, followed by the string representation of the integer at index i of a followed by a space, ... (bets times) is printed.**
