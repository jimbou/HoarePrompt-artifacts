Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy to distribute the coins in such a way that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome.

The program first calculates the product of all the multipliers in the test case. Then, for each multiplier, it calculates the product of all other multipliers divided by the current multiplier. This is done to ensure that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

If the sum of these calculated values is greater than or equal to the product of all multipliers, it means that there is no way to distribute the coins as required, and the program prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the calculated values for each multiplier in the test case, separated by spaces.

The program correctly handles the constraints given in the problem description, including the range of the number of outcomes (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and the range of the multipliers (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20). It also correctly handles the case where there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

Correctness: **True**
