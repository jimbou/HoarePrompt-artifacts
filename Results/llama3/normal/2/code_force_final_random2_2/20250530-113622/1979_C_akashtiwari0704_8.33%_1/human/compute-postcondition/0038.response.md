The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `bets`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `bets`. If `i` is less than `bets`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `bets` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `bets` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 1, `bets` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `prod` is the product of its original value and the integer at index 0 of `a`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 1, `sumo` is the sum of the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index 0 and its original value at index 0 plus the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index 0 plus the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index 0 plus ...
