To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `bets`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `bets`. If `i` is less than `bets`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `bets` is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `bets` remains the same, but since `i` is now 2, `bets` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `bets` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index `i` is the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i`, `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`, `i` is 2, `sumo` is the sum of the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i` and its original value at index `i` plus the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i` plus the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i` plus ... (`bets` times), `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the string representation of the integer at index `i` of `a` followed by a space, followed by the string representation of the integer at index `i` of `a` followed by a space.**
