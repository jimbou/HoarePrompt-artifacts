Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy to distribute the coins in such a way that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program calculates the product of all multipliers, then for each multiplier, it calculates the product of all other multipliers divided by the current multiplier. This ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program also correctly handles the case where there is no way to distribute the coins as required, in which case it prints -1.

Correctness: **True**
