Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 1, `bets` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `prod` is the product of its original value and the integer at index 0 of `a`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 0, `sumo` is the sum of the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index 0 and its original value at index 0 plus the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index 0 plus the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index 0 plus ... (bets times)**

In this output state, the value of `prod` has been updated to be the product of its original value (which was 1) and the integer at index 0 of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `sumo` is still dependent on the original value of `prod`, which was 1, and the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index 0, which is now the integer at index 0 of `a`.
