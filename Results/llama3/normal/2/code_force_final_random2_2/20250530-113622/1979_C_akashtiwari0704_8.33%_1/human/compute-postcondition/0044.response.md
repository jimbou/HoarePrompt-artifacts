Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 1, `bets` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers, `prod` is the product of its original value and all integers in `a`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is `bets`, `sumo` is 0**

The value of `sumo` has been reset to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `sumo` is no longer the sum of the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i` and its original value at index `i` plus the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i` plus the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i` plus ... (bets times). Instead, it is now 0.
