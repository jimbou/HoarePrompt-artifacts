Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `bets` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index `i` is the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i`, `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`, `i` is `bets-1`, `sumo` is the sum of the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i` and its original value at index `i` plus the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i` plus the integer division of `prod` by its original value at index `i` plus ... (`bets` times), `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the string representation of the integer at index `i` of `a` followed by a space, followed by the string representation of the integer at index `i` of `a` followed by a space, followed by the string representation of the integer at index `i` of `a` followed by a space, ... (`bets` times).**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state is such that `t` and `T` remain unchanged, `bets` is greater than or equal to 0 (since the loop may execute 0 times if `bets` is 0), `a` remains the same list of integers, `prod` remains the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`, `i` is now `bets-1` (since the loop iterates `bets` times), `sumo` remains the sum of the integer divisions of `prod` by its original values at each index, and `ans` is a string containing the string representations of all integers in `a`, each followed by a space.
