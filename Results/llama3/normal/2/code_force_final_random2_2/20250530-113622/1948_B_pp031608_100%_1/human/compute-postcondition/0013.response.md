Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer greater than 1, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 inclusive, i is 2, nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of arr[1] and the last element is arr[2], ans is False.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`. The second line, `break`, is a statement that is typically used to exit a loop prematurely. However, in this context, since there is no loop provided in the code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the program's execution or the state of the variables.

Therefore, the only change to the initial state is the assignment of `False` to the variable `ans`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `arr`, `i`, and `nums`) retain their original values and properties as described in the initial state.
