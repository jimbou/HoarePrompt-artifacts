Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `ans` is True, `i` is `m - 1`, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, and `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged. The new variable `nums` is introduced, which is a list of integers. The first elements of `nums` are the digits of `arr[i - 1]`, and the last element is `arr[i]`. The condition `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]` is still valid.
