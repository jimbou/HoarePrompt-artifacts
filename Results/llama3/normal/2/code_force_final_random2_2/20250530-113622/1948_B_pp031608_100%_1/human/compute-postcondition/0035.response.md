Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is `m - 1`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is set to the first element of `nums` where `nums` is a list of integers with the first elements being the digits of the old value of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element being `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, the state of `ans` remains unchanged. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, then the state of `ans` remains unchanged.***
