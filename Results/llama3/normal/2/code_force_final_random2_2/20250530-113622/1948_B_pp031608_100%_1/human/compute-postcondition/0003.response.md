To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `m`. The loop will execute as long as `m` is greater than 1, since the loop starts from `m - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 1.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 inclusive, `ans` is True, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 50) followed by `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 99), `_` is 0, `i` is `m - 1`**
