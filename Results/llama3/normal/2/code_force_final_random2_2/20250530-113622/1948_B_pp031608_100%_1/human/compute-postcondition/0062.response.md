Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer that must be at least 3, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is 1, `ans` is True, and `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[0]` as integers and `arr[1]`**.

In this output state, the value of `nums` is specifically calculated by first converting `arr[0]` to a string, then iterating over each character in the string (which represents the digits of `arr[0]`), converting each character back to an integer, and finally appending `arr[1]` to the end of the list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
