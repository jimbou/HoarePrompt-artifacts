To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `m`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `m - 1` is greater than 0, which means `m` must be at least 2. Since `i` is already 2, we need to adjust `m` to be at least 3.

State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer that must be at least 3, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is 2, `ans` is True**
