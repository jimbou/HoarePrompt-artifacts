Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 inclusive, ans is True, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), _ is 0**

The code reads an integer `m` from stdin and assigns it to the variable `m`. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` also becomes an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive. The code then reads a list of `n` integers from stdin, splits them into individual integers, and assigns them to the list `arr`. Since each integer `a_i` is between 0 and 99 inclusive, `arr` becomes a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 inclusive. The variable `ans` is assigned the value `True`. The remaining test cases in stdin are reduced by 1, leaving `t-2` test cases. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0.
