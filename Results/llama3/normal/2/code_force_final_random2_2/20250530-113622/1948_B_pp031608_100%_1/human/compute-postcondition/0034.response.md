Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is `m - 1`, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]` which is now equal to the first element of `nums`, and `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the old value of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, the state of `ans` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `arr[i - 1]` has been updated to the first element of `nums`, which is a digit of the old value of `arr[i - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition on `ans` still depends on whether `nums` is sorted in ascending order or not.
