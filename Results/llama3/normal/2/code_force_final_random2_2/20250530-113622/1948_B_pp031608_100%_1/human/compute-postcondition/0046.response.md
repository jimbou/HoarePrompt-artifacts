Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where `arr[i - 1]` is the first digit of the original `arr[i - 1]`, `i` is `m - 3`, and `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `arr[i - 1]` has been updated to be the first digit of its original value, which is now stored in `nums[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition regarding the sortedness of `nums` and the value of `ans` still holds.
