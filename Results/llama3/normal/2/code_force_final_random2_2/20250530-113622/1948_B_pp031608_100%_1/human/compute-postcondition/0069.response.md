Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer that must be at least 2, arr is a list of n integers where arr[0] is equal to nums[0], i is 0, nums is a list containing the digits of arr[-1] as integers and arr[0], and ans is False.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = False` and `break`. The first line sets the value of `ans` to `False`, regardless of its previous value. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop it is in. However, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the state.

Therefore, the only change in the state is that `ans` is now `False`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `arr`, `i`, and `nums`) retain their initial values and properties as described in the initial state.
