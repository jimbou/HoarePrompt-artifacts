Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, m is at least 2, arr is a list of n integers, i is m - 2. If the list of integers nums, where the first elements are the digits of arr[i - 1] and the last element is arr[i], is not sorted, then ans is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
