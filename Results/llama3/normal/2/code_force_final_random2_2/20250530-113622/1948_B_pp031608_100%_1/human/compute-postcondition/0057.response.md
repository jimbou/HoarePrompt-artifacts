Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer that must be at least 3, arr is a list of n integers, i is 2, ans is False, nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of arr[i - 1] and the last element is arr[i].**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`, which was initially `True`. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables or their values.

Therefore, the only change in the output state is the value of `ans`, which is now `False`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `arr`, `i`, and `nums`) retain their initial values and properties as described in the initial state.
