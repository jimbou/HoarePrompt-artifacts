The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again `i` is decreased by 1 so `i` is 0 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer that must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where `arr[0]` is equal to `nums[0]`, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[0]` as integers and `arr[1]`, and `ans` is True if `nums` is sorted in ascending order and `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, otherwise False.**
