To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 2, because the range starts from `m - 1` and goes down to `1`. Since `n` is between 2 and 50 inclusive, and `arr` is a list of `n` integers, these conditions do not affect the execution of the loop directly. The state of `ans` being `True` also does not impact the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `ans` is True, `i` is `m - 1`**
