Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer that must be at least 3, arr is a list of n integers where arr[i - 1] is the first element of nums, i is 2, and nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of arr[i - 1] and the last element is arr[i]. If nums is not sorted in ascending order, ans is False. Otherwise, the state of ans remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of arr[i - 1] has been updated to be the first element of nums. The other variables remain unchanged. The state of ans is still dependent on whether nums is sorted in ascending order or not.
