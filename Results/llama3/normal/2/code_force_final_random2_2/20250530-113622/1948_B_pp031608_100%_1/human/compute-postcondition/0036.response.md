To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `m`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `m - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `m - 2`.

The state of `m` remains unchanged, as it is not modified in the loop body.

The state of `n`, `arr`, `ans`, and `nums` are not relevant to the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is `m - 2`, `ans` is unchanged**
