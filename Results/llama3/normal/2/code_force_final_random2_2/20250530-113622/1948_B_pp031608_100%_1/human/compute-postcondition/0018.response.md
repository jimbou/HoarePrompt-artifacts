Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 inclusive. If the second element of `arr` is less than the first element, the second element of `arr` is replaced by the first digit of `arr[1]`, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, no specific changes are made to the variables.**

The code updates the value of `nums` by taking the digits of `arr[i - 1]` (which is `arr[0]` since `i` is 1) and appending `arr[i]` (which is `arr[1]`) to the list. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
