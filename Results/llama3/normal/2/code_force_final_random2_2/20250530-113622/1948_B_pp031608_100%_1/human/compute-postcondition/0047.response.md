Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is updated to its first digit, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
