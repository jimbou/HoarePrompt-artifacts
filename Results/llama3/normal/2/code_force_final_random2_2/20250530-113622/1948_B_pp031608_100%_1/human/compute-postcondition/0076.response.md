Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer that must be at least 1, arr is a list of n integers where arr[0] is equal to nums[0], i is 0, and ans is True if nums is sorted in ascending order and arr[i] is not less than arr[i - 1], otherwise False. If arr[i] is less than arr[i - 1], then arr[-1] is equal to nums[0], nums is a list containing the digits of arr[-1] as integers and arr[0], and ans is False if nums is not sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, ans is True if nums is sorted in ascending order and arr[0] is not less than arr[-1]., and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times. This is because the loop only executes a fixed number of times (n), and the state of the variables after 3 iterations is the same as the state after n iterations. The loop does not modify the state of the variables in a way that would change the output state after 3 iterations. Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times.
