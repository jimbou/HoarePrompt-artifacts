Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer that must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where `arr[0]` is equal to `nums[0]`, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[-1]` as integers and `arr[0]`, and `ans` is True if `nums` is sorted in ascending order and `arr[0]` is not less than `arr[-1]`, otherwise False.**

In this output state, the value of `nums` has been updated to contain the digits of `arr[-1]` (which is the last element of the list `arr`) as integers and `arr[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `ans` is still dependent on the sorted order of `nums` and the comparison between `arr[0]` and `arr[-1]`.
