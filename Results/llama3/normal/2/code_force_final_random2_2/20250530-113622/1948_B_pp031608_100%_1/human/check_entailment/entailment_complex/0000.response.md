Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to check if the array can be made sorted in non-decreasing order by applying the given operation any number of times. The program iterates through the array from the end to the beginning, and whenever it finds a pair of elements that are not in non-decreasing order, it checks if the digits of the previous element can be rearranged to make the pair sorted. If it finds a pair that cannot be made sorted, it sets the answer to False and breaks the loop. Finally, it prints 'YES' if the answer is True and 'NO' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
