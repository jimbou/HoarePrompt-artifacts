Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 inclusive where the second element is replaced by the first digit of `arr[1]`, `i` is 2, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[1]` and the last element is `arr[2]`. If `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, no specific changes are made to the variables.**

In this output state, the value of `arr[i - 1]` is updated to be the first digit of `arr[1]`, which is the first element of `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition regarding `ans` also remains the same, depending on whether `nums` is sorted or not.
