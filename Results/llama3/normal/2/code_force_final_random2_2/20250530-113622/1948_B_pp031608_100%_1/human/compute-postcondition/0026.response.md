State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 inclusive where the first element is the first digit of the original first element of `arr` if the second element of `arr` is less than the first element, otherwise the state of `arr` remains unchanged, `ans` is False if there exists an `i` such that `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i-1]` and the list of digits of `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]` is not sorted, otherwise `ans` is True, and either 'NO' or 'YES' is printed depending on the value of `ans`**
