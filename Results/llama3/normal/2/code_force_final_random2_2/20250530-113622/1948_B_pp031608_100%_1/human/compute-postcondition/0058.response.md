Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer that must be at least 3, arr is a list of n integers, i is 2, and nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of arr[i - 1] and the last element is arr[i]. If nums is not sorted in ascending order, ans is False. Otherwise, the state of ans remains unchanged.***
