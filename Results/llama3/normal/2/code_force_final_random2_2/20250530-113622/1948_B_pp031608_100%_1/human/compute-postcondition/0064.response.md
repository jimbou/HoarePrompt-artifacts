Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer that must be at least 3, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is 1, and `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[0]` as integers and `arr[1]`. If `nums` is not sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.***
