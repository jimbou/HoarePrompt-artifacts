Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is `m - 3`, `ans` is unchanged, and `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `nums` is a combination of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]`. The digits of `arr[i - 1]` are converted to integers and added to the list, followed by `arr[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
