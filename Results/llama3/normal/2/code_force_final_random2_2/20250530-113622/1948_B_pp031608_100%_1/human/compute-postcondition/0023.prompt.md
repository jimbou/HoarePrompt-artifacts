Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 inclusive, ans is True, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), _ is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 inclusive. If the value at index `i` is less than the value at index `i-1`, then `ans` is False if the list of digits of `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]` is not sorted. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 inclusive. If the second element of `arr` is less than the first element, the second element of `arr` is replaced by the first digit of `arr[1]`, `i` is 2, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[1]` and the last element is `arr[2]`. If `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, no specific changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 inclusive. If the second element of `arr` is less than the first element, the first element of `arr` is replaced by the first digit of the original first element of `arr`, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the original first element of `arr` and the last element is the first digit of the original first element of `arr`, and if `nums` is not sorted then `ans` is False. Otherwise, no specific changes are made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
