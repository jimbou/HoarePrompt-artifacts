The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is 2, `ans` is True or False**
