Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer that must be at least 3, arr is a list of n integers, i is 1, ans is False, and nums is a list containing the digits of arr[0] as integers and arr[1].**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`, changing its initial state from `True` to `False`. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the state of the program.

All other variables (`n`, `m`, `arr`, `i`, and `nums`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet. The initial state of these variables is preserved, and their values are still valid after the execution of the code.
