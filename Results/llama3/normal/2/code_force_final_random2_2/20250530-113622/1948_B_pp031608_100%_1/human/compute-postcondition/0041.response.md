Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is `m - 2`, and `ans` is unchanged. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then the value at index `i - 1` in `arr` is the first digit of the original value at index `i - 1`, and if the list of integers `nums`, where the first elements are the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`, is not sorted, then `ans` is `False`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
