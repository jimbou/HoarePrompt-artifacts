Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, i is 2, ans is True**

The code block consists of three lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `m`. The second line assigns a list of `n` integers from the input to `arr`. The third line assigns `True` to `ans`. 

The initial state of `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, which remains unchanged. The initial state of `m` is an integer, but its value is updated by the first line of the code. The initial state of `arr` is a list of `n` integers, but its value is updated by the second line of the code. The initial state of `i` is 2, which remains unchanged. The initial state of `ans` is True or False, but its value is updated to True by the third line of the code.
