Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, m is at least 2, arr is a list of n integers, i is m - 1, arr[i] is less than arr[i - 1], and nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of arr[i - 1] and the last element is arr[i]. If nums is not sorted in ascending order, then ans is False. Otherwise, the state of ans remains unchanged.***
