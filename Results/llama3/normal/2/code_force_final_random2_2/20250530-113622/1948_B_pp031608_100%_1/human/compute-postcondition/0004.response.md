Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 inclusive, `ans` is True, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 50) followed by `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 99), `_` is 0, `i` is `m - 1`. The current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`.**
