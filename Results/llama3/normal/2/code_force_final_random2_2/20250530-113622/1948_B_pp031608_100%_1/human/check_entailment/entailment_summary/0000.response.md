Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make a sorted array in non-decreasing order using the given operation. The program iterates over the array from the end to the beginning, and whenever it encounters a pair of elements that are not in non-decreasing order, it checks if the digits of the previous element can be rearranged to make the pair non-decreasing. If it is not possible to rearrange the digits, the program sets the answer to False and breaks the loop. Finally, it prints 'YES' if the answer is True and 'NO' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
