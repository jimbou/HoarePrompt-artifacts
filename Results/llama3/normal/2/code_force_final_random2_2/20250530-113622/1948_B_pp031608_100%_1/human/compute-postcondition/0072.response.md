Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer that must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[0]` as integers and `arr[1]`, and `ans` is True if `nums` is sorted in ascending order and `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, otherwise False. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[-1]` is equal to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[-1]` as integers and `arr[0]`, and `ans` is False if `nums` is not sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, `ans` is True if `nums` is sorted in ascending order and `arr[0]` is not less than `arr[-1]`.***
