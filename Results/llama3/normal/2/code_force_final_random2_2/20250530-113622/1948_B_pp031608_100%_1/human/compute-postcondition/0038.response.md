Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, m is at least 2, arr is a list of n integers, i is m - 2, ans is False, nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of arr[i - 1] and the last element is arr[i].**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`, which was previously unchanged. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop or the closest enclosing loop, but since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, it does not affect the state of any variables.

Therefore, the only change in the output state is that `ans` is now `False`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
