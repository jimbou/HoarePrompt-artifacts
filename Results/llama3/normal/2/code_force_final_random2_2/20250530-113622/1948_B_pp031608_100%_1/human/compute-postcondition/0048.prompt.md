Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, ans is True
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is `m - 1`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is set to the first element of `nums` where `nums` is a list of integers with the first elements being the digits of the old value of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element being `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, the state of `ans` remains unchanged. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, then the state of `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is `m - 2`, and `ans` is unchanged. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then the value at index `i - 1` in `arr` is the first digit of the original value at index `i - 1`, and if the list of integers `nums`, where the first elements are the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`, is not sorted, then `ans` is `False`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is updated to its first digit, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
