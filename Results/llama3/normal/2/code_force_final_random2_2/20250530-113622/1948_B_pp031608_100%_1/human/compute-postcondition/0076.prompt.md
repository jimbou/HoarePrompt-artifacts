Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i <= 99).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    m = int(input())
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    ans = True
    for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
        if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
            nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
            if nums != sorted(nums):
                ans = False
                break
            arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
    print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 inclusive where the first element is the first digit of the original first element of `arr` if the second element of `arr` is less than the first element, otherwise the state of `arr` remains unchanged, `ans` is False if there exists an `i` such that `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i-1]` and the list of digits of `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]` is not sorted, otherwise `ans` is True, and either 'NO' or 'YES' is printed depending on the value of `ans`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, i is 1, ans is True or False. If arr[i] is less than arr[i - 1] for any i from m - 1 to 1, then arr[i - 1] is set to the first element of nums where nums is a list of integers with the first elements being the digits of the old value of arr[i - 1] and the last element being arr[i]. If nums is not sorted in ascending order for any i from m - 1 to 1, then ans is False. Otherwise, the state of ans remains unchanged, and either 'NO' or 'YES' is printed depending on the value of ans.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer that must be at least 1, arr is a list of n integers where arr[0] is equal to nums[0], i is 0, and ans is True if nums is sorted in ascending order and arr[i] is not less than arr[i - 1], otherwise False. If arr[i] is less than arr[i - 1], then arr[-1] is equal to nums[0], nums is a list containing the digits of arr[-1] as integers and arr[0], and ans is False if nums is not sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, ans is True if nums is sorted in ascending order and arr[0] is not less than arr[-1]., and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
