The code `n = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i <= 99). 

Since `n` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, `n` is now an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive. The stdin now contains the remaining test cases, which is `t-1` test cases. Each test case still consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i <= 99).

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i <= 99).**
