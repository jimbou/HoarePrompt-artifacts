The code prints 'YES' if the list `arr` is sorted in ascending order or if the list `nums` is sorted in ascending order and the first element of `arr` is not less than the last element of `arr`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. Where `arr` is a list of n integers where arr[0] is equal to nums[0], and nums is a list containing the digits of arr[-1] as integers and arr[0].
Output: **n is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer that must be at least 1, arr is a list of n integers where arr[0] is equal to nums[0], i is 0, and ans is True if nums is sorted in ascending order and arr[i] is not less than arr[i - 1], otherwise False. If arr[i] is less than arr[i - 1], then arr[-1] is equal to nums[0], nums is a list containing the digits of arr[-1] as integers and arr[0], and ans is False if nums is not sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, ans is True if nums is sorted in ascending order and arr[0] is not less than arr[-1]., and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed**
