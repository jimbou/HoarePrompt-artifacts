To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `n` in the loop head. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0.


State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i <= 99), `_` is 0**
