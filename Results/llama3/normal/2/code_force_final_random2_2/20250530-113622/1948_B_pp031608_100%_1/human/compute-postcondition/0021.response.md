Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 inclusive where the first element is the first digit of the original first element of `arr`, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the original first element of `arr` and the last element is the first digit of the original first element of `arr`, if `nums` is not sorted then `ans` is False.**

In this output state, the value of `arr[i - 1]` has been updated to `nums[0]`, which is the first digit of the original first element of `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `nums` has also been updated, as its last element is now the first digit of the original first element of `arr`.
