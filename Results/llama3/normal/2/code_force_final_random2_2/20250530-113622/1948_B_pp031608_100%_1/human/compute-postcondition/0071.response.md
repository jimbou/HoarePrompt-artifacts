Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer that must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where `arr[-1]` is equal to `nums[0]`, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[-1]` as integers and `arr[0]`, and `ans` is False if `nums` is not sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, `ans` is True if `nums` is sorted in ascending order and `arr[0]` is not less than `arr[-1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `arr[i - 1]` has been updated to `nums[0]`. Since `i` is 0, `arr[i - 1]` is equivalent to `arr[-1]`. Therefore, `arr[-1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
