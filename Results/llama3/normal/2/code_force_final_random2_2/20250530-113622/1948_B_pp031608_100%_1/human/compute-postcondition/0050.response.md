Output: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, i is 1, ans is True or False. If arr[i] is less than arr[i - 1] for any i from m - 1 to 1, then arr[i - 1] is set to the first element of nums where nums is a list of integers with the first elements being the digits of the old value of arr[i - 1] and the last element being arr[i]. If nums is not sorted in ascending order for any i from m - 1 to 1, then ans is False. Otherwise, the state of ans remains unchanged, and either 'NO' or 'YES' is printed depending on the value of ans.**
