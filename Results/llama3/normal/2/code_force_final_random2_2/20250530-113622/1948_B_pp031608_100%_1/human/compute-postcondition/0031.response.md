Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `ans` is True, `i` is `m - 1`, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, and `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`. The current value of `nums` is not sorted in ascending order.***
