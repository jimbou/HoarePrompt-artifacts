This function reads input from the standard input, processes it, and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' to the standard output. It accepts a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by n integers. The function checks if the integers in each test case can be rearranged in ascending order by only rearranging the digits of the first integer. If the integers can be rearranged in ascending order, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
