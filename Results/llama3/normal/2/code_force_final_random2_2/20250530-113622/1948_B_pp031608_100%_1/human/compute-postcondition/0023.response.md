Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 inclusive where the first element is the first digit of the original first element of `arr` if the second element of `arr` is less than the first element, otherwise the state of `arr` remains unchanged, `ans` is False if there exists an `i` such that `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i-1]` and the list of digits of `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]` is not sorted, otherwise `ans` is True.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `m` will be 1, and the value of `n` will remain unchanged. The list `arr` will be modified only if there exists an `i` such that `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i-1]`, in which case the first element of `arr` will be replaced by the first digit of the original first element of `arr`. The variable `ans` will be False if there exists an `i` such that `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i-1]` and the list of digits of `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]` is not sorted, otherwise `ans` will be True.
