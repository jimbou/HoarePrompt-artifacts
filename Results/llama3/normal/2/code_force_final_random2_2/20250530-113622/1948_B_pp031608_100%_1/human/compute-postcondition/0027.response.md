Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, ans is True**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `m`. The second line assigns a list of `n` integers from the input to `arr`. The third line sets `ans` to `True`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `ans` is set to `True` regardless of its previous value. The state of `arr` is updated to reflect the new list of integers.
