Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer that must be at least 1, arr is a list of n integers where arr[0] is equal to nums[0], i is 0, and ans is True if nums is sorted in ascending order and arr[i] is not less than arr[i - 1], otherwise False. If arr[i] is less than arr[i - 1], then arr[-1] is equal to nums[0], nums is a list containing the digits of arr[-1] as integers and arr[0], and ans is False if nums is not sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, ans is True if nums is sorted in ascending order and arr[0] is not less than arr[-1].**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will continue to execute until `i` reaches 0. At this point, the value of `m` will be at least 1, and the list `arr` will have its first element (`arr[0]`) equal to the first element of the sorted list `nums`. The variable `ans` will be True if the list `nums` is sorted in ascending order and the current element `arr[i]` is not less than the previous element `arr[i - 1]`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then the last element of `arr` (`arr[-1]`) will be equal to the first element of `nums`, and `nums` will contain the digits of `arr[-1]` as integers and `arr[0]`. In this case, `ans` will be False if `nums` is not sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, `ans` will be True if `nums` is sorted in ascending order and `arr[0]` is not less than `arr[-1]`.
