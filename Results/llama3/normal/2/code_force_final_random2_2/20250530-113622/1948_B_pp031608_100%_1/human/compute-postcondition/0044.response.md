Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, m is at least 2, arr is a list of n integers, i is m - 3, ans is False, and nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of arr[i - 1] and the last element is arr[i].**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`, changing its state from "unchanged" to `False`. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop or the execution of the code block. However, since there is no loop or conditional statement provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the `break` statement does not affect the state of any variables.

Therefore, the final output state includes all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution, with the only modification being the value of `ans`, which is now `False`.
