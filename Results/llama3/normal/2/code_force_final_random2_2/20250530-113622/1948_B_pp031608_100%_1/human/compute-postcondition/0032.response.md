Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, m is at least 2, arr is a list of n integers, ans is False, i is m - 1, arr[i] is less than arr[i - 1], and nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of arr[i - 1] and the last element is arr[i].**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`, which was initially `True`. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables or their values.

Therefore, the only change in the output state is the value of `ans`, which is now `False`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is `m - 1`, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, and `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`.
