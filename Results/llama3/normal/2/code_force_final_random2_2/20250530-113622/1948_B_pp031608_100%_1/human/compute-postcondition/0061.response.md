To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than 0, and `i` will decrement by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than 0. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `i` to be 1.

The other variables in the loop head are `m`, but its value does not affect the loop execution directly. However, since `m` is an integer that must be at least 3, we can keep its state unchanged.

The other variables `n`, `arr`, and `ans` are not part of the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer that must be at least 3, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is 1, and `ans` is True.**
