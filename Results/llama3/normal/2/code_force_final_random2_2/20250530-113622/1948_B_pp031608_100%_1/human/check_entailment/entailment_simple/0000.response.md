Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order using the given operation.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program iterates over the array from the end to the beginning (i.e., from `m-1` to `0`).
2. For each pair of adjacent elements `arr[i]` and `arr[i-1]`, it checks if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i-1]`. If this condition is true, it means that the array is not sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. If the condition is true, the program splits the larger element `arr[i-1]` into its digits and combines them with `arr[i]` to form a new list `nums`.
4. The program then checks if `nums` is sorted in ascending order. If it's not, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
5. If `nums` is sorted, the program updates `arr[i-1]` to be the first element of `nums` (i.e., the first digit of the original `arr[i-1]`).
6. After iterating over the entire array, the program prints "YES" if `ans` is still `True`, indicating that the array can be made sorted in non-decreasing order using the given operation. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the array is already sorted or when the operation is not needed.

Correctness: **True**
