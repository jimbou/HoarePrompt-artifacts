Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `i - 1` is the first digit of the original value at index `i - 1`, `i` is `m - 2`, and if the list of integers `nums`, where the first elements are the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`, is not sorted, then `ans` is `False`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `arr` at index `i - 1` has been updated to be the first digit of its original value. All other variables remain unchanged, and the condition for `ans` being `False` still applies if the list of integers `nums` is not sorted.
