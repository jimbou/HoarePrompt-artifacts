Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer that must be at least 3, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is 2, `ans` is True, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `nums` is a combination of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the value of `arr[i]`. The digits of `arr[i - 1]` are converted to integers and added to the list, followed by the value of `arr[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
