To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head according to the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than 0, and `i` will decrease by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to decrease `i` by 1.

The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `i`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `arr`, `nums`, and `ans`) are not affected by the loop statement.

Here is the updated state:

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 inclusive. If the second element of `arr` is less than the first element, the second element of `arr` is replaced by the first digit of `arr[1]`, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[1]` and the last element is `arr[2]`. If `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, no specific changes are made to the variables.**
