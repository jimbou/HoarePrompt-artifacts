Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 inclusive. If the value at index `i` is less than the value at index `i-1`, then `ans` is False if the list of digits of `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]` is not sorted. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
