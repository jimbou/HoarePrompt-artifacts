Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 inclusive, `i` is 2, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[1]` and the last element is `arr[2]`.**

In this output state, the value of `nums` is a combination of the digits of `arr[1]` and `arr[2]`. The digits of `arr[1]` are extracted by converting `arr[1]` to a string and then using a list comprehension to convert each character back to an integer. The last element of `nums` is simply `arr[2]`. The values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged.
