Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer that must be at least 3, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where `arr[0]` is equal to `nums[0]`, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[0]` as integers and `arr[1]`, and `ans` is True if `nums` is sorted in ascending order, otherwise False.**

In this output state, the value of `arr[0]` has been updated to be equal to `nums[0]`, which is the first element of the list `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` still contains `n` integers, and the list `nums` still contains the digits of `arr[0]` as integers and `arr[1]`. The value of `ans` is still dependent on whether `nums` is sorted in ascending order or not.
