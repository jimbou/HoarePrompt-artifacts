Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer that must be at least 3, arr is a list of n integers, i is 2, and ans is True. If arr[i] is less than arr[i - 1], then ans is False if the list of integers formed by the digits of arr[i - 1] and arr[i] is not sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, the state of ans remains unchanged.***
