Based on the initial state, the code will print either 'NO' or 'YES' depending on the value of `ans`.

The value of `ans` is determined by the condition: if there exists an `i` such that `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i-1]` and the list of digits of `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]` is not sorted, then `ans` is False, otherwise `ans` is True.

Since the exact values of `arr` are not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either 'NO' or 'YES' depending on whether the condition is met.

Output: **'NO' if there exists an i such that arr[i] is less than arr[i-1] and the list of digits of arr[i-1] and arr[i] is not sorted, otherwise 'YES'**
