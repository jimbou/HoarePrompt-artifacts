Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, i is 2, ans is True
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, m is an integer that must be at least 3, arr is a list of n integers, i is 2, and ans is True. If arr[i] is less than arr[i - 1], then ans is False if the list of integers formed by the digits of arr[i - 1] and arr[i] is not sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, the state of ans remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer that must be at least 3, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where `arr[0]` is equal to `nums[0]`, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[0]` as integers and `arr[1]`, and `ans` is True if `nums` is sorted in ascending order and `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, otherwise False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `m` is an integer that must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[0]` as integers and `arr[1]`, and `ans` is True if `nums` is sorted in ascending order and `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, otherwise False. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[-1]` is equal to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[-1]` as integers and `arr[0]`, and `ans` is False if `nums` is not sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, `ans` is True if `nums` is sorted in ascending order and `arr[0]` is not less than `arr[-1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
