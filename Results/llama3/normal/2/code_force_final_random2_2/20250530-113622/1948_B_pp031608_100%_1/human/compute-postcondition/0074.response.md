The code prints 'YES' if the list `arr` is sorted in ascending order and the current element `arr[i]` is not less than the previous element `arr[i - 1]`, or if the list `nums` is sorted in ascending order and the first element `arr[0]` is not less than the last element `arr[-1]`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Since the exact values of `arr`, `nums`, and `i` are not provided, we can't determine the exact output. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the conditions described above.

Output: **'YES' if the conditions are met, otherwise 'NO'**
