Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `freq` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is each unique integer in `arr` and the value is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, `n` is the last integer in `arr`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `arr` list remains unchanged, the `freq` dictionary contains the frequency of each unique integer in the `arr` list, and the variable `n` holds the value of the last integer in the `arr` list.
