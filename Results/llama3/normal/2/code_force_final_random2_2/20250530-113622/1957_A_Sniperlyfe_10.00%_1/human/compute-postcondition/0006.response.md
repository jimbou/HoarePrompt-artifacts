The code `freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1` updates the value of `freq[n]` by incrementing it by 1. Since `n` is the third integer in `arr`, `freq[n]` is initially not present in the dictionary `freq`. Therefore, `freq.get(n, 0)` returns 0, and `freq[n]` is assigned the value 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `freq` is a dictionary with three key-value pairs where the key is the first integer in `arr` and the value is 1, the key is the second integer in `arr` and the value is 2, and the key is the third integer in `arr` and the value is 1, `n` is the third integer in `arr`.**
