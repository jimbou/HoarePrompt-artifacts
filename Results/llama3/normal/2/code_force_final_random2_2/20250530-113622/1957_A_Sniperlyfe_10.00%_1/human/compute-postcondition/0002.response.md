The code `freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1` updates the frequency of the integer `n` in the dictionary `freq`. Since `n` is the first integer in the list `arr`, the frequency of `n` is incremented by 1. The value of `freq[n]` is now 1, because `freq` was initially an empty dictionary and `get(n, 0)` returns 0 if `n` is not in the dictionary.

The values of the other variables are not affected. `arr` is still a list of integers with at least 1 integer, and `n` is still the first integer in the list.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `freq` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first integer in `arr` and the value is 1, `n` is the first integer in `arr`.**
