The only variables in the loop head are variable `n` and list `arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 integer, `freq` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first integer in `arr` and the value is 1, `n` is the first integer in `arr`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the `n` is the second integer in the list.
State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `freq` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first integer in `arr` and the value is 1, `n` is the second integer in `arr`.**
