#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, where each integer represents the length of a stick, and all integers are between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers, `freq` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is each unique integer in `arr` and the value is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, `n` is the last integer in `arr`.
    return sum(v // 4 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer divisions of the frequency of each unique integer in the list `arr` by 4.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers representing stick lengths and returns the total number of sets of four sticks that can be formed from the given sticks, where each set consists of sticks of the same length.
