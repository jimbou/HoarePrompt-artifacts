Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, where each integer represents the length of a stick, and all integers are between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `freq` is an empty dictionary**.

In this output state, the list `arr` remains unchanged, still containing integers representing the lengths of sticks, all within the range of 1 to 100. The variable `freq` has been introduced and is assigned an empty dictionary. This dictionary is initially empty, awaiting potential future assignments or updates, likely intended to store frequency counts of stick lengths.
