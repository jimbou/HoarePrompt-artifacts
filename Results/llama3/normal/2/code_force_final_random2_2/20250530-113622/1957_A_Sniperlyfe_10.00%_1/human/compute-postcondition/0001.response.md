According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `freq` is an empty dictionary. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the variable `n` is the first integer in the list.
State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `n` is the first integer in the list**
