Output State: **The program returns the sum of the integer divisions of the frequency of each unique integer in the list `arr` by 4.**

In this output state, the frequency of each unique integer in `arr` is obtained from the dictionary `freq`, where each key is a unique integer in `arr` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in `arr`. The integer division of each frequency by 4 is calculated using the expression `v // 4`, and the results are summed up using the `sum` function. The final result is the sum of these integer divisions, which represents the total count of the frequencies of the unique integers in `arr` divided by 4.
