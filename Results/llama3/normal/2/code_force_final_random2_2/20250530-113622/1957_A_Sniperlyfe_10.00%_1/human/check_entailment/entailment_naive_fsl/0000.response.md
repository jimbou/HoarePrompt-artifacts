Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the fact that it only considers the maximum number of polygons that can be formed with 4 sides (i.e., squares), but it does not consider the possibility of forming polygons with other numbers of sides (e.g., triangles, pentagons, hexagons, etc.).

For example, if the input is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], the program will output 0, but the correct output should be 1, because we can form a hexagon with 6 sides.

The program should be modified to consider all possible numbers of sides, not just 4.
