Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `freq` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the key is the first integer in `arr` and the value is 1, and the key is the second integer in `arr` and the value is 2, `n` is the second integer in `arr`.**

In this output state, the dictionary `freq` now has two key-value pairs. The first key-value pair remains the same, where the key is the first integer in `arr` and the value is 1. The second key-value pair is updated, where the key is the second integer in `arr` (which is `n`) and the value is 2. This is because the code increments the value of `freq[n]` by 1, and since `n` is the second integer in `arr`, its frequency is now 2. The values of `arr` and `n` remain unchanged.
