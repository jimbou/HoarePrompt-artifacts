Output State: **`index` is 7, `n` is an integer equal to the value at `data[5]`, `s` is a string equal to the value at `data[5]`, `num_up_coins` is an integer equal to the number of 'U' characters in the value at `data[5]`, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `results` is a list containing 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the value at `data[4]` is odd, otherwise 'NO', followed by 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the value at `data[4]` is odd, otherwise 'NO', and 'YES', `_` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `data` is a list of strings containing the input data.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `index` remains 7, `n` and `s` are still equal to the value at `data[5]`, `num_up_coins` is still the number of 'U' characters in the value at `data[5]`, `t` is still greater than 2, `_` is still 2, and `stdin` is still empty. The list `results` now contains three elements: the first two elements are 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the value at `data[4]` is odd, otherwise 'NO', and the third element is 'YES'. The list `data` remains unchanged.
