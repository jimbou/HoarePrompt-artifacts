Output State: **index is 5, n is an integer equal to the value at data[3], s is a string equal to the value at data[4], num_up_coins is an integer equal to the number of 'U' characters in the value at data[4], t is an integer greater than 1, results is a list containing 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the value at data[4] is odd, otherwise 'NO', followed by 'NO', _ is 1, stdin is empty, data is a list of strings containing the input data.**

In natural language, the output state is: The index remains 5, the value of n is still equal to the value at data[3], the string s is still equal to the value at data[4], the number of 'U' characters in the value at data[4] is still stored in num_up_coins, t is still greater than 1, the results list now contains an additional 'NO' at the end, _ is still 1, the standard input is still empty, and the data list remains unchanged.
