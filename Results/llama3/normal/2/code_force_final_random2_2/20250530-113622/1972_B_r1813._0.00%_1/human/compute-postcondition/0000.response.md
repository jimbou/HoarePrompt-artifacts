Output State: **stdin is empty, data is a list of strings containing the input data, index is 1, t is an integer representing the number of test cases, results is an empty list**.

The code reads the entire input from stdin and splits it into a list of strings, which is stored in the variable `data`. The `index` variable is initialized to 0 and then incremented to 1, indicating that the first element of `data` has been processed. The first element of `data` is converted to an integer and stored in the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The `results` list is initialized as an empty list. Stdin is now empty since the entire input has been read.
