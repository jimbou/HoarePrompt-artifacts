Output State: **`index` is 5, `n` is an integer equal to the value at `data[3]`, `s` is a string equal to the value at `data[4]`, `num_up_coins` is an integer equal to the number of 'U' characters in the value at `data[4]`, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `results` is a list containing 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the value at `data[4]` is odd, otherwise 'NO', and an additional 'YES', `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `data` is a list of strings containing the input data.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `index` is still 5, `n` is still equal to the value at index 3 of the `data` list, `s` is still equal to the value at index 4 of the `data` list, `num_up_coins` is still equal to the number of 'U' characters in the value at index 4 of the `data` list, `t` is still greater than 1, `results` is a list that contains 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the value at index 4 of the `data` list is odd, otherwise 'NO', and an additional 'YES' has been appended to it, `_` is still 1, `stdin` is still empty, and `data` is still a list of strings containing the input data.
