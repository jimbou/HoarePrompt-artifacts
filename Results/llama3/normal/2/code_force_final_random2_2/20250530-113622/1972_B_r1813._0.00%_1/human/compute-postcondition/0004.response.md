Output State: **`index` is 3, `n` is an integer equal to the value at `data[1]`, `s` is a string equal to the value at `data[2]`, `num_up_coins` is an odd integer equal to the number of 'U' characters in `s`, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the string 'YES', `_` is 0, `data` is a list of strings containing the input data, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `index`, `n`, `s`, `num_up_coins`, `t`, and `_` remain unchanged. The `results` list now contains the string 'YES'. The `data` list and stdin remain unchanged.
