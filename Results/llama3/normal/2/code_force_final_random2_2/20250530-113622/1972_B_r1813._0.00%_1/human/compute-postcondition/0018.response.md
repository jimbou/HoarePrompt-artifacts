Output State: **index is t*2+1, n is an integer equal to the value at data[t*2], s is a string equal to the value at data[t*2+1], num_up_coins is an integer equal to the number of 'U' characters in the value at data[t*2+1], t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, results is a list containing 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the value at data[2*i+1] is odd, otherwise 'NO', for i from 0 to t-1, _ is t-1, stdin is empty, data is a list of strings containing the input data.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the index will be at the position in the data list that is two times the number of test cases plus one. The variable n will hold the value of the last test case, s will hold the string of the last test case, and num_up_coins will hold the number of 'U' characters in the last test case string. The variable t will be the same as the initial number of test cases, and the results list will contain 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case depending on whether the number of 'U' characters in the corresponding string is odd or even. The variable _ will be one less than the number of test cases, and the stdin and data variables will remain unchanged.
