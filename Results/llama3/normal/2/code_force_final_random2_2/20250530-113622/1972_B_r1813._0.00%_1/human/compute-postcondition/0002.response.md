Output State: **index is 3, n is an integer equal to the value at data[1], s is a string equal to the value at data[2], num_up_coins is an integer equal to the number of 'U' characters in s, t is an integer greater than 0, results is an empty list, _ is 0, stdin is empty, data is a list of strings containing the input data**

In this output state, the value of `index` has been incremented twice, so it is now 3. The value of `n` is an integer equal to the value at `data[1]`. The value of `s` is a string equal to the value at `data[2]`. The value of `num_up_coins` is an integer equal to the number of 'U' characters in `s`. The values of `t`, `results`, `_`, `stdin`, and `data` remain unchanged.
