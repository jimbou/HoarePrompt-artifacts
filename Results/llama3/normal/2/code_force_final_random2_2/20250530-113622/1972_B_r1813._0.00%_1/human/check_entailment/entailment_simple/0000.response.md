Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly reads the input data, processes each test case, and prints the results. The logic for determining who will win the game is also correct. If the number of 'U' characters in the string is odd, Alice will win the game, and if it's even, Bob will win. This is because the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will win.

The program uses a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem. It counts the number of 'U' characters in the string and checks if it's odd or even. If it's odd, it appends 'YES' to the results list, indicating that Alice will win. If it's even, it appends 'NO' to the results list, indicating that Bob will win.

The program also handles the input and output correctly. It reads the input data from stdin, processes each test case, and prints the results.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
