#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of coins, 1 <= n <= 100) and then a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        s = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: index is t*2+1, n is an integer equal to the value at data[t*2], s is a string equal to the value at data[t*2+1], num_up_coins is an integer equal to the number of 'U' characters in the value at data[t*2+1], t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, results is a list containing 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the value at data[2*i+1] is odd, otherwise 'NO', for i from 0 to t-1, _ is t-1, stdin is empty, data is a list of strings containing the input data.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `index` is t*2+1, `n` is an integer equal to the value at `data[t*2]`, `s` is a string equal to the value at `data[t*2+1]`, `num_up_coins` is an integer equal to the number of 'U' characters in the value at `data[t*2+1]`, `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `results` is a list containing 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the value at `data[2*i+1]` is odd, otherwise 'NO', for `i` from 0 to `t-1`, `result` is the last element in the list, `_` is `t-1`, `stdin` is empty, `data` is a list of strings containing the input data, and the last element in the list results which is 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the value at `data[2*i+1]` is odd, otherwise 'NO' is printed

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer (the number of coins) and a string of 'U' and 'D' characters. It then determines whether the number of 'U' characters in each string is odd or even and prints 'YES' if it's odd and 'NO' if it's even. The function processes all test cases and prints the results in the order they were received.
