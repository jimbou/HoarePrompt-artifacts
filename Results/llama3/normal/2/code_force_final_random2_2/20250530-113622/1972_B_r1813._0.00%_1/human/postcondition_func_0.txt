This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer (the number of coins) and a string of 'U' and 'D' characters. It then determines whether the number of 'U' characters in each string is odd or even and prints 'YES' if it's odd and 'NO' if it's even. The function processes all test cases and prints the results in the order they were received.
