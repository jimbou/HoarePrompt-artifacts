Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: index is t*2+1, n is an integer equal to the value at data[t*2], s is a string equal to the value at data[t*2+1], num_up_coins is an integer equal to the number of 'U' characters in the value at data[t*2+1], t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, results is a list containing 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the value at data[2*i+1] is odd, otherwise 'NO', for i from 0 to t-1, _ is t-1, stdin is empty, data is a list of strings containing the input data.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `index` is t*2+1, `n` is an integer equal to the value at `data[t*2]`, `s` is a string equal to the value at `data[t*2+1]`, `num_up_coins` is an integer equal to the number of 'U' characters in the value at `data[t*2+1]`, `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `results` is a list containing 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the value at `data[2*i+1]` is odd, otherwise 'NO', for `i` from 0 to `t-1`, that must have at least 1 element, `result` is the first element in the list, `_` is `t-1`, `stdin` is empty, `data` is a list of strings containing the input data, and the first element of the list `results` which is `result` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `index` is t*2+1, `n` is an integer equal to the value at `data[t*2]`, `s` is a string equal to the value at `data[t*2+1]`, `num_up_coins` is an integer equal to the number of 'U' characters in the value at `data[t*2+1]`, `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `results` is a list containing 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the value at `data[2*i+1]` is odd, otherwise 'NO', for `i` from 0 to `t-1`, that must have at least 2 elements, `result` is the second element in the list, `_` is `t-1`, `stdin` is empty, `data` is a list of strings containing the input data, and the second element in the list results is printed which is 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the value at `data[2*i+1]` is odd, otherwise 'NO'

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `index` is t*2+1, `n` is an integer equal to the value at `data[t*2]`, `s` is a string equal to the value at `data[t*2+1]`, `num_up_coins` is an integer equal to the number of 'U' characters in the value at `data[t*2+1]`, `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `results` is a list containing 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the value at `data[2*i+1]` is odd, otherwise 'NO', for `i` from 0 to `t-1`, that must have at least 3 elements, `result` is the third element in the list, `_` is `t-1`, `stdin` is empty, `data` is a list of strings containing the input data, and the third element in the list results which is 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the value at `data[2*i+1]` is odd, otherwise 'NO' is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
