Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is 0, `i` is 5, `m` is an integer and is not equal to 0 and is greater than or equal to 5, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, dp is a list of length m + 1 with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, dp[3] equal to (dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10**9 + 7), dp[4] equal to (dp[3] + (4 - 1) * dp[2] * 2) % (10**9 + 7), dp[5] equal to (dp[4] + (5 - 1) * dp[3] * 2) % (10**9 + 7)**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` remains an integer, `k` remains 0, `i` remains 5, `m` remains an integer and is not equal to 0 and is greater than or equal to 5, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1. The list `dp` has been updated with new values for `dp[4]` and `dp[5]`, which are calculated based on the previous values of `dp[3]`, `dp[2]`, and `dp[1]`. The values of `dp[1]`, `dp[2]`, and `dp[3]` remain the same.
