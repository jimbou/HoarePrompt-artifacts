Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is currently greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is equal to k and is 4, `m` is an integer equal to n minus k or n minus 2*k, is not equal to 0 or 1, and is at least 4, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is either k or 2*k, `dp` is a list of m+1 elements where dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, dp[3] is (dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10**9 + 7), dp[4] is (dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % (10**9 + 7).**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains a positive integer, `n` remains an integer, `i` remains equal to `k` and is 4, `m` remains an integer equal to `n` minus `k` or `n` minus 2 times `k`, and is at least 4, `c` and `r` remain integers, `num` remains either `k` or 2 times `k`. The list `dp` has been updated with a new value at index 4, which is calculated based on the previous values in the list.
