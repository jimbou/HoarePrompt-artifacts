Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is currently greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is either 3 or 4 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `num` is either 4 or 5, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `k` - 3**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains a positive integer, still 3 less than its original value and greater than 0. `n`, `i`, `k`, `m`, `c`, and `r` retain their original values. `num` has been incremented by 1, so if `c` equals `r`, `num` is now either 3 or 4; otherwise, it's either 4 or 5. The number of test cases in stdin has not changed.
