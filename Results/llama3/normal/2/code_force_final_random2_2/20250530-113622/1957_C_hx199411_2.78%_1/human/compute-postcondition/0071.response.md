Output State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and t currently must be greater than 0, n is an integer, i is equal to k, c and r are integers, m is an integer and not equal to 0 and also not equal to 1, num is either equal to k or greater than k, stdin contains multiple test cases minus k-1, dp is a list of m+1 integers where dp[1] is 1 and dp[2] is 3 and all other elements are 0**

In this output state, the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `i`, `c`, `r`, `m`, `num`, and `stdin` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the provided code snippet. The code snippet only introduces a new variable `dp`, which is a list of `m+1` integers, where the first two elements (`dp[1]` and `dp[2]`) are set to 1 and 3, respectively, and all other elements are initialized to 0.
