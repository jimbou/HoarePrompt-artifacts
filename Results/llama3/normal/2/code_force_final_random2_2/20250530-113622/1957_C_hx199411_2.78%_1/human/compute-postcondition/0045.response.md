Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num` is 0, `c` and `r` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `num` remain unchanged. The code assigns the values of `c` and `r` from the input, which is a space-separated list of integers. Since `stdin` initially contained multiple test cases minus 2, after reading one test case, it now contains multiple test cases minus 3.
