Output State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and t currently must be greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, num is 0**

Explanation:
The first line decrements `t` by 1, making it 1 less than its original value. The second line reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. The third line initializes `num` to 0. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1.
