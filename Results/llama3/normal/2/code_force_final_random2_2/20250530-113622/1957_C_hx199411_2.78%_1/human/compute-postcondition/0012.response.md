Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is 2 if `c` and `r` are equal, otherwise `num` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been incremented by 1. If `c` and `r` are equal, `num` was originally 1, so it is now 2. If `c` and `r` are not equal, `num` was originally 2, so it is now 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
