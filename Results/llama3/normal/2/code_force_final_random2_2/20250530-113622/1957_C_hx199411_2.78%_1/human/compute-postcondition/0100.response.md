Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is currently greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is either 4 or 5 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `num` is either 5 or 6, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `k` - 3**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been incremented by 2. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is now either 4 or 5, otherwise it is either 5 or 6. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus `k` - 3.
