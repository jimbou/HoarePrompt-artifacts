Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to arrange the rooks on the board, taking into account the mirroring of moves by the computer. The program also correctly handles the cases where m is 0 or 1, and prints the result modulo 10^9 + 7 to avoid overflow.

Correctness: **True**
