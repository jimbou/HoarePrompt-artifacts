Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If `c` and `r` are equal, `num` is 2. If `c` and `r` are not equal, `num` is 4.***
