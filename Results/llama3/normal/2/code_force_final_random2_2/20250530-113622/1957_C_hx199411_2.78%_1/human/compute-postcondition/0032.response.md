Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is 0, `i` is 3, `m` is an integer and is not equal to 0 and is greater than or equal to 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, dp is a list of length m + 1 with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, dp[3] equal to (dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7) and dp[0] is 0**

In this output state, the value of `dp[3]` has been updated based on the given formula, using the values of `dp[2]` and `dp[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1.
