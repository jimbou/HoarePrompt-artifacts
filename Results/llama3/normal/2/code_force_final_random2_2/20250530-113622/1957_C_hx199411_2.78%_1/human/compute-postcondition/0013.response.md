Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is 3 if `c` and `r` are equal, otherwise `num` is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to be 3 if `c` and `r` are equal, and 4 otherwise, by adding 2 to its original value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
