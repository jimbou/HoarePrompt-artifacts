Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 times the number of iterations of the loop and is currently greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is equal to `m`, `m` is an integer equal to `n` minus `k` or `n` minus 2 times `k`, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is either `k` or 2 times `k`, stdin contains no more test cases. If `m` is 0, the value 0 is being printed. If `m` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. Otherwise, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for all `i` from 3 to `m`, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10**9 + 7)***
