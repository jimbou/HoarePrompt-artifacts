The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be at least 4.
State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is currently greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is equal to k and is 4, `m` is an integer equal to n minus k or n minus 2*k, is not equal to 0 or 1, and is at least 4, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is either k or 2*k, `dp` is a list of m+1 elements where dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, dp[3] is (dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10**9 + 7), dp[4] is (dp[3] + 2 * dp[2] * 3) % (10**9 + 7)**
