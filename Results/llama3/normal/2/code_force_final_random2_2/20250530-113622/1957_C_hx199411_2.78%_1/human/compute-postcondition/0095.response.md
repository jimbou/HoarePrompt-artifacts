Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is currently greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is either 3 or 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `k` - 2.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to either 3 or 4, depending on whether `c` is equal to `r` or not. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus `k` - 2.
