Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four. If `c` and `r` are equal, `num` is 4. If `c` and `r` are not equal, `num` is 6.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated based on its previous value. If `c` and `r` were equal, `num` was 2, and now it is 4. If `c` and `r` were not equal, `num` was 4, and now it is 6. The other variables remain unchanged.
