Output State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, k is 0, i is 0, m is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1. If c and r are equal, m is equal to n minus the number of times c and r are equal minus the number of times c and r are not equal. If c and r are not equal, m is equal to n minus twice the number of times c and r are not equal.**

In this output state, the value of `m` is calculated based on the values of `n` and `num`. Since `num` is equal to the number of times `c` and `r` are equal plus the number of times `c` and `r` are not equal if `c` and `r` are equal, and twice the number of times `c` and `r` are not equal if `c` and `r` are not equal, the value of `m` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.
