Output State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, num is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, and `n` and `k` have been assigned the values of the first two integers from the input. The variable `num` has been initialized to 0. The state of `stdin` has been updated to reflect that one test case has been processed.
