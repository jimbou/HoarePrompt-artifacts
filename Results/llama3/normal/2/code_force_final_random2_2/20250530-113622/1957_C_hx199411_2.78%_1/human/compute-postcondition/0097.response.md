To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `k` remains the same.

The other variables in the state, `t`, `n`, `m`, `c`, `r`, and `num`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is currently greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is either 2 or 3 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `num` is either 3 or 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `k` - 2**
