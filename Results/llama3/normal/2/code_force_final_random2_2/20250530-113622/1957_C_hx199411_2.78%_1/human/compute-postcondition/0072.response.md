To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is greater than or equal to 3, since the range starts from 3. 

State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is 3, `c` and `r` are integers, `m` is an integer and not equal to 0 and also not equal to 1 and `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `num` is either equal to `k` or greater than `k`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k-1`, `dp` is a list of `m+1` integers where `dp[1]` is 1 and `dp[2]` is 3 and all other elements are 0**
