This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer n and an integer k, followed by k lines with two integers each. It calculates the number of ways to arrange the integers in a specific pattern, based on the values of n and k. If the calculated value m is 0, it prints 0. If m is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to arrange the integers and prints the result modulo 10^9 + 7. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input.
