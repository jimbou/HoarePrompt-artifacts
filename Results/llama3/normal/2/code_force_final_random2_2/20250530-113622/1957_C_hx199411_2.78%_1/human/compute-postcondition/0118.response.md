Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is currently greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is 5, `m` is an integer equal to n minus 5 or n minus 10, is not equal to 0 or 1, and is at least 5, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is either 5 or 10, `dp` is a list of m+1 elements where dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, dp[3] is (dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10**9 + 7), dp[4] is (dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % (10**9 + 7), dp[5] is (dp[4] + 4 * dp[3] * 2) % (10**9 + 7).**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `c`, `r`, and `num` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `i` is still 5. The value of `m` is still an integer equal to `n` minus 5 or `n` minus 10, and it is not equal to 0 or 1, and is at least 5. The list `dp` has been updated with new values for `dp[4]` and `dp[5]`, which are calculated based on the previous values of `dp[3]`, `dp[2]`, and `dp[1]`.
