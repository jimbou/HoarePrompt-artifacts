Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 4. If `c` and `r` are equal, `num` is 2. Otherwise, `num` is 3.***
