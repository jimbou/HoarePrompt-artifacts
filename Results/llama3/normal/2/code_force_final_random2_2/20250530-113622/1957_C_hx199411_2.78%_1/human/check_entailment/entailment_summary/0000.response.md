Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to arrange the integers in a specific pattern, based on the values of n and k. The program also correctly handles the cases where m is 0 or 1, and prints the result modulo 10^9 + 7.

The program's logic is sound and it correctly implements the required functionality. The use of dynamic programming is appropriate for this problem, as it allows the program to efficiently calculate the number of ways to arrange the integers. The program also correctly handles the modulo operation to prevent overflow.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
