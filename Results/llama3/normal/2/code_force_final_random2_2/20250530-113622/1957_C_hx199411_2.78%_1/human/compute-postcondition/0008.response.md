Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `num` is 2, `c` and `r` are integers and `c` is not equal to `r`, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to 2, which is the result of adding 2 to its initial value of 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
