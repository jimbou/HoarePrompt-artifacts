Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains an integer n and an integer k on the first line, followed by k lines, each containing two integers r_i and c_i. 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    num = 0
    for i in range(k):
        c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if c == r:
            num += 1
        else:
            num += 2
    m = n - num
    if m == 0:
        print(0)
    elif m == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
        dp[1] = 1
        dp[2] = 3
        for i in range(3, m + 1):
            dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
        print(dp[m])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, k is 0, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1. If c and r are equal, m is equal to n minus the number of times c and r are equal minus the number of times c and r are not equal. If c and r are not equal, m is equal to n minus twice the number of times c and r are not equal. If m is 0, 0 is printed. If m is 1, the number 1 is printed. If m is greater than 1, i is set to m, and dp is a list of length m + 1 with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and dp[i] equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is equal to `k` if `m` is 0 or 1, otherwise `i` is equal to `m`, `c` and `r` are integers, `m` is an integer, `num` is either equal to `k` or greater than `k`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `k`-1. If `m` is 0, the value 0 is being printed. If `m` is 1, the number 1 is printed. If `m` is not 0 or 1, a list `dp` of `m+1` integers is created where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for all `i` from 3 to `m`, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 times the number of iterations of the loop and is currently greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is equal to `m`, `m` is an integer equal to `n` minus `k` or `n` minus 2 times `k`, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is either `k` or 2 times `k`, stdin contains no more test cases. If `m` is 0, the value 0 is being printed. If `m` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. Otherwise, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for all `i` from 3 to `m`, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
