Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is equal to `k`, `c` and `r` are integers, `num` is either equal to `k` or greater than `k`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `k`-1. The current value of `m` is 1***
