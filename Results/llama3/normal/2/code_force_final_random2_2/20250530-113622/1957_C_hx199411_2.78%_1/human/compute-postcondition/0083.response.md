The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and t currently must be greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `i` is equal to `k` if `m` is 0 or 1, otherwise `i` is equal to `m`, `c` and `r` are integers, `m` is an integer, `num` is either equal to `k` or greater than `k`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `k`-1. If `m` is 0, the value 0 is being printed. If `m` is 1, the number 1 is printed. If `m` is not 0 or 1, a list `dp` of `m+1` integers is created where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for all `i` from 3 to `m`, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10**9 + 7)**
