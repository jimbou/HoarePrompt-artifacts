Output State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, k is 0, i is k, stdin contains multiple test cases minus k. If c and r are equal, num is equal to the number of times c and r are equal plus the number of times c and r are not equal. If c and r are not equal, num is equal to twice the number of times c and r are not equal.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the values of the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The value of `t` remains unchanged, `n` is still an integer, and `k` is now 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The value of `i` is equal to `k`, which is 0, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k`, which means that all the test cases have been processed. The value of `num` depends on the number of times `c` and `r` are equal or not equal, and is calculated accordingly.
