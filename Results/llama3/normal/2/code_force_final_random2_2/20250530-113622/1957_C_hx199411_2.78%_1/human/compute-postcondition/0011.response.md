Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is 1 if `c` and `r` are equal, otherwise `num` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The code assigns the values of `c` and `r` from the input, which are now integers. The value of `num` is still dependent on the equality of `c` and `r`. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus three, as two inputs have been consumed by the code.
