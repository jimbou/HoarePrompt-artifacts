Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are integers, `num` is either 4 or 5, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 5.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `num` has been incremented by 2, so it is now either 4 or 5. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 5.
