Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and `t` is currently greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `num` is 2, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `k` - 1, and `c` is not equal to `r`**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to 2, as it was incremented by 2. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `t`, `k`, `c`, and `r` are still valid. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus `k` - 1.
