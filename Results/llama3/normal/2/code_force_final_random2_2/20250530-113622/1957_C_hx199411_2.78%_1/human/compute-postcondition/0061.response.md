Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is equal to `k`, `c` and `r` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `k`-1. If `c` equals `r` for all iterations, then `num` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, `num` is greater than `k`.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, `n` is still an integer, and `i` is now equal to `k`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `c` and `r` are still integers, and the number of test cases in stdin has decreased by `k`-1. The value of `num` depends on whether `c` equals `r` in all iterations. If they are equal in all iterations, then `num` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, `num` is greater than `k`.
