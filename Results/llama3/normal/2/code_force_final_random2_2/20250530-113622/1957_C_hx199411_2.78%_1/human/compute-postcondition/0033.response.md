To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(3, m + 1):`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4. The value of `m` remains the same.

State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is 0, `i` is 4, `m` is an integer and is not equal to 0 and is greater than or equal to 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, dp is a list of length m + 1 with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, dp[3] equal to (dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10**9 + 7), dp[4] is not yet computed**
