Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `num` is 1, `c` and `r` are integers and are equal to each other, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

The code increments the value of `num` by 1, so `num` is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The current value of `c` is still equal to the current value of `r`, and `t` is still a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1. The number of test cases in stdin remains the same, minus two.
