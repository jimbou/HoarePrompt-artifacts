Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num` is 3 if `c` and `r` are equal, otherwise `num` is 4, `c` and `r` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 4.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been incremented by 2, resulting in `num` being 3 if `c` and `r` are equal, and 4 otherwise. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
