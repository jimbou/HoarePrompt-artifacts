Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is currently greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is equal to `k`, `m` is an integer equal to `n` minus `k` or `n` minus `2*k`, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is either `k` or `2*k`, stdin contains no more test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `m` has been updated to be equal to `n` minus `num`, where `num` can be either `k` or `2*k`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains no more test cases.
