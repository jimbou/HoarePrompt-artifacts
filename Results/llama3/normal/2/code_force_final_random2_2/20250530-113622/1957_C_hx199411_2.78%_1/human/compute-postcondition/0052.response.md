Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num` is 1 if `c` and `r` are equal, otherwise `num` is 2, `c` and `r` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 4.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `num` remain unchanged. However, the values of `c` and `r` have been updated to the two integers read from the input, which are separated by a space. The number of test cases in the stdin has decreased by 1, as one test case has been read.
