Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `num` is 0, `c` and `r` are integers, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `num` remain unchanged. The variables `c` and `r` are assigned the values of two integers from the input, which are split by a space. The value of `i` is still 0. The stdin now contains one less test case than before, since one test case has been read and processed.
