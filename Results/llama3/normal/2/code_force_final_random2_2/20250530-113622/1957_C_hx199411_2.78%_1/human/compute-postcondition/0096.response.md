Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is currently greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is either 2 or 3 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `num` is either 3 or 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `k` - 2.***
