Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is currently greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is equal to `k`, `m` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is either `k` or `2*k`, stdin contains no more test cases.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, `n` is still an integer, `i` is now equal to `k`, `m` is still an integer, `c` and `r` are still integers, and `num` has been incremented by either `k` (if all `c` and `r` pairs were equal) or `2*k` (if all `c` and `r` pairs were not equal). Additionally, there are no more test cases left in the standard input.
