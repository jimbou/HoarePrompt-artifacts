Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is 0, `i` is 4, `m` is an integer and is not equal to 0 and is greater than or equal to 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, dp is a list of length m + 1 with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, dp[3] equal to (dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10**9 + 7), dp[4] equal to (dp[3] + (4 - 1) * dp[2] * 2) % (10**9 + 7).**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that the value of dp[4] has been calculated and added to the list dp. The value of dp[4] is calculated using the formula (dp[3] + (4 - 1) * dp[2] * 2) % (10**9 + 7), where dp[3] and dp[2] are previously calculated values.
