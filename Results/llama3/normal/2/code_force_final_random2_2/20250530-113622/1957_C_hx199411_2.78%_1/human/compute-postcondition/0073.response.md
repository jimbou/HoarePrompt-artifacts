Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is 3, `c` and `r` are integers, `m` is an integer and not equal to 0 and also not equal to 1 and `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `num` is either equal to `k` or greater than `k`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k-1`, `dp` is a list of `m+1` integers where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is (dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7) and all other elements are 0**

In this output state, the value of `dp[3]` has been updated based on the given formula, using the previously known values of `dp[1]` and `dp[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
