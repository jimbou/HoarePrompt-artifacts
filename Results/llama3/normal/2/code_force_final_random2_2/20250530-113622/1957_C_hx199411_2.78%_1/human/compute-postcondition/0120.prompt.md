Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is currently greater than 0, n is an integer, i is equal to k, m is an integer equal to n minus k or n minus 2*k and is not equal to 0 or 1, c is an integer, r is an integer, num is either k or 2*k, dp is a list of m+1 elements where dp[1] is 1 and dp[2] is 3 and the rest are 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(3, m + 1):
    dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is currently greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is equal to k and is 3, `m` is an integer equal to n minus k or n minus 2*k, is not equal to 0 or 1, and is at least 3, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is either k or 2*k, `dp` is a list of m+1 elements where dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, dp[3] is (dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is currently greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is equal to k and is 4, `m` is an integer equal to n minus k or n minus 2*k, is not equal to 0 or 1, and is at least 4, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is either k or 2*k, `dp` is a list of m+1 elements where dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, dp[3] is (dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is currently greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is 5, `m` is an integer equal to n minus 5 or n minus 10, is not equal to 0 or 1, and is at least 5, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is either 5 or 10, `dp` is a list of m+1 elements where dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, dp[3] is (dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
