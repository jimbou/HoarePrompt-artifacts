The code prints the value of `dp[m]`, which is the `m`-th element of the list `dp`. The list `dp` is defined recursively, where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for all `i` from 3 to `m`, `dp[i]` is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10**9 + 7)`. This means that the value of `dp[m]` depends on the values of `dp[m - 1]` and `dp[m - 2]`, which in turn depend on the values of `dp[m - 3]` and `dp[m - 4]`, and so on.

Since the exact value of `m` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `dp[m]`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the `m`-th element of the list `dp`, which is a value calculated using the recursive formula.

Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the m-th element of the list dp, calculated using the recursive formula)**
