Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and `t` is currently greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `num` is 0, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `k` - 1**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `k`, `m`, and `num` remain unchanged. The values of `c` and `r` are updated to be the two integers read from the input, separated by a space. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1.
