The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. `num` is 1 if `c` and `r` are equal, otherwise `num` is 2.**
