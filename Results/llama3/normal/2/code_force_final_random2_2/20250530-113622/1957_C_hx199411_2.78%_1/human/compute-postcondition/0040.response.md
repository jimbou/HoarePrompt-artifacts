Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, k is 0, i is 0, m is an integer and is not equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1. If c and r are equal, m is equal to n minus the number of times c and r are equal minus the number of times c and r are not equal. If c and r are not equal, m is equal to n minus twice the number of times c and r are not equal. If m is 1, the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, i is set to m, and dp is a list of length m + 1 with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and dp[i] equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10**9 + 7).***
