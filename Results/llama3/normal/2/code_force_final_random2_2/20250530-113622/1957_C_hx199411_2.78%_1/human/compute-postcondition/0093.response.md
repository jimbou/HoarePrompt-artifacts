Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is currently greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `c` and `r` are assigned the next two integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `k` - 2. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged. The values of `c` and `r` are updated to the next two integers from the input, and the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1. The condition for `num` remains the same, depending on the values of `c` and `r`.
