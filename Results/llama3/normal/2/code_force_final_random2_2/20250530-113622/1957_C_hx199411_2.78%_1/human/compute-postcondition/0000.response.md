Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains an integer n and an integer k on the first line, followed by k lines, each containing two integers r_i and c_i. 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. Since one test case has been read, the number of test cases remaining in the standard input is reduced by one. The values of the other variables are not affected.
