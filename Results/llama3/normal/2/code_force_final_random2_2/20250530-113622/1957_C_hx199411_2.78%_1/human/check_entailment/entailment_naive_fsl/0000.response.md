Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The problem states that the computer will mirror the player's moves, and if the player places a rook on a position (r, c), the computer will place a black rook at position (c, r) in its turn. If r = c, then the computer can't mirror the move, and skips its turn.

The program correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when the game continues after the k moves. It first calculates the number of positions that are blocked by the player's moves and the computer's mirrored moves. Then, it uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations for the remaining positions.

The dynamic programming approach is correct because it considers all possible moves for the remaining positions. The base cases are correctly handled, and the recurrence relation is correctly implemented.

The program also correctly handles the case where there are no valid moves remaining (m = 0) and prints 0. It also correctly handles the case where there is only one valid move remaining (m = 1) and prints 1.

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description and correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when the game continues after the k moves.
