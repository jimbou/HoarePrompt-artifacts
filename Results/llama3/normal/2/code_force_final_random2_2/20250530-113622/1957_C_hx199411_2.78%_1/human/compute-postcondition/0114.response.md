Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is currently greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is equal to k and is 3, `m` is an integer equal to n minus k or n minus 2*k, is not equal to 0 or 1, and is at least 3, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is either k or 2*k, `dp` is a list of m+1 elements where dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, dp[3] is (dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7) and the rest are 0**

In this output state, the value of `dp[3]` has been updated according to the given formula, using the values of `dp[2]` and `dp[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
