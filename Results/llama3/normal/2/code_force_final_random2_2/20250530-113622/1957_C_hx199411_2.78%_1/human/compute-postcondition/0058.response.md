The value of `num` is incremented by 1. The value of `num` can be 2 or 3, so the value of `num` is 3 or 4. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are integers, `num` is either 3 or 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 5.
