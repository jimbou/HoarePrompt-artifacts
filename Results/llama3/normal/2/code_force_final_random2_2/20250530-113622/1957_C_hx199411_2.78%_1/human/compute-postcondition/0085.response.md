To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `k` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and `t` is currently greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is equal to `k` if `m` is 0 or 1, otherwise `i` is equal to `m`, `c` and `r` are integers, `m` is an integer, `num` is 0, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k`. However, these states do not guarantee the loop will execute.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states as follows:

* `k` must be greater than 0.
* `i` is now 0 (since the loop will start from the first iteration).

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `c`, `r`, `m`, `num`, and `stdin`) are not directly related to the loop execution and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and `t` is currently greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `c` and `r` are integers, `m` is an integer, `num` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k`**
