Output: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, k is 0, i is 0, m is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1. If c and r are equal, the current value of m is equal to n minus the number of times c and r are equal minus the number of times c and r are not equal. If c and r are not equal, the current value of m is equal to n minus twice the number of times c and r are not equal, and 0 is printed**
