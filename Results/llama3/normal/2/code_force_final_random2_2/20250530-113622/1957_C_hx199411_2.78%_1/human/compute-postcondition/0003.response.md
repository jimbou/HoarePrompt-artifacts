The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, num is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, k is an integer greater than 0, num is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 0**
