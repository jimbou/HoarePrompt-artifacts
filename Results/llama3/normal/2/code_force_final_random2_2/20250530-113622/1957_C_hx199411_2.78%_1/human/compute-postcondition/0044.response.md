To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `k` is at least 1. Since `i` is initially 0, we can adjust its state to be 0, and `k` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `num` is 0**
