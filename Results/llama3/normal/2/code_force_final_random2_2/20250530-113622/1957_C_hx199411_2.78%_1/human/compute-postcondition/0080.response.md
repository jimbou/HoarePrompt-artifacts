Output: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and t currently must be greater than 0, n is an integer, i is equal to m, c and r are integers, m is an integer and not equal to 0 and also not equal to 1, num is either equal to k or greater than k, stdin contains multiple test cases minus k-1, dp is a list of m+1 integers where dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, and for all i from 3 to m, dp[i] is (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10**9 + 7), and the value of dp[m] is being printed**
