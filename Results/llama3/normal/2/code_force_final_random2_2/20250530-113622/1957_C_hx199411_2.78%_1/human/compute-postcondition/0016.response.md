Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four. If `c` and `r` are equal, `num` is 2. If `c` and `r` are not equal, `num` is 4.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `c` and `r` are updated to the integers from the input. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus four. The condition for `num` remains the same, depending on whether `c` and `r` are equal or not.
