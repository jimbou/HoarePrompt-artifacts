Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer, i is equal to m, m is an integer equal to n minus k or n minus 2 times k, c is an integer, r is an integer, num is either k or 2 times k, stdin contains no more test cases. If m is 0, the value 0 is being printed. If m is 1, the number 1 is being printed. Otherwise, dp is a list of m+1 elements where dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, and for all i from 3 to m, dp[i] is (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the value of t is now 0. The values of n, i, m, c, r, and num are as they were after the last iteration of the loop. The stdin contains no more test cases, and the loop has printed the appropriate value based on the value of m. If m is 0, the loop printed 0. If m is 1, the loop printed 1. If m is greater than 1, the loop printed the value of dp[m], which is calculated using the recurrence relation dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7).
