Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is 5, `c` and `r` are integers, `m` is an integer and not equal to 0 and also not equal to 1 and `m` must be greater than or equal to 5, `num` is either equal to `k` or greater than `k`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k-1`, `dp` is a list of `m+1` integers where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is (dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10**9 + 7), `dp[4]` is (dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % (10**9 + 7), `dp[5]` is (dp[4] + 4 * dp[3] * 2) % (10**9 + 7).**

The code updates the value of `dp[i]` using the values of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]`. Since `i` is 5, the code updates the value of `dp[5]`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
