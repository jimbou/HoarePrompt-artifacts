Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num` is 2, `c` and `r` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3, and `c` is not equal to `r`.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to 2, as it was incremented by 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still a positive integer, equal to its original value minus 2, and greater than 0. The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `c`, and `r` are still the same, and the condition `c` is not equal to `r` still holds. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 3.
