To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 3, since the range starts from 3.

State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is currently greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is equal to k and is 3, `m` is an integer equal to n minus k or n minus 2*k, is not equal to 0 or 1, and is at least 3, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is either k or 2*k, `dp` is a list of m+1 elements where dp[1] is 1 and dp[2] is 3 and the rest are 0**
