Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is equal to `k`, `c` and `r` are integers, `m` is an integer, `num` is either equal to `k` or greater than `k`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `k`-1.**

In this output state, the value of `m` is assigned as `n - num`. The value of `num` can be either equal to `k` or greater than `k`, depending on the condition that `c` equals `r` for all iterations. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus `k`-1.
