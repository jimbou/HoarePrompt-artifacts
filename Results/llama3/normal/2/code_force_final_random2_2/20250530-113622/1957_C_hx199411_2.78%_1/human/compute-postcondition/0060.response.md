Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 5. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `num` is either 4 or 5.***
