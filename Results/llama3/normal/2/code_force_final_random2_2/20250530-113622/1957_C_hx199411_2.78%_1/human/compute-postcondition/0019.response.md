Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four. If `c` and `r` are equal, `num` is 3. If `c` and `r` are not equal, `num` is 5. If `c` and `r` are equal, `num` is 4. If `c` and `r` are not equal, `num` is 6.***
