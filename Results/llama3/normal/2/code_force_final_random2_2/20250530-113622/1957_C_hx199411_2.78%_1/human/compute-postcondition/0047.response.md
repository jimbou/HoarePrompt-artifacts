Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num` is 1, `c` and `r` are integers and equal to each other, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `c` and `r` is still valid, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 3.
