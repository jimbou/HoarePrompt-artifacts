Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is currently greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, if `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is either 3 or 4, otherwise `num` is either 4 or 5, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `k` - 3.***
