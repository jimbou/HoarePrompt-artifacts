Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is currently greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `num` is 1, `c` is an integer equal to `r`, `r` is an integer equal to `c`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus `k` - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus `k` - 1.
