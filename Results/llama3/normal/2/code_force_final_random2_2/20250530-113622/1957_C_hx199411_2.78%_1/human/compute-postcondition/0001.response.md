To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition, which is simply `while t:`. This means the loop will execute as long as `t` is not zero.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases,
- stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
- Each test case contains an integer n and an integer k on the first line, followed by k lines, each containing two integers r_i and c_i.
- 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= n.
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

The only variable in the loop head is `t`. Since `t` is already stated to be a positive integer, it inherently means `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed to the state of `t` for the loop to execute the first time, as the condition for the loop to proceed (`t` being greater than 0) is already met by the given state.

State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains an integer n and an integer k on the first line, followed by k lines, each containing two integers r_i and c_i. 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
