Output State: `t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is currently greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is equal to `m`, `m` is an integer equal to `n` minus `k` or `n` minus 2*`k`, is not equal to 0 or 1, and is at least 3, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is either `k` or 2*`k`, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for all `i` from 3 to `m`, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `t` remains a positive integer, `n` remains an integer, `i` becomes equal to `m`, `m` remains an integer equal to `n` minus `k` or `n` minus 2*`k`, not equal to 0 or 1, and at least 3, `c` and `r` remain integers, `num` remains either `k` or 2*`k`, and `dp` becomes a list of `m+1` elements where the first two elements are 1 and 3, respectively, and the rest of the elements are calculated using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` for `i` from 3 to `m`.
