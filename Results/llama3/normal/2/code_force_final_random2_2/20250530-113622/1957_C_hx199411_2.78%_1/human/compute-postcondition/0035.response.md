The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `m` must be greater than 4.
State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is 0, `i` is 5, `m` is an integer and is not equal to 0 and is greater than or equal to 5, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, dp is a list of length m + 1 with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, dp[3] equal to (dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10**9 + 7), dp[4] equal to (dp[3] + (4 - 1) * dp[2] * 2) % (10**9 + 7)**
