Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is currently greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is either 2 or 3 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `num` is either 3 or 4, `c` and `r` are assigned the values of two integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `k` - 3**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `k`, `m` remain unchanged. The values of `c` and `r` are updated to the two integers from the input. The value of `num` is still dependent on the values of `c` and `r`. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1.
