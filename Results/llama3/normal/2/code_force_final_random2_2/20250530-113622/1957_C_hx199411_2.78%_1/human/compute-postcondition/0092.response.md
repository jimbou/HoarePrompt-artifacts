To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `k` remains the same.

State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is currently greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `k` - 1. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2.**
