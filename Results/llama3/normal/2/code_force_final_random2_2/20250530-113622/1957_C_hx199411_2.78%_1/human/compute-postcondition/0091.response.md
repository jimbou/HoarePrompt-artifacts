Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is currently greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `k` - 1. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2.***
