Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are integers, `num` is either 2 or 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 5.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `c` and `r` are updated to the two integers input from stdin, which contains multiple test cases minus 5. The value of `num` is either 2 or 3, depending on whether `c` and `r` are equal or not.
