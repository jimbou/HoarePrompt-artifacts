Output State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, k is 0, i is m, m is an integer and is not equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, dp is a list of length m + 1 with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and dp[i] equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7) for all i from 3 to m.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `i` is now equal to `m`, and the list `dp` has been updated according to the loop's body for all indices from 3 to `m`. The other variables remain unchanged.
