Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num` is 1 if `c` and `r` are equal, otherwise `num` is 2, `c` and `r` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3.***
