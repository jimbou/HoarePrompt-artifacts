Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is 4, `c` and `r` are integers, `m` is an integer and not equal to 0 and also not equal to 1 and `m` must be greater than or equal to 4, `num` is either equal to `k` or greater than `k`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `k-1`, `dp` is a list of `m+1` integers where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is (dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10**9 + 7), `dp[4]` is (dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % (10**9 + 7)**

The code calculates the value of `dp[i]` where `i` is 4, using the previously calculated values of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]`. The value of `dp[4]` is calculated as `(dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % (10**9 + 7)`, where `dp[3]` is `(dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10**9 + 7)`, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[1]` is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
