Output State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and t currently must be greater than 0, n is an integer, i is equal to m, c and r are integers, m is an integer and not equal to 0 and also not equal to 1, num is either equal to k or greater than k, stdin contains multiple test cases minus k-1, dp is a list of m+1 integers where dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, and for all i from 3 to m, dp[i] is (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7).**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `m`, and the list `dp` will have been updated according to the recurrence relation defined in the loop body. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
