Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, l is a sorted list of integers, t is 0, s is 0, c is 0, i is n, stdin contains no input**

The code snippet provided assigns new values to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input, overwriting their initial values. The list `l` is reassigned to a new sorted list of integers from the input. The variables `t`, `s`, and `c` are reset to 0. The variable `i` is not explicitly modified in the code snippet, so it retains its initial value, which is `n`. After the execution of the code, stdin is empty since all inputs have been consumed.
