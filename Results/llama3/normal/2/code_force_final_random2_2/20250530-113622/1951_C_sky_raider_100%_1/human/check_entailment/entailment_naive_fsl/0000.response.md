Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to purchase tickets. The problem statement requires that the price per ticket be increased by the number of tickets purchased on each day, but the program does not take this into account. It simply sorts the prices and then purchases the minimum number of tickets on each day, without considering the impact of the price increase on future days.

For example, consider the input:

4 2 3
8 6 4 2

The program will sort the prices to get [2, 4, 6, 8] and then purchase 2 tickets on the first day (price 2), 1 ticket on the second day (price 4), and 0 tickets on the remaining days. However, this is not the optimal solution. A better solution would be to purchase 1 ticket on the third day (price 4) and 2 tickets on the fourth day (price 6), resulting in a total cost of 10.

The program does not consider this optimal solution because it does not take into account the price increase caused by purchasing tickets on each day. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
