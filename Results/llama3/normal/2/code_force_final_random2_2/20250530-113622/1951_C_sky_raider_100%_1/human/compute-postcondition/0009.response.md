The code prints the integer value of `c`, which is calculated as `n * s * (l[i] + (n-1) * min(m, k))`. 

Here, `n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n-1`, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer minus `n * min(m, k)`, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `t` is `n * min(m, k)`, `s` is `min(m, k)`, and `c` is `n * s * (l[i] + (n-1) * min(m, k))`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the elements of the list `l` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `c`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `c`.

Output: **n * min(m, k) * (l[n-1] + (n-1) * min(m, k)) (where n is at least n, m is an integer, k is an integer minus n * min(m, k), and l is a sorted list of integers)**
