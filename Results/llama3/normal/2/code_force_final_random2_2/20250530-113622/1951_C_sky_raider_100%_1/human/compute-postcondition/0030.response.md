Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer, l is a sorted list of integers, i is n, s is the minimum of m and k, t is the sum of the minimum of m and k for n iterations, c is the sum of the minimum of m and k times the sum of the elements of l and the minimum of m and k for n iterations, k is the difference of k and the sum of the minimum of m and k for n iterations.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is:

The loop will execute until `i` reaches `n`. After each iteration, `s` will be set to the minimum of `m` and `k`, `t` will be incremented by `s`, `c` will be incremented by `s` times the sum of the current element of `l` and `t`, and `k` will be decremented by `s`.

After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `s` will be the minimum of `m` and `k`, `t` will be the sum of the minimum of `m` and `k` for `n` iterations, `c` will be the sum of the minimum of `m` and `k` times the sum of the elements of `l` and the minimum of `m` and `k` for `n` iterations, and `k` will be the difference of `k` and the sum of the minimum of `m` and `k` for `n` iterations.

Note that the state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body, such as `m` and `l`, remain unchanged.
