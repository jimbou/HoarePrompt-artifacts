The code snippet reads two lines of input from stdin, assigns values to variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `l`, and initializes variables `t`, `s`, and `c` to 0. After executing the code, the state of the variables is as follows:

*   `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers, with values assigned from the first line of input.
*   `l` is a sorted list of integers, with values assigned from the second line of input.
*   `t`, `s`, and `c` are integers, all initialized to 0.
*   `i` remains 0, as it is not modified by the code.
*   Stdin is empty, as two lines of input have been read.

Output State: **n, m, and k are integers, l is a sorted list of integers, t, s, and c are 0, i is 0, stdin is empty.**
