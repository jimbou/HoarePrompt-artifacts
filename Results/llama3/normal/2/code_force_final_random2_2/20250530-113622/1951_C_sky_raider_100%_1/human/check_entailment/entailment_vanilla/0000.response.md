Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases (t) and then iterating over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of sale days (n), the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m), and the number of tickets to be bought (k).
3. It then reads the prices per ticket for each of the upcoming n days and stores them in a list (l).
4. The program sorts the list of prices in ascending order.
5. It initializes three variables: t (total tickets purchased), s (tickets purchased in the current day), and c (total cost).
6. The program then iterates over the sorted list of prices. For each price, it calculates the number of tickets that can be purchased on that day (s) as the minimum of m and k.
7. It then calculates the cost of purchasing s tickets on that day by multiplying s with the current price plus the total tickets purchased so far (t).
8. It adds the cost to the total cost (c) and increments the total tickets purchased (t) by s.
9. It subtracts s from k to keep track of the remaining tickets to be purchased.
10. Finally, it prints the total cost (c) as the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program is not correctly implementing the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The program is simply sorting the prices and then iterating over them, which is not sufficient to find the minimum spending.

The correct approach would be to use a dynamic programming table to store the minimum spending for each possible number of tickets purchased up to each day. The program should then fill up this table by iterating over the days and the possible number of tickets purchased, and finally return the minimum spending for purchasing k tickets.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
