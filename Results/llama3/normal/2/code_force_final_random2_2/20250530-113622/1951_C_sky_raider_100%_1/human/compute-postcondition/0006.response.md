To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. This means that the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` is at least 2, it must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `m`, `k`, `l`, `t`, `s`, and `c` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer minus 2 * min(m, k), `l` is a sorted list of integers, `t` is 2 * min(m, k), `s` is min(m, k), `c` is 2 * s * (l[i] + min(m, k))**
