This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines of input. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function sorts the list of integers, then iterates over the sorted list, calculating a cumulative sum c by multiplying the minimum of m and k by the sum of the current integer and the cumulative sum of the minimum of m and k. The function prints the integer value of c for each test case.
