Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, k is an integer minus the minimum of m and k, l is a sorted list of integers, t is the minimum of m and k, s is the minimum of m and k, c is s times the sum of the ith element of l and t, i is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs**

The code block modifies the variables s, t, k, and c. The first line assigns the minimum value between m and k to s. The second line increments c by the product of s and the sum of the ith element of l and t. The third line increments t by s. The fourth line decrements k by s. The other variables remain unchanged.
