The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer minus min(m, k), `l` is a sorted list of integers, `t` is min(m, k), `s` is min(m, k), `c` is s * (l[i] + 0)**
