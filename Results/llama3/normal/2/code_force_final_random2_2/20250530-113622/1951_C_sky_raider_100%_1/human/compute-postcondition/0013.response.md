The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `t` is 0, `s` is 0, `c` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs**
