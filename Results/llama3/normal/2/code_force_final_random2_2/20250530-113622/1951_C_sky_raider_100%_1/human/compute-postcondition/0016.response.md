Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, k is an integer minus twice the minimum of m and k, l is a sorted list of integers, t is twice the minimum of m and k, s is the minimum of m and k, c is s times the sum of the ith element of l and t plus s times the sum of the ith element of l and t, i is 1, stdin contains 0 inputs**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer greater than 0. The value of `m` also remains unchanged as an integer. The value of `k` is reduced by twice the minimum of `m` and `k`. The list `l` remains a sorted list of integers. The value of `t` is now twice the minimum of `m` and `k`. The value of `s` remains the minimum of `m` and `k`. The value of `c` is increased by `s` times the sum of the `i`-th element of `l` and `t`, plus `s` times the sum of the `i`-th element of `l` and `t`. The value of `i` remains 1. The stdin remains empty, containing 0 inputs.
