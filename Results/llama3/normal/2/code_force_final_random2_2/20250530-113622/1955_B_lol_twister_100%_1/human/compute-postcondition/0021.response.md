Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l, `a` is the smallest integer in l, `li` is a list containing 2n+1 elements which are `a + d * h` for h in range(0, n) and the last n elements are `a + k * c + d * h` for k=1 and h in range(0, n) and the last element is `a + 2 * c + d * 0`, `k` is 2, `h` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**

In this output state, the list `li` has been updated by appending a new element which is `a + 2 * c + d * 0`, where `a` is the smallest integer in list `l`, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, and `k` is 2 and `h` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
