Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l, `a` is the smallest integer in l, `li` is a list containing one element which is `a + d`, `k` is 0, `h` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `li` has been updated to contain one element which is `a + d`, where `a` is the smallest integer in list `l` and `d` is an integer such that 1 <= d <= 10^6. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
