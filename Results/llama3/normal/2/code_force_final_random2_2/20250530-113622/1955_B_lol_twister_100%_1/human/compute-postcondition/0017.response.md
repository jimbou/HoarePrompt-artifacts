Output State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l, `a` is the smallest integer in l, `li` is a list containing 2n elements which are `a + d * h` for h in range(0, n) and the last n elements are `a + k * c + d * h` for k=1 and h in range(0, n), `k` is 1, `h` is n-1

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `n` remains the same, within the range of 2 to 500.
* The values of `c` and `d` remain the same, within the range of 1 to 10^6.
* The list `l` remains the same, containing n^2 integers within the range of 1 to 10^9.
* The value of `a` remains the same, being the smallest integer in list `l`.
* The list `li` now contains 2n elements. The first n elements are the same as before, containing `a + d * h` for h in range(0, n). The last n elements are new, containing `a + k * c + d * h` for k=1 and h in range(0, n).
* The value of `k` remains the same, being 1.
* The value of `h` is now n-1, indicating that the loop has executed n times.
