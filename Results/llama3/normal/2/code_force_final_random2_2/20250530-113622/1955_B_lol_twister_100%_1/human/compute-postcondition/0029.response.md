Output State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l, `a` is the smallest integer in l, `li` is a list containing n^2 elements which are `a + k * c + d * h` for k in range(0, n) and h in range(0, n), `k` is n, `h` is n - 1.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `li` now contains n^2 elements. Each element is the sum of `a`, `k` times `c`, and `d` times `h`, where `k` and `h` are the current iteration numbers. The values of `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, and `a` remain unchanged.
