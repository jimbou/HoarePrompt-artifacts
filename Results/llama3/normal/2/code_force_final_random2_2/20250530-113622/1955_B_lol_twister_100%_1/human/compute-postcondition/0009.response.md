Output State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l, `a` is the smallest integer in l, `li` is a list containing n elements which are `a + d * h` for h in range(0, n), `k` is 0, `h` is n - 1

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `li` will contain `n` elements, each of which is the sum of `a` and `d` times the current iteration number `h`. The other variables remain unchanged.
