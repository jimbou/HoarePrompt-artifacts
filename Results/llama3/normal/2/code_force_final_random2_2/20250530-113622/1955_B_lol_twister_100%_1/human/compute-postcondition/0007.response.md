Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l, `a` is the smallest integer in l, `li` is a list containing three elements which are `a + d`, `a + d`, and `a + d * 2`, `k` is 0, `h` is 2**

The code appends a new element to the list `li`, which is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`. Since `k` is 0, the expression simplifies to `a + d * 2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `li` now contains three elements: `a + d`, `a + d`, and `a + d * 2`.
