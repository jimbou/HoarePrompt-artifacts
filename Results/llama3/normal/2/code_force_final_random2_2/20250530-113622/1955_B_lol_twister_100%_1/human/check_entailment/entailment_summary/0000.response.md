Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the rules for constructing a progressive square and checks if the given list of integers can be rearranged into this pattern. The program first finds the smallest integer in the list, which is the top-left element of the square. It then generates the rest of the elements in the square by adding the product of c and d with each pair of iteration numbers. The program then sorts both lists and checks if they are equal. If they are equal, it means that the original list can be rearranged into the progressive square, and the program returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

The program also correctly handles the case where the input list cannot be rearranged into a progressive square. In this case, the sorted lists will not be equal, and the program will return 'no'.

The time complexity of the program is O(n^2 log n) due to the sorting operation, which is acceptable given the constraints of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
