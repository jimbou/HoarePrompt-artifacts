Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l, `a` is the smallest integer in l, `li` is a list containing n+3 elements which are `a + d * h` for h in range(0, n) and the last three elements are `a + k * c + d * h` for k=1 and h=1, `a + k * c + d * h` for k=1 and h=2 and `a + k * c + d * h` for k=1 and h=2, `k` is 1, `h` is 2**

In this output state, the list `li` has been updated by appending a new element `a + k * c + d * h` with `k` equal to 1 and `h` equal to 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
