Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining if a given array of integers can be rearranged into a progressive square of size n, based on the provided values of c and d.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the values of n, c, and d, and the array of integers (l).

3. The function func_1 is then called with these values as arguments.

4. Inside func_1, the minimum value in the array (a) is found. This is assumed to be the value of a_{1,1} in the progressive square.

5. The function then constructs a list (li) of values that would be present in the progressive square, based on the given values of n, c, and d.

6. The list li is sorted in ascending order.

7. The input array l is also sorted in ascending order.

8. The function then checks if the sorted array l is equal to the sorted list li. If they are equal, it returns 'yes', indicating that the array can be rearranged into a progressive square. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

The program's logic is correct and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
