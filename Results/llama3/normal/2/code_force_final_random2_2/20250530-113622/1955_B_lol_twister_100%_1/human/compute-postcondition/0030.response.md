Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, c and d are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, l is a sorted list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l, a is the smallest integer in l, li is a sorted list containing n^2 elements which are a + k * c + d * h for k in range(0, n) and h in range(0, n), k is n, h is n - 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the code executes is that the list `l` is now sorted in ascending order, and the list `li` is also sorted in ascending order. The values of `n`, `c`, `d`, and `a` remain unchanged. The list `l` contains the same `n^2` integers as before, but now they are in sorted order. The list `li` contains the same `n^2` elements as before, which are the sum of `a`, `k` times `c`, and `d` times `h`, where `k` and `h` are the current iteration numbers, but now they are in sorted order.
