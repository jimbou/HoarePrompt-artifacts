Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, c and d are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, l is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l, a is the smallest integer in l, and li is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(0, n):
    for h in range(0, n):
        li.append(a + k * c + d * h)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l, `a` is the smallest integer in l, `li` is a list containing n elements which are `a + d * h` for h in range(0, n), `k` is 0, `h` is n - 1

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `li` will contain `n` elements, each of which is the sum of `a` and `d` times the current iteration number `h`. The other variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l, `a` is the smallest integer in l, `li` is a list containing 2n elements which are `a + d * h` for h in range(0, n) and the last n elements are `a + k * c + d * h` for k=1 and h in range(0, n), `k` is 1, `h` is n-1.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `li` now contains 2n elements. The first n elements are the same as before, which are `a + d * h` for h in range(0, n). The last n elements are `a + k * c + d * h` for k=1 and h in range(0, n). The values of `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`, `k`, and `h` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l, `a` is the smallest integer in l, `li` is a list containing 3n elements which are `a + d * h` for h in range(0, n) and the last 2n elements are `a + k * c + d * h` for k=1 and h in range(0, n) and the last n elements are `a + 2 * c + d * h` for h in range(0, n), `k` is 2, `h` is n-1, `n` must be greater than 1

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `li` now contains 3n elements. The first n elements are the same as before, which are `a + d * h` for h in range(0, n). The next n elements are the same as before, which are `a + k * c + d * h` for k=1 and h in range(0, n). The last n elements are new, which are `a + 2 * c + d * h` for h in range(0, n). The values of `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`, and `k` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
