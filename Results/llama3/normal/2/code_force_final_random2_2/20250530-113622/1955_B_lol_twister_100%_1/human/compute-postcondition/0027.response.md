Output State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l, `a` is the smallest integer in l, `li` is a list containing 3n elements which are `a + d * h` for h in range(0, n) and the last 2n elements are `a + k * c + d * h` for k=1 and h in range(0, n) and the last n elements are `a + 2 * c + d * h` for h in range(0, n), `k` is 2, `h` is n-1, `n` must be greater than 1

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `li` now contains 3n elements. The first n elements are the same as before, which are `a + d * h` for h in range(0, n). The next n elements are the same as before, which are `a + k * c + d * h` for k=1 and h in range(0, n). The last n elements are new, which are `a + 2 * c + d * h` for h in range(0, n). The values of `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`, and `k` remain unchanged.
