Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l, `a` is the smallest integer in l, `li` is a list containing n+1 elements which are `a + d * h` for h in range(0, n) and the last element is `a + k * c + d * h`, `k` is 1, `h` is 0**

In this output state, the list `li` has been updated by appending a new element which is `a + k * c + d * h`. The value of `k` is 1 and `h` is 0, so the new element is `a + c`. The other variables remain unchanged.
