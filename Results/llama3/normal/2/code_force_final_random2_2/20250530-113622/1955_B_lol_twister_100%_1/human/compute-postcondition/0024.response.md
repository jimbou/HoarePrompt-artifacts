The only variable in the loop head is variable `h`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h` and `n`. If `h` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `h` must be increased by 1 so `h` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l, `a` is the smallest integer in l, `li` is a list containing 2n+2 elements which are `a + d * h` for h in range(0, n) and the last n elements are `a + k * c + d * h` for k=1 and h in range(0, n) and the last two elements are `a + 2 * c + d * 0` and `a + 2 * c + d * 1`, `k` is 2, `h` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**
