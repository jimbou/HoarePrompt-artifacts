This function determines whether a given list of integers can be rearranged into a specific pattern. It takes as input a list of n^2 integers, where n is an integer between 2 and 500, and two integers c and d between 1 and 10^6. The function first finds the smallest integer in the list, then generates a new list of n^2 integers by adding the smallest integer to the product of c and d with each pair of iteration numbers. The function then sorts both lists and checks if they are equal. If they are equal, the function returns 'yes', indicating that the original list can be rearranged into the specific pattern. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.
