To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for h in range(0, n):`.

The only variable in the loop head is `h`. According to the code, `h` takes values from `range(0, n)`, which means `h` will be incremented by 1 at each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `h` is 0. To execute the loop again, `h` should be incremented to 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l, `a` is the smallest integer in l, `li` is a list containing 2n+1 elements which are `a + d * h` for h in range(0, n) and the last n elements are `a + k * c + d * h` for k=1 and h in range(0, n) and the last element is `a + 2 * c + d * 0`, `k` is 2, `h` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
