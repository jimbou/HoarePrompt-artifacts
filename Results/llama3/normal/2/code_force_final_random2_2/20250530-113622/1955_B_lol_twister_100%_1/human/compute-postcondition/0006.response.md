To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `h` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `h` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `h` is 1 and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500.

For the loop to execute again, `h` needs to be incremented by 1, so `h` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but we need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 2 to satisfy the loop condition.

The other variables `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`, `li`, and `k` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l, `a` is the smallest integer in l, `li` is a list containing two elements which are `a + d` and `a + d`, `k` is 0, `h` is 2**
