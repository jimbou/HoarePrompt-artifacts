Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l, `a` is the smallest integer in l, `li` is a list containing two elements which are `a + d` and `a + d`, `k` is 0, `h` is 1**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`, `k`, and `h` remain unchanged. The list `li` now contains two elements: the original element `a + d` and the newly appended element `a + k * c + d * h`, which simplifies to `a + d` since `k` is 0 and `h` is 1.
