Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, c and d are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, l is a sorted list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l, a is the smallest integer in l, li is a sorted list containing n^2 elements which are a + k * c + d * h for k in range(0, n) and h in range(0, n), k is n, h is n - 1. The current value of l is equal to the current value of li.***
