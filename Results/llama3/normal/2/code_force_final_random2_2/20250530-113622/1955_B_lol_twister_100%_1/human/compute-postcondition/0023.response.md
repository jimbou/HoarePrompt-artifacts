Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l, `a` is the smallest integer in l, `li` is a list containing 2n+2 elements which are `a + d * h` for h in range(0, n) and the last n elements are `a + k * c + d * h` for k=1 and h in range(0, n) and the last two elements are `a + 2 * c + d * 0` and `a + 2 * c + d * 1`, `k` is 2, `h` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values except for the list `li`, which now has an additional element `a + 2 * c + d * 1` appended to it. The list `li` now contains 2n+2 elements, with the last two elements being `a + 2 * c + d * 0` and `a + 2 * c + d * 1`.
