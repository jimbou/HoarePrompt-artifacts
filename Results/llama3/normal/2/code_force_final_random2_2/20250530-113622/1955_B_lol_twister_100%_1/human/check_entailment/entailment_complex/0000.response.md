Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input values of `n`, `c`, `d`, and the list `l` from the user.
2. It finds the smallest integer `a` in the list `l`, which is the first element of the progressive square.
3. It generates a new list `li` containing `n^2` elements, where each element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` in range(0, `n`) and `h` in range(0, `n`). This is the correct formula for generating the elements of the progressive square.
4. It sorts both lists `l` and `li` in ascending order.
5. It checks if the sorted lists `l` and `li` are equal. If they are equal, it means that the original list `l` can be rearranged into the progressive square pattern, and the program returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

The program's logic is correct, and it follows the problem description accurately. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
