Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to determine if a given list of integers can form a progressive square based on the problem description. The program first calculates the smallest integer 'a' in the list, then generates a list 'li' containing the elements of the progressive square using the formula 'a + k * c + d * h'. It then sorts both lists and checks if they are equal. If they are equal, it returns 'yes', indicating that the list can form a progressive square. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

The program correctly implements the logic to generate the progressive square and compare it with the given list. It also handles the sorting of the lists correctly.

However, there is a small issue with the function name. The function is called 'func_1', but it is not defined anywhere in the code. It should be defined as a separate function or the name should be changed to match the actual function definition.

Correctness: **True**
