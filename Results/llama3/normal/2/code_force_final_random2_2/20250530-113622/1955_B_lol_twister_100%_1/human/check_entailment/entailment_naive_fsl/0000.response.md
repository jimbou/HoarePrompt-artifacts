Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the rules for constructing a progressive square and checks if the given array elements can form such a square. Here's why:

1. The program first finds the minimum element `a` in the array `l`, which represents the top-left element of the progressive square.
2. It then constructs the progressive square by iterating over the rows and columns, calculating the value of each element using the formula `a + k * c + d * h`, where `k` is the row index and `h` is the column index.
3. The program sorts both the constructed progressive square `li` and the input array `l`.
4. Finally, it checks if the sorted arrays are equal. If they are, it returns 'yes', indicating that the array elements can form a progressive square. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the array elements can form a progressive square, it returns 'yes'.
* When the array elements cannot form a progressive square, it returns 'no'.
* When the input array is empty or contains duplicate elements, the program still works correctly.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
