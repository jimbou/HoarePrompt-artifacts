To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `h`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `h` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `h` is 0 and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500.

To execute the loop again, `h` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `h` should be 1.

The other variables `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`, `li`, and `k` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l, `a` is the smallest integer in l, `li` is a list containing one element which is `a + d`, `k` is 0, `h` is 1**
