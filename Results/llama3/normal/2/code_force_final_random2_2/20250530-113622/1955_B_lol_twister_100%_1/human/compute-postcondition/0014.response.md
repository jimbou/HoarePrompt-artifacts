Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l, `a` is the smallest integer in l, `li` is a list containing n+2 elements which are `a + d * h` for h in range(0, n) and the last two elements are `a + k * c + d * h` and `a + k * c + d * h` with k=1 and h=1, `k` is 1, `h` is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, and `a` remains the same as in the initial state. The list `li` now contains n+2 elements, where the first n elements are `a + d * h` for h in range(0, n), and the last two elements are `a + k * c + d * h` with k=1 and h=1. The values of `k` and `h` are still 1.
