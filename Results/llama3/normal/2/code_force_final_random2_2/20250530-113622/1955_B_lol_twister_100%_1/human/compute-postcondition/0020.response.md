The only variable in the loop head is `h` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 500, `h` is n-1, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `h` is 0.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l, `a` is the smallest integer in l, `li` is a list containing 2n elements which are `a + d * h` for h in range(0, n) and the last n elements are `a + k * c + d * h` for k=1 and h in range(0, n), `k` is 2, `h` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
