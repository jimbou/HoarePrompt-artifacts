The only variable in the loop head is variable  k and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500. For the loop to execute again k is increased by 1 so k is 1 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l, `a` is the smallest integer in l, `li` is a list containing n elements which are `a + d * h` for h in range(0, n), `k` is 1, `h` is n - 1**
