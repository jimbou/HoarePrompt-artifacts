Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, cnt is a list of n+1 integers where cnt[x] is 0 for all x, x is the last element in the list cnt, ans is not defined, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer that was read from the input. The list `a` contains `n` integers that were also read from the input. The list `cnt` is initialized with `n+1` zeros, and `x` is still the last element in the list `cnt`. The variable `ans` is not defined because it was not assigned a value in the given code snippet. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs because two inputs were read in the code.
