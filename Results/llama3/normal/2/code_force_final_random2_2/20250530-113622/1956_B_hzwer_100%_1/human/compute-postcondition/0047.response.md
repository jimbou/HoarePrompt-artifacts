Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, cnt is a list of n+1 integers where cnt[x] is the number of occurrences of x in a, x is the last element in the list a, ans is not defined, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `cnt` now contains the count of each integer in the list `a`, and the variable `x` is the last element in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
