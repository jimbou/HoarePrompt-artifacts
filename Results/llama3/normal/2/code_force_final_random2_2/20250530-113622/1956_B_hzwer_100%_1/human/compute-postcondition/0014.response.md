The value of `ans` is increased by `max(0, x - 1)`. The value of `x` is the second element in the list `cnt`, and `ans` is initially `max(0, x - 1)`. So, the new value of `ans` is `max(0, x - 1) + max(0, x - 1)`, which is `2 * max(0, x - 1)`. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in the original list `a` and must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in the list `cnt`, `ans` is `2 * max(0, x - 1)`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**
