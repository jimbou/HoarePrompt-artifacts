Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a positive integer n. The second line contains n positive integers. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and input reads from standard input one line at a time.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = [0] * (n + 1)
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] += 1
    ans = 0
    for x in cnt:
        ans += max(0, x - 1)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in the original list `a` and is empty, `x` is the last element in the list `cnt`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt` which is equal to `ans` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is at least 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a` and 0 for all other `x`, `x` is the last element in the list `cnt`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, cnt[i] - 1)` for all `i` in the list `cnt`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs, and the sum of `max(0, cnt[i] - 1)` for all `i` in the list `cnt` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `x` is the last element in the list `cnt`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, cnt[x] - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the sum of `max(0, cnt[x] - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
