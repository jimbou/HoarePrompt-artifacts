Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is 1 for the first element in the list `a` and 0 for all other `x`, `x` is the first element in the list `a`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt` which is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[x]` has been updated to 1 for the first element `x` in the list `a`, while all other elements in `cnt` remain 0. The values of `n`, `a`, `x`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
