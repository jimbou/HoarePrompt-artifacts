Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 3 integers, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is 3 and `cnt[y]` is 0 for all `y != x`, `x` is the third element in the list `a`, `ans` is not defined, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[x]` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. The values of the other variables remain the same. The list `a` still has at least 3 integers, and `x` is still the third element in the list. The list `cnt` still has `n+1` integers, but the value of `cnt[x]` has changed to 3. The variable `ans` is still not defined, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
