The only variable in the loop head is variable  x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cnt`. If `cnt` has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` has at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in the list `cnt`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list `cnt` must have at least 3 elements and the `x` is the third element in the list `cnt`. Also, `ans` is `max(0, x - 1)` more than `max(0, x - 1)`, so `ans` is `max(0, x - 1)` more than `max(0, x - 1)`.
State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `x` is the third element in the list `cnt`, `ans` is `max(0, x - 1)` more than `max(0, x - 1)`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**
