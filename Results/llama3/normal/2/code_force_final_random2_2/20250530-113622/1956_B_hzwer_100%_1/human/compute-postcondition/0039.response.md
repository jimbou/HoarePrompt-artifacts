The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and the input, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input has at least one more test case the loop executes again for the next test case. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs. So for the loop to be executed one more time the stdin must contain multiple test cases minus `n+1` inputs.
State: **`n` is at least 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a` and 0 for all other `x`, `x` is the last element in the list `cnt`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, cnt[i] - 1)` for all `i` in the list `cnt`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n+1` inputs, and the sum of `max(0, cnt[i] - 1)` for all `i` in the list `cnt` is being printed**
