Output State: **`n` is at least 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a` and 0 for all other `x`, `x` is the first element in the list `cnt`, `ans` is `max(0, x - 1)`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of 0 and `x-1`, where `x` is the first element in the list `cnt`. The values of `n`, `a`, `cnt`, and `x` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs.
