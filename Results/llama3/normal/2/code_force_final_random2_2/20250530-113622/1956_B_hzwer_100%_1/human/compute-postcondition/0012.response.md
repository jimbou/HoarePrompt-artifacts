Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in the original list `a` and must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in the list `cnt`, `ans` is `max(0, x - 1)`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of 0 and `x - 1`, where `x` is the first element in the list `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
