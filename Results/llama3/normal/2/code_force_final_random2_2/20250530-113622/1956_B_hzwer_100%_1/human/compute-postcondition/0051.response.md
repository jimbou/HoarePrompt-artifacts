The only object in the loop head is variable `x` and list `cnt`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cnt`.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` has at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in the list `cnt`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the `x` is the second element in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `x` is the second element in the list `cnt`, `ans` is `max(0, x - 1)` more than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**
