Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `x` is the last element in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been initialized to 0, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
