The code `input = sys.stdin.readline` assigns the `readline` method of `sys.stdin` to the `input` variable. This means that `input` will now read input from standard input one line at a time, instead of reading the entire input at once.

Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a positive integer n. The second line contains n positive integers. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and input reads from standard input one line at a time.**
