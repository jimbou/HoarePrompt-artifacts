The only variable in the loop head is `x` and `cnt`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cnt`. If `cnt` has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `x` is the last element in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. So for the loop to be executed  the list `cnt` must have at least 1 element and the `x` is the first element in the list `cnt`.
State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `x` is the first element in the list `cnt`, `ans` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**
