Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a` and 0 for all other `x`, `x` is the last element in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been reset to 0, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains `n` integers, and the list `cnt` still keeps track of the occurrences of each integer in `a`. The variable `x` is still the last element in the list `a`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs.
