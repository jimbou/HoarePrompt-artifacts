Output State: **`n` is at least 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a` and 0 for all other `x`, `x` is the last element in the list `cnt`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, cnt[i] - 1)` for all `i` in the list `cnt`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `ans` will be the sum of the maximum of 0 and the count of each element in the list `cnt` minus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
