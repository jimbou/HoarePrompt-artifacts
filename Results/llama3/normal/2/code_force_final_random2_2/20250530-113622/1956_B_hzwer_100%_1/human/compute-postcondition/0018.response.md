The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`. Since `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in the original list `a` and is empty, `x` is the last element in the list `cnt`. Therefore, `x` is equal to `n`. 

The `max(0, x - 1)` expression evaluates to `n - 1` because `n` is a positive integer. 

So, `ans` is the sum of `n - 1` for all `x` in `cnt`. Since `cnt` has `n+1` elements, the sum is `(n - 1) * (n + 1)`.

Output: **(n - 1) * (n + 1)**
