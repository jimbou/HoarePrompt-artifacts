The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n followed by n positive integers. It then calculates and prints the sum of the counts of each integer minus one, effectively counting the number of pairs of identical integers in each test case. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input stream empty and does not print anything further.
