Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 elements, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is 2 and the rest are 0, `x` is the second element in the list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[x]` has been updated to 2, as it was incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, with `n` still being a positive integer, `a` still being a list of `n` integers with at least 2 elements, and `x` still being the second element in the list `a`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
