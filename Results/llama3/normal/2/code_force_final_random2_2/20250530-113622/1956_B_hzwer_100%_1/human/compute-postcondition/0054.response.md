Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `x` is the third element in the list `cnt`, `ans` is `max(0, x - 1)` more than `2 * max(0, x - 1)`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been increased by the maximum of 0 and `x-1`, where `x` is the third element in the list `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now twice the maximum of 0 and `x-1`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
