To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `x` and the list `cnt`. The loop will execute if `cnt` has at least one element. Since `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 0 to ensure `cnt` has at least one element. Additionally, `x` will take on the value of the first element in `cnt` at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is at least 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a` and 0 for all other `x`, `x` is the first element in the list `cnt`, `ans` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs**
