The code prints the sum of `max(0, cnt[i] - 1)` for all `i` in the list `cnt`. Here, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a` and 0 for all other `x`. The `max(0, cnt[i] - 1)` expression calculates the maximum value between 0 and `cnt[i] - 1`. This means that for each unique element `x` in `a`, the expression will contribute `cnt[x] - 1` to the sum if `cnt[x]` is greater than 1, and 0 otherwise.

Since `ans` is the sum of these values for all `i` in `cnt`, it represents the total number of occurrences of all unique elements in `a`, minus the number of unique elements.

Output: **The total number of occurrences of all unique elements in list a, minus the number of unique elements**
