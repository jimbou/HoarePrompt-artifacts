Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 integers, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is 2 and `cnt[y]` is 0 for all `y != x`, `x` is the second element in the list `a`, `ans` is not defined, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[x]` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains `n` integers, and `x` is still the second element in the list `a`. The variable `ans` is still not defined. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
