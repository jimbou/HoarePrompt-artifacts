Output State: **`n` is at least 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a` and 0 for all other `x`, `x` is the third element in the list `cnt`, `ans` is 3 * max(0, x - 1), stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to 3 times the maximum of 0 and `x - 1`, where `x` is the third element in the list `cnt`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
