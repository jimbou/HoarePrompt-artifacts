Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in the original list `a`, `x` is the last element in the original list `a`, `ans` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains a positive integer, the list `a` is still empty, the list `cnt` still contains `n+1` integers representing the occurrences of each element in the original list `a`, the value of `x` remains the last element in the original list `a`, and a new variable `ans` is introduced with a value of 0. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
