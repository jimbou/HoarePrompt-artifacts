The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the sum of `max(0, cnt[x] - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`. Here, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in the list `a`. The `max(0, cnt[x] - 1)` expression calculates the maximum between 0 and the number of occurrences of `x` minus 1. This effectively counts the number of occurrences of each number in `a`, minus 1, and sums them up.

Since the exact values of `a` and `cnt` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated sum.

Output: **sum of (number of occurrences of each number in a minus 1) for all numbers in a**
