The code prints the value of `ans` which is the sum of `max(0, cnt[x] - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`. This sum represents the total number of occurrences of each number in the list `a`, minus one for each number, summed up. In other words, it's the total count of all numbers in the list `a`, minus the number of unique numbers in the list.

Output: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `x` is the last element in the list `cnt`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, cnt[x] - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the sum of `max(0, cnt[x] - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt` is being printed**
