Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the number of cards in each test case, and the integers on the cards.

2. It initializes a count array `cnt` of size `n + 1` to keep track of the frequency of each integer from 1 to `n`.

3. It then iterates over the integers on the cards and increments the corresponding count in the `cnt` array.

4. Finally, it calculates the answer by summing up the counts of each integer minus one. This effectively counts the number of pairs of identical integers, which is the maximum number of points the player can get.

5. The program prints the answer for each test case.

The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected, reading multiple test cases, calculating the sum of the counts of each integer minus one, and printing the result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
