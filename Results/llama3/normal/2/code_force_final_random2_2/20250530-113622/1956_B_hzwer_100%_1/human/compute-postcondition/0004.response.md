The value of `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1. The value of `x` is the first element in the list `a`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `x` is the first element in the list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
