The only variable in the loop head is variable  x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cnt`. If `cnt` has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` has at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in the list `cnt`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list `cnt` must have at least 2 elements and the `x` is the second element in the list `cnt`.
State: **`n` is at least 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a` and 0 for all other `x`, `x` is the second element in the list `cnt`, `ans` is `max(0, x - 1)`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs**
