Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 elements, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is 2 for the second element in the list `a` and `cnt[y]` is 1 for the first element in the list `a` and 0 for all other `y`, `x` is the second element in the list `a`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, y - 1)` for all `y` in `cnt` which is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[x]` has been incremented by 1, where `x` is the second element in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `cnt[x]` is 1 for the first element in the list `a` and 0 for all other `x` is still valid, but now `cnt[x]` is 2 for the second element in the list `a`. The value of `ans` is still 0, as the sum of `max(0, y - 1)` for all `y` in `cnt` has not changed. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
