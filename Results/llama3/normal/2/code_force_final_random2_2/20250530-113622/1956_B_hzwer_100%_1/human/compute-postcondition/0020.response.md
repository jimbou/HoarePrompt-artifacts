The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and the input from stdin. If stdin contains at least one more test case, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. So for the loop to be executed one more time stdin must contain at least one more test case minus 2 inputs.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in the original list `a` and is empty, `x` is the last element in the list `cnt`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs, and the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt` which is equal to `ans` is being printed**
