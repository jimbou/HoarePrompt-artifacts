Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 3 elements, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is 3 and the rest are 0, `x` is the third element in the list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[x]` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still has `n` integers, and `x` is still the third element in the list `a`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
