Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is an empty list, cnt is a list of n+1 integers where cnt[x] is the number of occurrences of x in the original list a, x is the last element in the original list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the list `a` will be empty because the loop iterates over all elements in `a`. The list `cnt` will contain the count of each integer in the original list `a`, where `cnt[x]` represents the number of times `x` appeared in `a`. The variable `x` will hold the last element that was processed in the loop, which is the last element in the original list `a`. The state of `n` and `stdin` remains unchanged.
