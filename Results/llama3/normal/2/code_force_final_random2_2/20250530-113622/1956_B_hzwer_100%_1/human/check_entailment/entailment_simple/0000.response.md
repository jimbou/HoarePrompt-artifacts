Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player.

Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the cards in the player's hand `a`.
3. It initializes a count array `cnt` of size `n+1` to keep track of the frequency of each card value.
4. It iterates over the cards in the player's hand and increments the corresponding count in the `cnt` array.
5. It initializes a variable `ans` to 0 to store the maximum number of points that can be scored.
6. It iterates over the `cnt` array and for each count, it adds the maximum of 0 and the count minus 1 to `ans`. This is because if a card value appears more than once in the player's hand, the player can score points by playing the second occurrence of that card value.
7. Finally, it prints the maximum number of points that can be scored, which is stored in `ans`.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player, and it handles all the edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
