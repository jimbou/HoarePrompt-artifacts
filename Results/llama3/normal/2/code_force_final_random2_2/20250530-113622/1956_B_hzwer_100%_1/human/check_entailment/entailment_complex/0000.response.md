Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of points a player can score in a card game. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n followed by n positive integers. It then calculates and prints the sum of the counts of each integer minus one, effectively counting the number of pairs of identical integers in each test case.

The program's logic is correct because it accurately implements the strategy for maximizing the player's score. By counting the number of pairs of identical integers, the program is essentially identifying the opportunities for the player to score points. The player can score a point for each pair of identical integers, as they can play one of the integers and then play the other integer to score a point.

The program's implementation is also correct. It uses a list `cnt` to count the occurrences of each integer, and then iterates over the list to calculate the sum of the counts minus one. This is an efficient and accurate way to calculate the number of pairs of identical integers.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
