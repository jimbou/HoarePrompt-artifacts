Output: **`n` is at least 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a` and 0 for all other `x`, `x` is the last element in the list `cnt`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, cnt[i] - 1)` for all `i` in the list `cnt`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs, and the sum of `max(0, cnt[i] - 1)` for all `i` in the list `cnt` is being printed**
