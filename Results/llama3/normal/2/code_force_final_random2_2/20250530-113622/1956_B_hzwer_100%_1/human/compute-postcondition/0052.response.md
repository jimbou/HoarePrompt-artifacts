Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `x` is the second element in the list `cnt`, `ans` is `max(0, x - 1)` more than `max(0, x - 1)`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been increased by `max(0, x - 1)`, where `x` is the second element in the list `cnt`. The values of `n`, `a`, `cnt`, and `x` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin has not changed, but two inputs have been consumed.
