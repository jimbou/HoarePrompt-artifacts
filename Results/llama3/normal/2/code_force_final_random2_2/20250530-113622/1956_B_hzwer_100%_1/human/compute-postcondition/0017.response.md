Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in the original list `a` and is empty, `x` is the last element in the list `cnt`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the list `cnt` is empty, and the variable `ans` holds the sum of the maximum of 0 and the difference between each element in the original list `cnt` and 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
