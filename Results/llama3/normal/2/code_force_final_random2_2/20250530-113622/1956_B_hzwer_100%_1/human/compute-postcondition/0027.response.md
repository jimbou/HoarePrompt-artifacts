Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 3 elements, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is 4 for the third element in the list `a` and `cnt[y]` is 2 for the second element in the list `a` and `cnt[z]` is 1 for the first element in the list `a` and 0 for all other `z`, `x` is the third element in the list `a`, `ans` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[x]` has been incremented by 1, where `x` is the third element in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `cnt` now has a value of 4 for the third element in the list `a`, and the other values remain the same. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.
