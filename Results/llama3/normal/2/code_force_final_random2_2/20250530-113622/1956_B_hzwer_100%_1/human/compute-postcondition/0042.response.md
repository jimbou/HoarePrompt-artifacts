Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, `cnt` is a list of n+1 integers where cnt[x] is 1 and cnt[y] is 0 for all y != x, `x` is the first element in the list `a`, `ans` is not defined, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**

The code increments the value of `cnt[x]` by 1, where `x` is the first element in the list `a`. Since `cnt[x]` was initially 0, its new value is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The state of `cnt[y]` for all `y` not equal to `x` remains 0.
