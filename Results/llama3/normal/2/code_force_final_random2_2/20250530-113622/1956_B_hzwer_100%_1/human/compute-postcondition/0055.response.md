Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `x` is the last element in the list `cnt`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, cnt[x] - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will be the same as the initial state, except that `x` will be the last element in the list `cnt`, and `ans` will be the sum of `max(0, cnt[x] - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`. This means that `ans` will be the total count of all elements in `a` that appear more than once, minus the number of unique elements in `a`.
