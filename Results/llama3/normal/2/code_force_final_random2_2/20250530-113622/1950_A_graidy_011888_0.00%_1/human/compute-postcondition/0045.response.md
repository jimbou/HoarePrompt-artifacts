Output: **i is less than or equal to 1000, x is an integer between 1 and 9, y is an integer between 1 and 9, z is an integer between 1 and 9, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If x < y, then if y > z, res is 'peak', if y < z, res is 'stair', if y equals z, res is 'none'. If x is not less than y, then res is 'none'. The value of res is printed. and the values of x, y, z are printed, separated by spaces**
