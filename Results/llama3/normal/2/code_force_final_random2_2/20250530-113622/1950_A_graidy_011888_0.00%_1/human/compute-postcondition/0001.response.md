The only variable in the loop head is variable i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i. If i is less than or equal to 1000, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, i is 1, which is less than 1000, so the loop can certainly execute one time. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 1, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9)**
