Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, `res` is 'none', stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). The current value of x is less than the current value of y. y is equal to z**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `i`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged, and `res` is now set to the string 'none'. The input in stdin remains the same, with an integer t followed by t lines of three digits each. The relationship between `x`, `y`, and `z` also remains the same, with `x` being less than `y` and `y` being equal to `z`.
