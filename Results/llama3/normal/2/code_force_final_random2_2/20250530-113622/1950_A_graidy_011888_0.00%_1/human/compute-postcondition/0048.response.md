Output State: **`i` is less than or equal to 1001, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If x < y, then if y > z, res is 'peak', if y < z, res is 'stair', if y equals z, res is 'none'. If x is not less than y, then res is 'none'. The value of res is printed. and the values of x, y, z are printed, separated by spaces**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
