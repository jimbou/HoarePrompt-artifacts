Output State: **`i` is 1001, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If x < y, then if y > z, res is 'peak'. If y is less than z, then res is 'stair', otherwise res is 'none'. If x is not less than y, then res is 'none'. The value of res is printed. and the values of x, y, z are printed, separated by spaces.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be 1001, and the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` will be integers between 1 and 9. The value of `res` will be determined based on the conditions in the loop, and it will be printed along with the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`. The state of the other variables in the precondition, such as `t` and the lines in `stdin`, will remain unchanged.
