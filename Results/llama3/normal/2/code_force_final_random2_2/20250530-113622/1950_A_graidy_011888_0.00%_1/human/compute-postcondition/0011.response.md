Postcondition: ***i is 1, x is an integer between 1 and 9, y is an integer between 1 and 9, z is an integer between 1 and 9, res is a string, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). The current value of x is less than the current value of y. If y is less than z, res is 'stair'. If y is equal to z, res is 'none'.***
