The variable in the loop head is variable i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i.  If i is less than or equal to 1000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 2, So for the loop to be executed one more time i must be less than or equal to 1000.
State: **`i` is less than or equal to 1000, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If x is less than y, then if y is greater than z, res is 'peak'. If y is less than z, res is 'stair'. If y is equal to z, res is 'none'. If x is not less than y, then res is 'none', and this is printed: x, y, z, where x is an integer between 1 and 9, y is an integer between 1 and 9, and z is an integer between 1 and 9, and res is printed**
