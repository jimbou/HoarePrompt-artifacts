Output: **i is 1, x is an integer between 1 and 9, y is an integer between 1 and 9, z is an integer between 1 and 9, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If x is less than y, then if y is greater than z, res is 'peak'. If y is less than z, res is 'stair'. If y is equal to z, res is 'none'. If x is not less than y, then res is 'none', and this is printed: x, y, z, where x is an integer between 1 and 9, y is an integer between 1 and 9, and z is an integer between 1 and 9**
