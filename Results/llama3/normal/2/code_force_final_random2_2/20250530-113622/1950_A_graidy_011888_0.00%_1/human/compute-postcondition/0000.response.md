Output State: **`i` is 1, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9).**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been set to 1. The stdin still contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9), as the code does not affect the input.
