Functionality: **This function generates and prints 1000 sets of three random digits between 1 and 9, along with a classification of the sequence as 'peak', 'stair', or 'none' based on the relative values of the digits. The classification is determined by the following rules: if the second digit is greater than the first and third digits, the sequence is classified as 'peak'; if the second digit is greater than the first but less than the third, the sequence is classified as 'stair'; otherwise, the sequence is classified as 'none'. The function does not accept any input parameters and does not return any values, but instead prints the generated sequences and classifications to the console.**
