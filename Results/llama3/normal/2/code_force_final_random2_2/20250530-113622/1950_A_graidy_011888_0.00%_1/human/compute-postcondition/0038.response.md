Output State: **`i` is less than or equal to 1000, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9), `res` is 'stair' and the value of `res` is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `i`, `x`, `y`, `z`, and stdin remain unchanged from the initial state. The only change is that the value of `res` is now 'stair', and this value is printed.
