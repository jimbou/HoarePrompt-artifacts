Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, `res` is 'peak', stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). The current value of x is less than the current value of y. The current value of y is greater than the current value of z**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to 'peak', while the values of `i`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains the same input as before, and the relationships between `x`, `y`, and `z` are still valid.
