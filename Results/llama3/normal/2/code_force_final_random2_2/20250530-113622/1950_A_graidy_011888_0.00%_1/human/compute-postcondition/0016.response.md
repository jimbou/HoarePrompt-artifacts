Based on the precondition, we know that `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers between 1 and 9. The `print` statement uses the `sep=' '` argument, which means that the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` will be printed separated by a space.

Since the exact values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are not specified, we cannot determine their exact values. However, we can describe their values based on the given information.

`x` is an integer between 1 and 9, so its value can be any integer in this range.

`y` is also an integer between 1 and 9, so its value can be any integer in this range.

`z` is an integer between 1 and 9, so its value can be any integer in this range.

The `print` statement will print the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`, separated by spaces.

Output: **[x] [y] [z] (where x, y, and z are integers between 1 and 9)**
