Postcondition: ***i is less than or equal to 1000, x is an integer between 1 and 9, y is an integer between 1 and 9, z is an integer between 1 and 9, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If y > z, then res is 'peak' and the value of res is printed. If y < z, then res is 'stair' and the value of res is printed. If y equals z, then res is 'none'.***
