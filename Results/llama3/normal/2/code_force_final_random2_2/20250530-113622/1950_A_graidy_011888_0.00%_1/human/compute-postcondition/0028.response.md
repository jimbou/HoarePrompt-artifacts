Output State: **`i` is less than or equal to 1000, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, `res` is 'none', stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9)**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to 'none', while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains the same input as before, with an integer t followed by t lines of three digits each.
