Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `res` is 'none', stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9), x is not less than y**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to 'none', while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains the same input as before, and the relationship between `x` and `y` remains unchanged.
