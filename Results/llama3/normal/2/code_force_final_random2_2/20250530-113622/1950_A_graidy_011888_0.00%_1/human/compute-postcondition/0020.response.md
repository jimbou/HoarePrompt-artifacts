Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If x is less than y, then if y is greater than z, res is 'peak'. If y is less than z, res is 'stair'. If y is equal to z, res is 'none'. If x is not less than y, then res is 'none', and this is printed: x, y, z, where x is an integer between 1 and 9, y is an integer between 1 and 9, and z is an integer between 1 and 9, and res is printed**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The values of `x`, `y`, `z`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged. The conditions for `res` also remain the same, depending on the relative values of `x`, `y`, and `z`.
