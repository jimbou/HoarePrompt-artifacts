Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, `res` is 'stair', stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). The current value of x is less than the current value of y. The current value of y is less than the current value of z.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to 'stair', while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains the input data, and the relationships between the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are still valid.
