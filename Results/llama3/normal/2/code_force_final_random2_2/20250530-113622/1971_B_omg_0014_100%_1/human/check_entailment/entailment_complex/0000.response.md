Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads a string `s` and creates a set `a` containing the unique characters in `s`.
3. If the set `a` contains only one unique character, it prints 'NO', which is correct because it's impossible to rearrange the characters to form a new string that is not equal to `s`.
4. If the set `a` contains more than one unique character, it prints 'YES' and then checks if the original string `s` is equal to the string `b` containing the characters of `s` in ascending order.
5. If `s` is equal to `b`, it prints the string `c` containing the characters of `s` in descending order. This is correct because `c` is a rearrangement of `s` that is not equal to `s`.
6. If `s` is not equal to `b`, it prints the string `b` containing the characters of `s` in ascending order. This is correct because `b` is a rearrangement of `s` that is not equal to `s`.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
