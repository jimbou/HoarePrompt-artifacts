Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, i is 0, s is a string of length n, a is a set containing the unique characters in s, b is a string of the same length n containing the characters of s in ascending order, c is a string of the same length n containing the characters of s in descending order. If the characters in s are in ascending order, the string c which contains the characters of s in descending order is being printed. Otherwise, the string b (which is the string s with its characters in ascending order) is being printed.***
