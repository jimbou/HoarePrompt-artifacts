Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains n strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. i is n-1, s is a string of length n, a is a set containing the unique characters in s, b is a string containing the characters of s in ascending order, and c is a string containing the characters of s in descending order. If the set a contains only one unique character, 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is being printed. If the string s is equal to the string b containing the characters of s in ascending order, then the string c containing the characters of s in descending order is being printed. Otherwise, the string b containing the characters of s in ascending order is being printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be one less than the initial value of `n`, and the variables `s`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the values corresponding to the last string read from stdin. The output will be either 'NO' if the last string contains only one unique character, or 'YES' followed by the sorted string in ascending or descending order, depending on whether the original string was already sorted in ascending order.
