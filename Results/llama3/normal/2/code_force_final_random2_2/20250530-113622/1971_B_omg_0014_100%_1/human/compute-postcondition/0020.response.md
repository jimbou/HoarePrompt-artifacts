Based on the initial state, the variables and objects are defined as follows:

* `n` is an integer greater than 1.
* `i` is an integer equal to 1.
* `s` is a string of length `n`.
* `a` is a set containing the unique characters in string `s`.

The print statement is simply `print('NO')`, which prints the string 'NO' without any variables or expressions.

Therefore, the output will be the string 'NO' itself, without any substitution or calculation.

Output: **NO**
