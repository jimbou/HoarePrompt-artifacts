Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to check if a string can be rearranged to form a new string that is not equal to the original string. If the string contains all unique characters (i.e., the length of the set of characters is 1), it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and the rearranged string. The rearranged string is either the sorted string in ascending order or descending order, depending on whether the original string was already sorted in ascending order. This ensures that the rearranged string is not equal to the original string.

Correctness: **True**
