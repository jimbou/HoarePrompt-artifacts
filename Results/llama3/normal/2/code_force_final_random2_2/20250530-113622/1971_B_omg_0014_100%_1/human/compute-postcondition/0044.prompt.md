Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains n strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    s = input()
    a = set(s)
    if len(a) == 1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        b = ''.join(sorted(s))
        c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
        if b == s:
            print(c)
        else:
            print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is greater than 0, i is 0, s is a string of length n, a is a set containing the unique characters in s. If the set a contains only one unique character, 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, b is a string of the same length n containing the characters of s in ascending order, c is a string of the same length n containing the characters of s in descending order. If the characters in s are in ascending order, the string c which contains the characters of s in descending order is being printed. Otherwise, the string b (which is the string s with its characters in ascending order) is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is greater than 1, i is 1, s is a string of length n, a is a set containing the unique characters in s. If the length of set a is 1, then 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is being printed, b is a string containing the characters of s in ascending order, and c is a string containing the characters of s in descending order. If the string s is equal to the string b containing the characters of s in ascending order, then the string c containing the characters of s in descending order is being printed. Otherwise, the string b containing the characters of s in ascending order is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is greater than 2, i is 2, s is a string of length n, a is a set containing the unique characters in s, b is a string containing the characters of s in ascending order, and c is a string containing the characters of s in descending order. If the set a contains only one unique character, 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is being printed. If the string s is equal to the string b containing the characters of s in ascending order, then the string c containing the characters of s in descending order is being printed. Otherwise, the string b containing the characters of s in ascending order is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
