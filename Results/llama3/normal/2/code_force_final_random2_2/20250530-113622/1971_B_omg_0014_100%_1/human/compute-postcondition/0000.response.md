Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains n strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The stdin now contains n strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. The other information from the precondition is still valid after the code has been executed.
