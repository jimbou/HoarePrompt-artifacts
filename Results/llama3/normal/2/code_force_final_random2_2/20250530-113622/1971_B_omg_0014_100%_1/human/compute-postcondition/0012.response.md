Output: **n is greater than 0, i is 0, s is a string of length n, a is a set containing the unique characters in s, b is a string of the same length n containing the characters of s in ascending order, c is a string of the same length n containing the characters of s in descending order. The current value of b is equal to the current value of s, meaning the characters in s are in ascending order, and the string c which contains the characters of s in descending order is being printed**
