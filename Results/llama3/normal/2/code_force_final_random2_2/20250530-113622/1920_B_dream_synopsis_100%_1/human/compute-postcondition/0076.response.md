Postcondition: ***`n`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `_`, `k`, `i`, `ans` are as described in the precondition. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, then `sums` is the updated sum after adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` plus the integer at index `i - 1` in `a`.***
