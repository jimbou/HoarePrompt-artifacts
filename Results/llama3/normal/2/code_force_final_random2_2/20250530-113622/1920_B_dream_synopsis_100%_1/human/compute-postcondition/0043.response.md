Postcondition: ***n is an integer, k is at least 0, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is a list containing the cumulative sum, _ is k, the maximum cumulative sum is being printed. If i is 1, ans contains the value of sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]). If i is not equal to 1, ans contains the updated cumulative sum if i + x - 1 is less than n, otherwise ans contains the cumulative sum of the integers in a up to index i-1. If i + x - 1 is less than n, sums is the cumulative sum of the integers in a up to index i-1 plus a[i - 1] minus 2 times a[i + x - 1]. Otherwise, sums is the cumulative sum of the integers in a up to index i.***
