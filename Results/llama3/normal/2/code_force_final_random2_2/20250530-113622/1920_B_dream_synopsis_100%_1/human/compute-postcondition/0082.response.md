Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: the number of elements, a threshold value, and a selection size. The second line contains a list of integers. The function sorts the list in descending order, calculates the sum of the integers, and then iterates over a range of values from 0 to the threshold value. For each iteration, it calculates an updated sum by subtracting twice the value of the selected integers or adding the previous integer if the selection size exceeds the list length. The function stores these updated sums in a list and finally prints the maximum value from this list. The function repeats this process for all test cases.**
