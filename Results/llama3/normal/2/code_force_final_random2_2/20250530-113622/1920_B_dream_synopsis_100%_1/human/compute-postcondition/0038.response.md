Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the cumulative sum, `_` is `k-1`, the maximum cumulative sum is being printed. If `i` is 0, `ans` contains the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `ans` contains the updated cumulative sum if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans` contains the cumulative sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i-1`.***
