Output State: **n is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, _ is k + 1, k is at least 2, i is 2, ans is a list containing the updated sums, sums is the sum of the integers in a plus the integer at index i - 1 in a.**

The code adds the integer at index `i - 1` in list `a` to `sums` and appends the updated `sums` to list `ans`. Since `i` is 2, the integer at index `i - 1` is the second integer in `a`. The value of `sums` is updated to include this additional integer, and the updated `sums` is added to `ans`. No other variables are affected.
