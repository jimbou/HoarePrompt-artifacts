The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the input, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is k. For the loop to execute again _ must be k + 1.
State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is a list containing the cumulative sum, _ is k + 1, the maximum cumulative sum is being printed.**
