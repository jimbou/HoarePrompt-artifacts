To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is at least 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `ans` is an empty list, and `_` is `k + 1`. These states do not guarantee that the loop will execute, so we need to adjust `k` to be at least 0 and `i` to be 0.

State: **`n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `_` is `k + 1`, `k` is at least 0, `i` is 0**
