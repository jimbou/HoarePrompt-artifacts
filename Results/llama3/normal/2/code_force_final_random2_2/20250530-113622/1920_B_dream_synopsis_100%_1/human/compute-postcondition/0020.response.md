Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, i is 2, sums is sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1], ans is a list containing the value of sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1].**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `sum1` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]` from its previous value, which was `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. The list `ans` now contains the updated value of `sums`.
