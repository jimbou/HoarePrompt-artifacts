Output State: **n is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is a list containing the updated sums, _ is k + 1, k is at least 0, i is not equal to 0, and the current value of i + x - 1 is less than n.**

In this output state, the value of `sums` has been updated by adding the difference between the integer at index `i - 1` in list `a` and twice the integer at index `i + x - 1` in list `a`. This updated value of `sums` has been appended to the list `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
