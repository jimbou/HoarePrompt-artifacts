Output State: **n is an integer, k is at least 0, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is a list containing the updated cumulative sum, _ is k-1, the maximum cumulative sum is being printed, i is not equal to 0, and the current value of i + x - 1 is less than n, sums is the updated cumulative sum.**

In this output state, the value of `sums` has been updated by adding the difference between the current element at index `i-1` in list `a` and twice the element at index `i+x-1` in list `a`. This updated value of `sums` has been appended to the list `ans`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
