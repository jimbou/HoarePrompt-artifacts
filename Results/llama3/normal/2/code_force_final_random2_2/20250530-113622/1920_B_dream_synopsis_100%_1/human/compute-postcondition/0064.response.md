Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the updated sums if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans` is a list containing the sum of the integers in `a` plus `a[i - 1]`, `_` is `k + 1`, `k` is at least 0, and `i` is not equal to 0.***
