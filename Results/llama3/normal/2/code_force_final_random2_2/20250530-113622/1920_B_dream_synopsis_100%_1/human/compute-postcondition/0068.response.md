Output State: **n is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, _ is k + 1, k is at least 1, i is 1, ans is a list containing the updated sums if i + x - 1 is less than n, otherwise ans is a list containing the sum of the integers in a plus a[i - 1], sums is the updated sum after adding a[i - 1] and subtracting 2 times a[i + x - 1].**

The code updates the value of `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`. This new value of `sums` is then appended to the list `ans`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. The value of `x` also remains unchanged. The list `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `sum1` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `_` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
