Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `x` are integers, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`. `i` is increased by 1. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums + a[i - 1]`.***
