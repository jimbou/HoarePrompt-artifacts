To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `k + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `k` is at least 1, it must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables in the state, such as `n`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `_`, and `ans`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `_` is `k + 1`, `k` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the updated sums.**
