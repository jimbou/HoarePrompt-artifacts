Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is an empty list, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` if `i` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, where `sums` is the value of `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`, then `ans` is a list containing the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `k`, `x` are integers, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`. If `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums + a[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `k`, `x` are integers, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`. `i` is 2. If `i` was originally 0, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[i - 1]`. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
