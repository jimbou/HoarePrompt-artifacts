Output State: **n is an integer, k is greater than i, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is a list containing the cumulative sum, _ is k, the maximum cumulative sum is being printed. If i is 0, ans contains the value of sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]). If i is not equal to 0, if i + x - 1 is less than n, ans contains the cumulative sum of the integers in a up to index i-1 plus a[i - 1] minus 2 times a[i + x - 1]. Otherwise, ans contains the cumulative sum of the integers in a up to index i. If i is 1, ans contains the value of sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]). If i is not equal to 1, ans contains the updated cumulative sum if i + x - 1 is less than n, otherwise ans contains the cumulative sum of the integers in a up to index i-1.**

The code adds the value of `a[i - 1]` to `sums` and appends the updated `sums` to the list `ans`. This operation affects the value of `ans` by adding a new element to the list. The value of `sums` is also updated by adding `a[i - 1]` to it. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
