Postcondition: ***`n`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `_`, `k`, `i`, `ans` are as described in the precondition. If `i` is 0, then `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`. If `i` is not 0, then if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is the updated sum after adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` plus the integer at index `i - 1` in `a`.***
