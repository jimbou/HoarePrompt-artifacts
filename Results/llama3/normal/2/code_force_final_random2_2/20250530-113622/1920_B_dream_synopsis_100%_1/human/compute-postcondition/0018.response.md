The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k + 1`. So, `i` is increased by 1.
State: **`n`, `k`, `x` are integers, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`. If `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums + a[i - 1]`. `i` is 1**
