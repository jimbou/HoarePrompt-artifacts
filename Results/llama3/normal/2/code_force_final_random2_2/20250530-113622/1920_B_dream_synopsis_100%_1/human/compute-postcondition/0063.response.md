Output State: **n is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is a list containing the sum of the integers in a plus a[i - 1], _ is k + 1, k is at least 0, i is not equal to 0, and i + x - 1 is greater than or equal to n, sums is the sum of the integers in a plus a[i - 1].**

The code block modifies the `ans` list by appending the value of `sums + a[i - 1]` to it. Since `sums` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it is a variable that holds the sum of the integers in list `a`. The value of `sums` is updated by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` to it. The updated value of `sums` is then appended to the `ans` list. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
