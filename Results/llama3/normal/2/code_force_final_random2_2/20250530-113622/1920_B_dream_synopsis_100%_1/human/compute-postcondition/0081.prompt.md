Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers t, k, and x (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ k,x ≤ n). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    a.reverse()
    sum1 = sum(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(k + 1):
        if i == 0:
            sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])
            ans.append(sums)
        elif i + x - 1 < n:
            sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
            ans.append(sums)
        else:
            sums = sums + a[i - 1]
            ans.append(sums)
    print(max(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `k`, `x` are integers, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the integers in `a` with a sliding window of size `x` applied to the list, `_` is `k`, and the maximum cumulative sum which is the maximum value in the `ans` list is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is a list containing the cumulative sum, _ is k, the maximum cumulative sum is being printed. If i is 0, ans contains the value of sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]). If i is not equal to 0, if i + x - 1 is less than n, ans contains the cumulative sum of the integers in a up to index i-1 plus a[i - 1] minus 2 times a[i + x - 1]. Otherwise, ans contains the cumulative sum of the integers in a up to index i, and the maximum cumulative sum is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `_` is `k + 1`, `k` is at least 0, `i` is `k`, `ans` is a list containing the updated sums. If `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `ans` is a list containing the updated sums if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans` is a list containing the sum of the integers in `a` plus `a[i - 1]`, and the maximum value of the list `ans` is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
