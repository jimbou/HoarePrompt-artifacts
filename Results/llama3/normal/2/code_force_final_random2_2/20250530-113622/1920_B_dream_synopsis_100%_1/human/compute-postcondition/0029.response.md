To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is at least 0, the loop can execute. Since the loop iterates `k + 1` times, we can adjust the state of `k` to be at least 0. Additionally, we can set the initial value of `i` to 0, as it will be the first value in the range.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `_` is `k-1`, the maximum cumulative sum is being printed, `i` is 0**
