Output: **`n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `_` is `k + 1`, `k` is at least 0, `i` is `k`, `ans` is a list containing the updated sums. If `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `ans` is a list containing the updated sums if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans` is a list containing the sum of the integers in `a` plus `a[i - 1]`, and the maximum value of the list `ans` is printed**
