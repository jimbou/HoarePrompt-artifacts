The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is at least 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be at least 1.
State: **`n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `_` is `k + 1`, `k` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the updated sums if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans` is a list containing the sum of the integers in `a` plus `a[i - 1]`.**
