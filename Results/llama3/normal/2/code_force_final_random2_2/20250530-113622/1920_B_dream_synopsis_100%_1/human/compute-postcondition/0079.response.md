The `print(max(ans))` statement will print the maximum value in the `ans` list.

The `ans` list contains the updated sums based on the value of `i`. If `i` is 0, `ans` contains the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `ans` contains the updated sums if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans` contains the sum of the integers in `a` plus `a[i - 1]`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `k`, and `i` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `max(ans)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the maximum value in the `ans` list.

Output: **the maximum value in the ans list (which is the maximum of the updated sums based on the value of i)**
