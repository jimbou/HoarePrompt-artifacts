Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, i is 2, sums is sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[i - 1], ans is a list containing the value of sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[i - 1].**

The code modifies the values of `i`, `sums`, and `ans`. The value of `i` is increased by 1, making it 2. The value of `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` to it, which is equivalent to adding the first element of the list `a` to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. The value of `ans` is updated by appending the new value of `sums` to it, making it a list containing the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[i - 1]`. The values of `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `sum1` remain unchanged.
