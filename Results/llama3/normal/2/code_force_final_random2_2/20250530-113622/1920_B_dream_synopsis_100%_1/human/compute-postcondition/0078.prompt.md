Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is an empty list, _ is k + 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `_` is `k + 1`, `k` is at least 0. If `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `ans` is a list containing the updated sums if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans` is a list containing the sum of the integers in `a` plus `a[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `_` is `k + 1`, `k` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the updated sums. If `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the updated sums if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans` is a list containing the sum of the integers in `a` plus `a[i - 1]` and the updated sums. If `i` is not 0, `ans` is a list containing the updated sums. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is the updated sum after adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting 2 times `a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` plus `a[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `_`, `k`, `i`, `ans` are as described in the precondition. If `i` is 0, then `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`. If `i` is not 0, then if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is the updated sum after adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` plus the integer at index `i - 1` in `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
