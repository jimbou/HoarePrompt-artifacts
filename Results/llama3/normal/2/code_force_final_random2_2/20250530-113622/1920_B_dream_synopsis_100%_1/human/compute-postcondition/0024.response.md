Output State: **`n`, `k`, `x` are integers, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the integers in `a` with a sliding window of size `x` applied to the list, `_` is `k`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the list `ans` will contain the cumulative sums of the integers in list `a` with a sliding window of size `x` applied to the list. The sliding window starts from the beginning of the list and moves to the right, and at each position, the sum of the integers within the window is calculated and appended to the list `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.
