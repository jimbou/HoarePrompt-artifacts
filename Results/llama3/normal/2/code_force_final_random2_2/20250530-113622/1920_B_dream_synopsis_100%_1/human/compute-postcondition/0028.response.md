Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is an empty list, _ is k-1, and the maximum cumulative sum is being printed**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers assigned from the input. The list `a` contains integers in descending order, and `sum1` is the sum of these integers. The list `ans` is empty, and `_` is equal to `k-1`. The maximum cumulative sum, which is the maximum value in the `ans` list, is being printed.
