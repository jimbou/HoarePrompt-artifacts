stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three integers n, k, and x, where n is the number of elements in the array, k is the limit on the number of elements that Alice can remove, and x is the limit on the number of elements that Bob can multiply by -1. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, which are the elements of the array. 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, k <= n, and 1 <= a_i <= 1000.
