The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, `k` is at least 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than the new value of `i`. 
State: **n is an integer, k is greater than i, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is a list containing the cumulative sum, _ is k, the maximum cumulative sum is being printed. If i is 0, ans contains the value of sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]). If i is not equal to 0, if i + x - 1 is less than n, ans contains the cumulative sum of the integers in a up to index i-1 plus a[i - 1] minus 2 times a[i + x - 1]. Otherwise, ans contains the cumulative sum of the integers in a up to index i. If i is 1, ans contains the value of sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]). If i is not equal to 1, ans contains the updated cumulative sum if i + x - 1 is less than n, otherwise ans contains the cumulative sum of the integers in a up to index i-1.**
