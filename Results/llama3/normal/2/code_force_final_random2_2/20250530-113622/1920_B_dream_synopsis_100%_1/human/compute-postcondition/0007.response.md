Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is a list containing the value of sums, _ is 0, i is not equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, sums is the value of sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1].**

The code snippet modifies the value of `sums` by adding the difference between the value at index `i - 1` in list `a` and twice the value at index `i + x - 1` in list `a`. This new value of `sums` is then appended to the list `ans`. No other variables are affected by the code. The value of `i + x - 1` is still less than `n`.
