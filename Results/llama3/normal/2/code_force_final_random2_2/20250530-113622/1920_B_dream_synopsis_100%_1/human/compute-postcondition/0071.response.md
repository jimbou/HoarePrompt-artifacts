Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `_` is `k + 1`, `k` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the updated sums. If `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the updated sums if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans` is a list containing the sum of the integers in `a` plus `a[i - 1]` and the updated sums. If `i` is not 0, `ans` is a list containing the updated sums. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is the updated sum after adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting 2 times `a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` plus `a[i - 1]`.***
