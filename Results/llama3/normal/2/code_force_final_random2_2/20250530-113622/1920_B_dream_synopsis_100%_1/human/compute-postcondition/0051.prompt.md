Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is an empty list, _ is k-1, and the maximum cumulative sum is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `k` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the cumulative sum, `_` is `k-1`, the maximum cumulative sum is being printed. If `i` is 0, `ans` contains the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `ans` contains the updated cumulative sum if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans` contains the cumulative sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer, k is at least 0, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is a list containing the cumulative sum, _ is k, the maximum cumulative sum is being printed. If i is 0, ans contains the value of sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]). If i is not equal to 0, if i + x - 1 is less than n, ans contains the cumulative sum of the integers in a up to index i-1 plus a[i - 1] minus 2 times a[i + x - 1]. Otherwise, ans contains the cumulative sum of the integers in a up to index i. If i is 1, ans contains the value of sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]). If i is not equal to 1, ans contains the updated cumulative sum if i + x - 1 is less than n, otherwise ans contains the cumulative sum of the integers in a up to index i-1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer, k is greater than i, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is a list containing the cumulative sum, _ is k, the maximum cumulative sum is being printed. If i is 0, ans contains the value of sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]). If i is not equal to 0, if i + x - 1 is less than n, ans contains the cumulative sum of the integers in a up to index i-1 plus a[i - 1] minus 2 times a[i + x - 1]. Otherwise, ans contains the cumulative sum of the integers in a up to index i. If i is 1, ans contains the value of sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]). If i is not equal to 1, ans contains the updated cumulative sum if i + x - 1 is less than n, otherwise ans contains the cumulative sum of the integers in a up to index i-1. If i + x - 1 is less than n, sums is the cumulative sum of the integers in a up to index i-1 plus a[i - 1] minus 2 times a[i + x - 1].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
