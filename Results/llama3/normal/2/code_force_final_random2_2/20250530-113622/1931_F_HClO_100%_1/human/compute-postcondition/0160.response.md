Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer greater than or equal to 2, n is an integer greater than 2, _ is at least m - 2, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, i is 2, val is an empty list, a3 is undefined, l3 is undefined. If l1[i + p1] equals a2, then p1 is 1, idx1 is 2, and p2 and idx2 remain unchanged. Otherwise, p2 is 1, idx2 is 2, and p1 and idx1 remain unchanged.***
