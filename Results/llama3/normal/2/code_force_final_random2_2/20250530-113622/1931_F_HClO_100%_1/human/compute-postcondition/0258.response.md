Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than 1, m is at least 2, _ is either 1 or a string, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, a3 is the first element of the last tuple in val, l11 is a list of integers with all occurrences of a2 removed from l1, l22 is a list of integers with all occurrences of a1 removed from l2, p1 is 1, p2 is 0, val contains at least m - 1 tuples, l3 is the second element of the last tuple in val, idx1 is i, idx2 is -1, stdin contains no input.**

The code modifies the values of `idx1` and `p1`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `idx1`, and the second line sets `p1` to 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
