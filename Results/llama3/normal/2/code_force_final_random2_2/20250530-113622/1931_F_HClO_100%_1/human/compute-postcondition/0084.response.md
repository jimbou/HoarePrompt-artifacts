Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at idx2, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is either 1 or 0, p2 is either 1 or 0, i is n - 1, val is an empty list, idx1 is not less than idx2 and idx1 is less than or equal to idx2, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, stdin contains no input, and l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at idx2.**

The code inserts `a1` at index `idx2` in the list `l1`, and then assigns the modified list `l1` to the variable `l`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
