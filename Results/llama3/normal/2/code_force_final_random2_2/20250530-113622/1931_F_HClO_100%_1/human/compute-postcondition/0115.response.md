To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the range object created by `range(t)`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer greater than 0. To execute the loop again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1.

Since `_` is the current value of `m - 2`, we can infer that `_` is an integer. Therefore, we can increment `_` by 1.

The state of `t` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables (`m`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `val`, `a3`, and `l3`) are not involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is the current value of `m - 1`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `i` is the current value of `n - 1`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined**
