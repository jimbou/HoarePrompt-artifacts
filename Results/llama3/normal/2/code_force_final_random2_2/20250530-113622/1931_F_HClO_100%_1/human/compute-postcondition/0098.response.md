The only objects in the loop head are variables  a3, l3, and list  val, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the val.  If the list has at least 1 tuple the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer greater than 0, _ is m - 2, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, m is an integer greater than or equal to 2, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is either 1 or 0, p2 is either 1 or 0, i is n - 1, stdin is empty. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 tuple and the a3 is the first a3 in the list and l3 is the first l3 in the list.
State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is m - 2, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, m is an integer greater than or equal to 2, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is either 1 or 0, p2 is either 1 or 0, i is n - 1, val is a list containing at least 1 tuple (a3, l3), a3 is the first a3 in the list, l3 is the first l3 in the list, stdin is empty**
