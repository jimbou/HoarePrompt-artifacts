Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer greater than or equal to 2, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, _ is at least m - 2, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is 0 or 1, p2 is 0 or 1, i is n - 1, val is an empty list, a3 is undefined, l3 is undefined, idx1 is not less than idx2, idx1 is greater than idx2, l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2.**

In this output state, the code has inserted the value of `a1` at index `idx2` in the list `l1`. The list `l` is now a reference to the modified list `l1`. All other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `idx1` and `idx2` is maintained, with `idx1` being greater than `idx2`.
