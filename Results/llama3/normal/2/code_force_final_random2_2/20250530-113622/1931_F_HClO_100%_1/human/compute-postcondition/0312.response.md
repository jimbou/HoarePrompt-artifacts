Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, m is at least 2, _ is either 1 or a string, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers with all occurrences of a2 removed from l1, l22 is a list of integers with all occurrences of a1 removed from l2, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is an empty list, i is n - 1, idx1 is not -1, idx2 is n - 2, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1.**

The code modifies the list `l2` by inserting the value of `a2` at the index `idx1`, and then assigns this modified list to the variable `l`. The index `idx1` is not -1, and `idx2` is updated to `n - 2` if `idx1` is not -1 and `idx2` is -1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
