Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is the current value of `m - 1`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `i` is the current value of `n - 1`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but the program skips to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves on to the next iteration.
