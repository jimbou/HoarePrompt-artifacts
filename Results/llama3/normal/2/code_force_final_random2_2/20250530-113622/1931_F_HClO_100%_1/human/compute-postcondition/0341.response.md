Output State: `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 0, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is undefined, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `i` is `n` - 1, `val` is an empty list, `l3` is undefined, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `l` is undefined, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains no input. If all `l3` were equal to the list of integers excluding `a3`, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the variables in the loop head and body have reached their final values. The loop has processed all the input test cases, and the output has been printed accordingly. The state of the other variables in the precondition remains unchanged.
