Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer greater than or equal to 2, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, _ is at least m - 2, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, i is 1, val is an empty list, a3 is undefined, l3 is undefined, idx1 is 1, idx2 is 1.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`, effectively setting both `idx1` and `idx2` to 1. No other variables are affected by this code.
