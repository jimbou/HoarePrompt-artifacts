The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, i is n - 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 and i is now 0. 
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is at least 2, `_` is either 1 or a string, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is the first element of the last tuple in val, `l11` is a list of integers with all occurrences of a2 removed from l1, `l22` is a list of integers with all occurrences of a1 removed from l2, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 0, `val` contains at least m - 1 tuples, `l3` is the second element of the last tuple in val, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, stdin contains no input.**
