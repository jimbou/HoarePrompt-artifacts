Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is at least 3, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `i` is the current value of `n - 1`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined, stdin contains no input and we have consumed one input from stdin which was empty.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have consumed one input from stdin, which was empty. This means that the program has read one line of input, but since there was no input, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
