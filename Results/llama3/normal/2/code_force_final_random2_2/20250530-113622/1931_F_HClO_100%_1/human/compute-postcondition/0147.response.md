Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer greater than or equal to 2, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, _ is at least m - 2, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is 0, p2 is 1, i is 1, val is an empty list, a3 is undefined, l3 is undefined, idx1 is -1, idx2 is 1.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `idx2` and `p2`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`, making `idx2` equal to 1. The second line assigns the value of 1 to `p2`, making `p2` equal to 1. No other variables are affected by the code snippet.
