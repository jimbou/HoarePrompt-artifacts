To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`.

The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `m`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `_` and `m`. If `_` is less than `m - 2`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 2. The value of `m` remains the same.

State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, m is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is either 1 or 0, p2 is either 1 or 0, i is n - 1, val is a list containing two tuples (a3, l3), a3 is an integer, and l3 is a list of integers**
