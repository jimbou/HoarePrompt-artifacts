Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and `val` is an empty list. If `idx1` is not -1 and `idx2` is -1, then `idx1` is not changed and `idx2` is set to `n - 2`. Otherwise, `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged.***
