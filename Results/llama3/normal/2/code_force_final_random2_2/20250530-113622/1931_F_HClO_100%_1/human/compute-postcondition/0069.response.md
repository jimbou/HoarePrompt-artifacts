Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `idx1` is not -1, `idx2` is `n - 2`, and `val` is an empty list.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `idx2` has been updated to `n - 2`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `idx1` is still not -1, and the rest of the variables retain their initial values.
