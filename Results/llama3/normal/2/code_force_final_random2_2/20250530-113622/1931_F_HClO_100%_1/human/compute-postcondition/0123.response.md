The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `_` is the current value of `m - 1`, so it needs to be adjusted to `_` is at least 1 and `m` is at least 3.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is at least 1, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `i` is the current value of `n - 1`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined**
