To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `m`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. If `m` is at least 3, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `m` is an integer and must be at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `m` must still be at least 3, and `_` must be incremented by 1.

Since `_` is a throwaway variable, its value is not important, but we can infer that it will be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be at least 3, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, and stdin contains the remaining input for the test cases minus one line of input, and the current value of `l11` is not equal to the current value of `l22`.**
