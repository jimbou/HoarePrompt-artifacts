Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and `i` is 0. The current value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1. stdin contains the remaining input for the test cases.**
