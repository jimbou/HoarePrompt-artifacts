Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is exactly 2, `_` is either 1 or a string, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is undefined, `l11` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a2` removed from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a1` removed from `l2`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `l3` is undefined, `i` is `n - 1`. If `idx1` is not -1 and `idx2` is -1, then `idx1` remains not -1 and `idx2` is updated to `n - 2`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `idx1` and `idx2`. Additionally, `idx1` is not less than `idx2`. `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with no changes made to any variables. The `continue` statement simply skips to the next iteration of the loop, without executing any further code in the current iteration.
