Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is at least `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `i` is the current value of `n - 1`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, we have consumed `m - 2` inputs from stdin which were empty, 'no' is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.**
