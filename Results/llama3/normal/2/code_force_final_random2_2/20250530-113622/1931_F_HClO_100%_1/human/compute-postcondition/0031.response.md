Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 0, and stdin contains the remaining input for the test cases. If `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. The current value of `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`.***
