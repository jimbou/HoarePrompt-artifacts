To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `m`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. If `m` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Since `m` is already at least 2, we need to adjust it to be at least 3. The variable `_` is either 1 or a string, but its value does not affect the loop execution, so we don't need to adjust it.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is at least 3, `_` is either 1 or a string, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is undefined, `l11` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a2` removed from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a1` removed from `l2`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `l3` is undefined, `i` is `n - 1`, `idx1` is not -1, `idx2` is `n - 2**, `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2**, `l2` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, and `_` is 1**
