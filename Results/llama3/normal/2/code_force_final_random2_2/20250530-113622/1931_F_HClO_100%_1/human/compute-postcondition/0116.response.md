Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is the current value of `m - 1`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `i` is the current value of `n - 1`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined, `n` and `m` are assigned new values from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, except for `n` and `m`, which are reassigned new values from the input. The input is expected to contain a space-separated list of two integers, which are converted to integers and assigned to `n` and `m`, respectively. The values of `n` and `m` are now determined by the input, but they are still constrained to be integers greater than or equal to 2.
