Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer greater than or equal to 2, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, _ is at least m - 2, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is 0 or 1, p2 is 0 or 1, i is n - 1, val is an empty list, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, l is a list of integers equal to l2 with a2 inserted at index idx1, stdin contains no input. The index of a1 in l3 is greater than or equal to the index of a2 in l3**

The code modifies the list `l2` by inserting the value of `a2` at the index `idx1`. This change is then reflected in the new variable `l`, which is assigned the modified list `l2`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
