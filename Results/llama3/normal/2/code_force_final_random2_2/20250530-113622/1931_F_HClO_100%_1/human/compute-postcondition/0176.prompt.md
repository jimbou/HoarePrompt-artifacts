Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer greater than or equal to 2, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, _ is at least m - 2, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, i is the current value of n - 1, val is an empty list, a3 is undefined, l3 is undefined, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer greater than or equal to 2, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, _ is at least m - 2, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, i is 1, val is an empty list, a3 is undefined, l3 is undefined, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1. If l1[i + p1] is not equal to l2[i + p2], then if l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1, then idx1 is 1 and idx2 is 1. Otherwise, if l1[i + p1] equals a2, then p1 is 1, idx1 is 1, and idx2 is -1. If l1[i + p1] does not equal a2, then p2 is 1, idx2 is 1, and idx1 is -1. In all cases, i is 1. If both idx1 and idx2 are greater than or equal to 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. If l1[i + p1] equals l2[i + p2], then no changes are made. If i + max(p1, p2) equals n - 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is at least `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, `idx1` is 2 and `idx2` is 2. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `p1` is 1, `idx1` is 2, and `p2` and `idx2` remain unchanged. If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2`, then `p2` is 1, `idx2` is 2, and `p1` and `idx1` remain unchanged. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, or if `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is at least `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `i` is 3, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` is 3 and `idx2` is 3. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then if `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
