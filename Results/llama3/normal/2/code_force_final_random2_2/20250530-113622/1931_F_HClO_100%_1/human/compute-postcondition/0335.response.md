To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again. The loop head is `for (a3, l3) in val:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `a3`, `l3`, and `val`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `val` has at least one more tuple to iterate over. At the end of the previous iteration, `val` contains at least 2 tuples, and `(a3, l3)` is the second tuple. For the loop to execute again, `val` must have at least 3 tuples.

The state of `a3` and `l3` will be updated to the next tuple in `val`. Since we don't know the exact values of the next tuple, we can only say that `a3` will be the first element of the third tuple in `val`, and `l3` will be the second element of the third tuple in `val`.

The states of other variables, such as `t`, `n`, `m`, `_`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `idx1`, and `idx2`, do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is at least 3, `_` is either 1 or a string, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is the first element of the third tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the third tuple in `val`, `l11` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a2` removed from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a1` removed from `l2`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, `i` is `n - 1`, `idx1` is not -1, `idx2` is `n - 2`.**
