This function determines whether a set of matrices are permutations of each other. It reads input from stdin, where each test case consists of two integers n and k, followed by k lines of n integers. The function checks if all matrices are permutations of each other by comparing the rows of the matrices, excluding the first element of each row. If all matrices are permutations of each other, it prints 'yes', otherwise it prints 'no'. The function handles multiple test cases and ignores any remaining input after processing each test case.
