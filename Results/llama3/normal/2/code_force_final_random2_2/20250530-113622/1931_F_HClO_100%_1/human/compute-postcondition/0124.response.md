Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is at least 1, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `i` is the current value of `n - 1`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined, stdin contains one less input.**

The code `input()` accepts an input from the user, but it does not assign the input to any variable. Therefore, the values of all variables remain the same. However, since an input is accepted, the number of inputs in the stdin is reduced by one.
