Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, and i is 2. If l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1, then idx1 is 2 and idx2 is 2. Otherwise, if both idx1 and idx2 are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
