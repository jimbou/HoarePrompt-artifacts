To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `m`. The loop will execute again if `_` is less than `m - 2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `m` is an integer and must be at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 2. The value of `m` remains the same, but since `_` is now 2, `m` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be at least 4, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, stdin contains the remaining input for the test cases minus two lines of input, and the current value of `l11` is not equal to the current value of `l22`.**
