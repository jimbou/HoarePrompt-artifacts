Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is at least 2, `_` is either 1 or a string, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is the first element of the last tuple in val, `l11` is a list of integers with all occurrences of a2 removed from l1, `l22` is a list of integers with all occurrences of a1 removed from l2, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` contains at least m - 1 tuples, `l3` is the second element of the last tuple in val, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, stdin contains no input. The current value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n` minus 1. The current value of `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`. Either `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` or `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`***
