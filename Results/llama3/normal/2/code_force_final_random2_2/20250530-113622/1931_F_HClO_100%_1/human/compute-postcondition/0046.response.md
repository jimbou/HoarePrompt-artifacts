Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, idx1 is either i or -1, idx2 is 1, p1 is either 1 or 0, p2 is 1, and i is 1.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`, making `idx2` equal to 1. The second line assigns the value 1 to `p2`, making `p2` equal to 1. No other variables are affected by the code.
