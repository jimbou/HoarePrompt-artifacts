To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `m`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `_` and `m`. If `_` is less than `m - 2`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is at least 2, and `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3.

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes at least 3. Since `_` is now 3, `m` must be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables in the state (`t`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `val`, `a3`, and `l3`) are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is at least 3, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `i` is the current value of `n - 1`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined, stdin contains no input.**
