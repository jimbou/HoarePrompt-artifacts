Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than `i + 2`, `m` is at least 2, `_` is either 1 or a string, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is the first element of the last tuple in `val`, `l11` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a2` removed from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a1` removed from `l2`, `val` contains at least `m - 1` tuples, `l3` is the second element of the last tuple in `val`, `i` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but the program execution is interrupted, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
