Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 1, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is the first element of the last tuple in `val`, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `i` is `n` - 1, `val` contains at least `m` - 1 tuples, `l3` is the second element of the last tuple in `val`, `stdin` contains no input. If `idx1` < `idx2`, then `l2` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at `idx1`, and `l` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at `idx1`. If `idx1` >= `idx2`, then if `idx1` > `idx2`, `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, and `l` is a list of integers equal to `l1` with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`. Otherwise, if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, then `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, and `l` is a list of integers equal to `l1` with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`. Otherwise, `l2` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, and `l` is a list of integers equal to `l2` with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`. If `idx2` is -1 and `idx1` is not -1, then `idx1` is not -1 and `idx2` is `n` - 2, `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val`. If the current value of `l3` is equal to the list of integers in `l` excluding `a3`, then the program continues. Otherwise, 'no' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and 'yes' is printed**

The code executes a continue statement, which means it skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next one. The values of all variables remain the same, and the program continues to the next iteration.
