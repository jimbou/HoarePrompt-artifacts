Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether a set of matrices are permutations of each other. The program reads input from stdin, where each test case consists of two integers n and k, followed by k lines of n integers. It checks if all matrices are permutations of each other by comparing the rows of the matrices, excluding the first element of each row. If all matrices are permutations of each other, it prints 'yes', otherwise it prints 'no'. The program handles multiple test cases and ignores any remaining input after processing each test case.

The program uses a clever approach to compare the matrices. It first compares the first two matrices and finds the index where they differ. It then inserts the missing element into one of the matrices to make them identical. It then compares the resulting matrix with the remaining matrices. If any of the remaining matrices are not permutations of the resulting matrix, it prints 'no'. Otherwise, it prints 'yes'.

The program also handles edge cases correctly. For example, if there is only one matrix, it prints 'yes'. If there are only two matrices, it prints 'yes' if they are permutations of each other, and 'no' otherwise.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient. It has a time complexity of O(nk), where n is the number of rows in the matrices and k is the number of matrices. This is because it only needs to compare each matrix with the resulting matrix once.

Correctness: **True**
