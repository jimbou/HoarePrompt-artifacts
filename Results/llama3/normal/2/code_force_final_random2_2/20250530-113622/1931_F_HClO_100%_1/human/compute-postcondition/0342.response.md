Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is the current value of `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `i` is the current value of `n - 1`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined. If all `l3` were equal to the list of integers excluding `a3`, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The values of `m`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `val`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body. The loop has finished executing, and the program has printed 'yes' if all `l3` were equal to the list of integers excluding `a3`, and 'no' otherwise.
