Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers, stdin contains the remaining input for the test cases. If `m` is 1, the first line of stdin is read and discarded, 'yes' is printed, and we move on to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
