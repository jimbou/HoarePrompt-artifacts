Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0, _ is m - 2, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, m is an integer greater than or equal to 2, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is either 1 or 0, p2 is either 1 or 0, i is n - 1, val is a list containing m - 2 tuples (a3, l3), a3 is an integer, and l3 is a list of integers, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is the current value of `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `i` is the current value of `n - 1`, `val` is a list containing at least 1 tuple `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first `a3` in the list, `l3` is the first `l3` in the list. If `l3` is not equal to the list of integers excluding `a3`, then 'no' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is the current value of `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `i` is the current value of `n - 1`, `val` is a list containing at least 2 tuples `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the second `a3` in the list, `l3` is the second `l3` in the list. If `l3` is not equal to the list of integers excluding `a3`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is the current value of `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `i` is the current value of `n - 1`, `val` is a list containing at least 3 tuples `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the third `a3` in the list, `l3` is the third `l3` in the list. If `l3` is not equal to the list of integers excluding `a3`, then 'no' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
