Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than i + 2, m is at least 2, _ is either 1 or a string, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, a3 is the first element of the last tuple in val, l11 is a list of integers with all occurrences of a2 removed from l1, l22 is a list of integers with all occurrences of a1 removed from l2, val contains at least m - 1 tuples, l3 is the second element of the last tuple in val, i is increased by 1. If l1[i + p1] equals a2, then idx1 is i and p1 is 1. Otherwise, idx2 is equal to the new value of i and p2 is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. All variables retain their original values and properties, and no new variables are introduced. The break statement only affects the control flow of the program, but does not modify any variables.
