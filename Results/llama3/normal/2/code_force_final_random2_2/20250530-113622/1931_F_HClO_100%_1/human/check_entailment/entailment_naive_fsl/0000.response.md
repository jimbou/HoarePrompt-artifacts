Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when there are multiple possible orders that all screenshots could have been obtained from. In the problem description, it is stated that the task is to determine whether there is a certain order that all screenshots correspond to. However, the program only checks if the order of participants in the first two screenshots is consistent with the order in the remaining screenshots. It does not consider the possibility that there may be multiple consistent orders.

For example, consider the case where the input is:

5 3
1 2 3 4 5
2 3 4 5 1
3 4 5 1 2

The program will output "yes" because the order of participants in the first two screenshots is consistent with the order in the third screenshot. However, there is another possible order that all screenshots could have been obtained from, which is [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]. The program does not consider this possibility and therefore incorrectly outputs "yes".

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to check all possible orders of participants and verify that at least one of them is consistent with all screenshots.
