Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether there is a certain order that all screenshots correspond to.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of participants `n` and the number of screenshots `m`.
3. If `m` is 1, it simply prints "yes" because there is only one screenshot, and it is always possible to find an order that corresponds to it.
4. If `m` is greater than 1, it reads the first two screenshots and extracts the lists of participants `l1` and `l2`.
5. It then checks if the lists `l1` and `l2` are identical except for the first element (which is the author of the screenshot). If they are not identical, it prints "no" and moves on to the next test case.
6. If the lists are identical, it checks if the first element of `l1` is equal to the second element of `l2` and vice versa. If this is the case, it means that the authors of the two screenshots are in the same position in the list, and it sets `idx1` and `idx2` to the index of this position.
7. If `idx1` and `idx2` are not set, it means that the authors of the two screenshots are not in the same position in the list. In this case, it checks if the first element of `l1` is equal to the second element of `l2` or vice versa. If this is the case, it sets `idx1` or `idx2` to the index of this position.
8. If `idx1` and `idx2` are still not set, it means that the authors of the two screenshots are not in the same position in the list, and it prints "no".
9. If `idx1` and `idx2` are set, it inserts the author of the first screenshot into the list of the second screenshot at the position `idx1`, and vice versa. This creates a new list `l` that represents the order of participants.
10. It then reads the remaining screenshots and checks if they correspond to the order `l`. If any of the screenshots do not correspond to `l`, it prints "no".
11. If all screenshots correspond to `l`, it prints "yes".

The program's logic is correct, and it correctly determines whether there is a certain order that all screenshots correspond to.

Correctness: **True**
