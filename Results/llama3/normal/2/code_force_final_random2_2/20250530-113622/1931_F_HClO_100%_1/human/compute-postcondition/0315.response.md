Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, m is at least 1, _ is either 1 or a string, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, a3 is either undefined or an integer, l11 is a list of integers with all occurrences of a2 removed from l1, l22 is a list of integers with all occurrences of a1 removed from l2, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is either an empty list or a list containing a tuple of (a3, l3), i is n - 1, idx1 is not -1, idx2 is n - 2. If idx1 > idx2, then idx1 is not -1 and greater than idx2, idx2 is n - 2, l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, and l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2. Otherwise, idx1 is not -1, idx2 is n - 2, and if the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2, then l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 and l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2. Otherwise, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 and l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1.***
