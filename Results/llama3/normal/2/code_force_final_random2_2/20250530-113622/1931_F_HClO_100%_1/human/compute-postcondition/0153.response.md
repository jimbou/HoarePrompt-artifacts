Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer greater than or equal to 2, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, _ is at least m - 2, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, i is 1, val is an empty list, a3 is undefined, l3 is undefined, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1. If l1[i + p1] is not equal to l2[i + p2], then if l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1, then idx1 is 1 and idx2 is 1. Otherwise, if l1[i + p1] equals a2, then p1 is 1, idx1 is 1, and idx2 is -1. If l1[i + p1] does not equal a2, then p2 is 1, idx2 is 1, and idx1 is -1. In all cases, i is 1. If both idx1 and idx2 are greater than or equal to 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. If l1[i + p1] equals l2[i + p2], then no changes are made. If i + max(p1, p2) equals n - 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
