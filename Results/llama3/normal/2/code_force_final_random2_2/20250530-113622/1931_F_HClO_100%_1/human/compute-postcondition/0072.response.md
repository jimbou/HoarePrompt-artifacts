Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is either 1 or 0, p2 is either 1 or 0, i is n - 1, val is an empty list, idx1 is less than idx2, and l is a list of integers equal to l2 with a2 inserted at index idx1.**

In this output state, the code has modified the list `l2` by inserting the value of `a2` at the index `idx1`. The list `l` is now equal to the modified list `l2`. All other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `idx1` and `idx2` is maintained, with `idx1` being less than `idx2`.
