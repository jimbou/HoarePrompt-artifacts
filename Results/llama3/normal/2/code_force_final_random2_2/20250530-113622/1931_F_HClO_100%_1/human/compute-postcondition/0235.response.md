Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 1, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is the first element of the last tuple in `val`, `l11` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a2` removed from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a1` removed from `l2`, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `i` is `n` - 1, `val` contains at least `m` - 1 tuples, `l3` is the second element of the last tuple in `val`, `stdin` contains no input.**

The code block reads two lines of input from `stdin`, each containing a list of integers. The first line is split into `a1` and `l1`, and the second line is split into `a2` and `l2`. Then, it creates two new lists, `l11` and `l22`, by removing all occurrences of `a2` from `l1` and all occurrences of `a1` from `l2`, respectively. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
