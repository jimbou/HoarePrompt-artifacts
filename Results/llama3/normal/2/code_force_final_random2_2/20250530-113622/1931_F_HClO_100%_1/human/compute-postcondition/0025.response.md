Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1. stdin contains the remaining input for the test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. All variables retain their original values, and the relationship between `i`, `p1`, `p2`, and `n` remains the same. The stdin still contains the remaining input for the test cases.
