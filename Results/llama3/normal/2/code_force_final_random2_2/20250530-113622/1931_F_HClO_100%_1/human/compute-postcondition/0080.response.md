Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is 2, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is not less than `idx2` and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, and 'yes' is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding `idx1` and `idx2` are still valid.
