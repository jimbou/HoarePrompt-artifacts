Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is the current value of `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `i` is the current value of `n - 1`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined. If all `l3` were equal to the list of integers excluding `a3`, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `t`, `m`, `n`, `_`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `p1`, `p2`, and `i` remain unchanged. The list `val` is now empty, and the variables `a3` and `l3` are no longer defined. If all iterations of the loop found that `l3` was equal to the list of integers excluding `a3`, then the program prints 'yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'no'.
