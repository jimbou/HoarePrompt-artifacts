Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, and stdin contains the remaining input for the test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `idx1` is either `i` or -1, `idx2` is either `i` or -1, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, and `i` is 0, and stdin contains the remaining input for the test cases. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are either `i` or -1, and `p1` and `p2` are either 1 or 0. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative or if `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, idx1 is either i or -1, idx2 is either i or -1, p1 is either 1 or 0, p2 is either 1 or 0, and i is 1. If l1[i + p1] is not equal to l2[i + p2], then idx1 and idx2 are updated based on the values of l1[i + p1] and l2[i + p2] and their relationship with a1 and a2. If both idx1 and idx2 are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If i plus the maximum of p1 and p2 equals n minus 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, and i is 2. If l1[i + p1] is not equal to l2[i + p2], then if l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1, idx1 is 2 and idx2 is 2. Otherwise, if both idx1 and idx2 are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. If l1[i + p1] equals l2[i + p2], then no change occurs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
