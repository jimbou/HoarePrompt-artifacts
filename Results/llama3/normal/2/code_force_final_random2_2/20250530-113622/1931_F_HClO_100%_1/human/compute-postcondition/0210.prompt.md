Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *t is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer greater than or equal to 2, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, _ is at least m - 2, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, a3 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is 0 or 1, p2 is 0 or 1, i is n - 1, val is a list containing a tuple of (a3, l3), stdin contains no input. If idx1 < idx2, then l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at idx1, and l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at idx1. If idx1 >= idx2, then if idx1 > idx2, l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, and l is a list of integers equal to l1 with a1 inserted at index idx2. Otherwise, if the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, then l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, and l is a list of integers equal to l1 with a1 inserted at index idx2. Otherwise, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, and l is a list of integers equal to l2 with a2 inserted at index idx1. If idx2 is -1 and idx1 is not -1, then idx1 is not -1 and idx2 is n - 2.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer greater than or equal to 3, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, _ is at least 1, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, a3 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is 0 or 1, p2 is 0 or 1, i is n - 1, val is a list containing two tuples of (a3, l3), stdin contains no input. If idx1 < idx2, then l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at idx1, and l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at idx1. If idx1 >= idx2, then if idx1 > idx2, l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, and l is a list of integers equal to l1 with a1 inserted at index idx2. Otherwise, if the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, then l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, and l is a list of integers equal to l1 with a1 inserted at index idx2. Otherwise, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, and l is a list of integers equal to l2 with a2 inserted at index idx1. If idx2 is -1 and idx1 is not -1, then idx1 is not -1 and idx2 is n - 2

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer greater than or equal to 3, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, _ is at least 2, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, a3 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is 0 or 1, p2 is 0 or 1, i is n - 1, val is a list containing three tuples of (a3, l3), stdin contains no input. If idx1 < idx2, then l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at idx1, and l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at idx1. If idx1 >= idx2, then if idx1 > idx2, l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, and l is a list of integers equal to l1 with a1 inserted at index idx2. Otherwise, if the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, then l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, and l is a list of integers equal to l1 with a1 inserted at index idx2. Otherwise, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, and l is a list of integers equal to l2 with a2 inserted at index idx1. If idx2 is -1 and idx1 is not -1, then idx1 is not -1 and idx2 is n - 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer greater than or equal to 3, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, _ is at least 1, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, a3 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is 0 or 1, p2 is 0 or 1, i is n - 1, val is a list containing four tuples of (a3, l3), stdin contains no input. If idx1 < idx2, then l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at idx1, and l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at idx1. If idx1 >= idx2, then if idx1 > idx2, l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, and l is a list of integers equal to l1 with a1 inserted at index idx2. Otherwise, if the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, then l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, and l is a list of integers equal to l1 with a1 inserted at index idx2. Otherwise, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, and l is a list of integers equal to l2 with a2 inserted at index idx1. If idx2 is -1 and idx1 is not -1, then idx1 is not -1 and idx2 is n - 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
