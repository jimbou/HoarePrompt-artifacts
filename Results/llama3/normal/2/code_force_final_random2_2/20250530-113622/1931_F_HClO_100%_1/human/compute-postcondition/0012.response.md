The code `input()` accepts a line of input from stdin and discards it. The values of the variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, and `l22` are not affected by this code. However, since stdin contains the remaining input for the test cases, the input() function will consume one line of input from stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be at least 3, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, and stdin contains the remaining input for the test cases minus one line of input, and the current value of `l11` is not equal to the current value of `l22`.**
