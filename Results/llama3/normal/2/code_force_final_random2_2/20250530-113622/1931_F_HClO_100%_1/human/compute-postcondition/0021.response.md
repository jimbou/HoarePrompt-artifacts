Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, and stdin contains the remaining input for the test cases. If the current value of l11 is not equal to the current value of l22, then _ is set to m - 2, stdin contains the remaining input for the test cases minus (m - 1) lines of input, and 'no' is printed. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
