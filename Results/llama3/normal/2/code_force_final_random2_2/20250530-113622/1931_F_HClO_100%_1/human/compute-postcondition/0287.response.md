Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than i + 2, m is at least 2, _ is either 1 or a string, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, a3 is the first element of the last tuple in val, l11 is a list of integers with all occurrences of a2 removed from l1, l22 is a list of integers with all occurrences of a1 removed from l2, val contains at least m - 1 tuples, l3 is the second element of the last tuple in val, i is increased by 1. If l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1, then idx1 is i and idx2 is i. If l1[i + p1] equals a2 but l2[i + p2] does not equal a1, then idx1 is i and p1 is 1. If l1[i + p1] does not equal a2, then idx2 is equal to the new value of i and p2 is 1. If both idx1 and idx2 are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no additional changes occur.***
