Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is at least 2, `_` is either 1 or a string, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is the first element of the last tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the last tuple in `val`, `l11` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a2` removed from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a1` removed from `l2`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `i` is `n - 1`, `idx1` is not -1, `idx2` is `n - 2`. If `l3` is not equal to the list of integers in `l` excluding `a3`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times, with the only difference being that `val` is now an empty list, indicating that all tuples have been processed. The values of `a3` and `l3` are the first and second elements of the last tuple in `val`, respectively. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
