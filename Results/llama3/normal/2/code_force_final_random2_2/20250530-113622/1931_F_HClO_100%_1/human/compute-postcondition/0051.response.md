Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, idx1 is either i or -1, idx2 is either i or -1, p1 is either 1 or 0, p2 is either 1 or 0, and i is 1. If l1[i + p1] is not equal to l2[i + p2], then idx1 and idx2 are updated based on the values of l1[i + p1] and l2[i + p2] and their relationship with a1 and a2. If both idx1 and idx2 are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If i plus the maximum of p1 and p2 equals n minus 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
