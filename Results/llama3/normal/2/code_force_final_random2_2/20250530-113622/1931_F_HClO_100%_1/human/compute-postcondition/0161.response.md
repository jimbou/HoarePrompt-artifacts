Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is at least `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `p1` is 1, `idx1` is 2, and `p2` and `idx2` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `p2` is 1, `idx2` is 2, and `p1` and `idx1` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, but this does not affect the values of the variables. The conditional statements regarding `p1`, `idx1`, `p2`, and `idx2` remain the same as in the initial state.
