Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, m is at least 2, _ is either 1 or a string, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers with all occurrences of a2 removed from l1, l22 is a list of integers with all occurrences of a1 removed from l2, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is a list containing m - 2 tuples: (a3, l3) from the input, i is n - 1, idx1 is not -1, idx2 is n - 2, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is at least 3, `_` is either 1 or a string, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val`, `l11` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a2` removed from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a1` removed from `l2`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing at least 1 tuple: `(a3, l3)`, `i` is `n - 1`, `idx1` is not -1, `idx2` is `n - 2`, and if `l3` is not equal to the list of integers in `l` excluding `a3`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is at least 3, `_` is either 1 or a string, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is the first element of the second tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the second tuple in `val`, `l11` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a2` removed from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a1` removed from `l2`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing at least 2 tuples, `i` is `n - 1`, `idx1` is not -1, `idx2` is `n - 2`. If `l3` is not equal to the list of integers in `l` excluding `a3`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is at least 3, `_` is either 1 or a string, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is the first element of the third tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the third tuple in `val`, `l11` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a2` removed from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a1` removed from `l2`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, `i` is `n - 1`, `idx1` is not -1, `idx2` is `n - 2`. If `l3` is not equal to the list of integers in `l` excluding `a3`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
