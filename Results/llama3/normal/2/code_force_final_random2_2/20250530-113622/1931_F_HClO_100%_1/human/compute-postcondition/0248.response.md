Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, m is at least 2, _ is either 1 or a string, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, a3 is the first element of the last tuple in val, l11 is a list of integers with all occurrences of a2 removed from l1, l22 is a list of integers with all occurrences of a1 removed from l2, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, i is n - 1, val contains at least m - 1 tuples, l3 is the second element of the last tuple in val, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1, stdin contains no input.**

The code snippet initializes `idx1` and `idx2` to -1 and resets `p1` and `p2` to 0. The initial state's conditions and values for other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the executed code.
