Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than `i + 1`, `m` is at least 2, `_` is either 1 or a string, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is the first element of the last tuple in `val`, `l11` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a2` removed from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a1` removed from `l2`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` contains at least `m - 1` tuples, `l3` is the second element of the last tuple in `val`, `idx1` is either `-1` or `i`, `idx2` is either `-1` or `i`. If `i + max(p1, p2)` is equal to `n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, `i` is increased by 1.**
