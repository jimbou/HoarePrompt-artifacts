Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is at least 2, `_` is either 1 or a string, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is the first element of the last tuple in `val`, `l11` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a2` removed from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a1` removed from `l2`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` contains at least `m - 1` tuples, `l3` is the second element of the last tuple in `val`, `idx1` is either `-1` or `i`, `idx2` is either `-1` or `i`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then if `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is `i` and `idx2` is `i`. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, then `p1` is 1 and `idx1` is `i`. Otherwise, if `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `p2` is 1 and `idx2` is `i`. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
