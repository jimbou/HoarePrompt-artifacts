Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer greater than or equal to 2, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, _ is at least m - 2, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is 1, p2 is 0, i is 1, val is an empty list, a3 is undefined, l3 is undefined, idx1 is 1, idx2 is -1.**

The code modifies the values of `idx1` and `p1`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `idx1`, making `idx1` equal to 1. The second line assigns the value of 1 to `p1`, making `p1` equal to 1. No other variables are affected.
