Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, m is at least 3, _ is either 1 or a string, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers with all occurrences of a2 removed from l1, l22 is a list of integers with all occurrences of a1 removed from l2, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is a list containing a tuple (a3, l3), i is n - 1, idx1 is not -1, idx2 is n - 2**

The code snippet assigns the integer value of the input to `a3` and the remaining integers to `l3`. It then appends a tuple containing `a3` and `l3` to the list `val`. The value of `a3` is an integer, and `l3` is a list of integers. No other variables are affected.
