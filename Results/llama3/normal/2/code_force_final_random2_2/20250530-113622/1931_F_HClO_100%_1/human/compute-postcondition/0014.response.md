Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be at least 3, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, stdin contains the remaining input for the test cases minus two lines of input, and the current value of `l11` is not equal to the current value of `l22`.**

The code `input()` reads a line from the standard input and discards it, effectively consuming one line of input. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains the remaining input for the test cases minus one line of input, after executing the code, stdin will contain the remaining input for the test cases minus two lines of input. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
