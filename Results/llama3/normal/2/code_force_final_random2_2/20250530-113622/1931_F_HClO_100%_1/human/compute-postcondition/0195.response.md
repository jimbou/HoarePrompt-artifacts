Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is at least `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `m`, `n`, `_`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, and `val` remain unchanged. The values of `a3` and `l3` are updated to be an integer and a list of integers, respectively, which are obtained from the input. The stdin is now empty, as the input has been consumed.
