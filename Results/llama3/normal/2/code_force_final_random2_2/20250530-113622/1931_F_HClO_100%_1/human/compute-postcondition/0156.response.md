Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is at least `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 2, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1. If `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
