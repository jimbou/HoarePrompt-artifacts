Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers, `m` is 1, stdin contains the remaining input for the test cases except the first line which has been read and discarded**

The code `input()` reads a line from the standard input and discards it, without assigning it to any variable. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The only change is that the first line of the input has been read and discarded, so the stdin now contains the remaining input for the test cases except the first line.
