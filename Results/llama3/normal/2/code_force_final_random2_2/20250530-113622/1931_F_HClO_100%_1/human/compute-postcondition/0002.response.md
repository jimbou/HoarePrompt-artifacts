Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers, stdin contains the remaining input for the test cases**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The code assigns the values of `n` and `m` from the input, which are integers. The stdin still contains the remaining input for the test cases.
