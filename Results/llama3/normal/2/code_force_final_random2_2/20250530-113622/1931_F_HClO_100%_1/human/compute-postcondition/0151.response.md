Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is at least `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then the current value of `p1` is 1, the current value of `idx1` is 1, and the current value of `idx2` is -1. Otherwise, the current value of `p2` is 1, the current value of `idx2` is 1, and the current value of `idx1` is -1. Additionally, the current value of `i` is 1. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are greater than or equal to 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
