Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, and i is 2. If l1[i + p1] equals a2, then idx1 is 2, p1 is 1, and p2 is either 1 or 0. Otherwise, idx2 is 2, p2 is 1, and p1 is either 1 or 0. If i + max(p1, p2) equals n - 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
