Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, m is at least 2, _ is either 1 or a string, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, a3 is the first element of the last tuple in val, l11 is a list of integers with all occurrences of a2 removed from l1, l22 is a list of integers with all occurrences of a1 removed from l2, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, i is n - 1, val contains at least m - 1 tuples, l3 is the second element of the last tuple in val, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is at least 2, `_` is either 1 or a string, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is the first element of the last tuple in `val`, `l11` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a2` removed from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a1` removed from `l2`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` contains at least `m - 1` tuples, `l3` is the second element of the last tuple in `val`, `idx1` is either `-1` or `i`, `idx2` is either `-1` or `i`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then if `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is `i` and `idx2` is `i`. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, then `p1` is 1 and `idx1` is `i`. Otherwise, if `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `p2` is 1 and `idx2` is `i`. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than `i + 1`, `m` is at least 2, `_` is either 1 or a string, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is the first element of the last tuple in `val`, `l11` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a2` removed from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a1` removed from `l2`, `val` contains at least `m - 1` tuples, `l3` is the second element of the last tuple in `val`, `i` is increased by 1. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is set to `i` and `idx2` is set to `i`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then if `i + max(p1, p2)` is equal to `n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than `i + 2`, `m` is at least 2, `_` is either 1 or a string, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is the first element of the last tuple in `val`, `l11` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a2` removed from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a1` removed from `l2`, `val` contains at least `m - 1` tuples, `l3` is the second element of the last tuple in `val`, `i` is increased by 1. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, `idx1` is `i` and `idx2` is `i`. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` but `l2[i + p2]` does not equal `a1`, then `idx1` is `i` and `p1` is 1. If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2`, then `idx2` is equal to the new value of `i` and `p2` is 1. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no additional changes occur. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `l2[i + p2]`, then no changes occur.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
