Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than `i + 1`, `m` is at least 2, `_` is either 1 or a string, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is the first element of the last tuple in `val`, `l11` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a2` removed from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a1` removed from `l2`, `val` contains at least `m - 1` tuples, `l3` is the second element of the last tuple in `val`, `i` is increased by 1. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is set to `i` and `idx2` is set to `i`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then if `i + max(p1, p2)` is equal to `n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
