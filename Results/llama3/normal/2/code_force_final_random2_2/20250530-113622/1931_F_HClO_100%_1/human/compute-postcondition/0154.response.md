The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is at least `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 2, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1**
