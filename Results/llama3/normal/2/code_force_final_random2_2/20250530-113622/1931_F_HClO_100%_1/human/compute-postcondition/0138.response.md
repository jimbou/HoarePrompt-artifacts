Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is at least `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 1, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code only contains a break statement, which means it will exit the innermost loop or if statement it is currently inside. The values of all variables remain the same, but the program flow is interrupted, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
