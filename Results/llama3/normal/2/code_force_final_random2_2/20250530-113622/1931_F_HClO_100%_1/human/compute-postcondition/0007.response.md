The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. Since we are already inside a loop, the `continue` statement will cause the loop to move on to the next iteration.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers, `m` is 1, stdin contains the remaining input for the test cases except the first line which has been read and discarded, 'yes' is being printed, and we move on to the next iteration of the loop.**
