Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer and equals 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is at least `m - 2` which is 0, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined. If `idx2` is -1 and `idx1` is not -1, then `idx1` is not -1 and `idx2` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, the values of `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged. Additionally, `idx1` is not less than `idx2` and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`***
