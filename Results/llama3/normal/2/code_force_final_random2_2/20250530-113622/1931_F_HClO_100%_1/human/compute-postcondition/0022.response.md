Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, and stdin contains the remaining input for the test cases.**

The code snippet initializes four new variables: idx1, idx2, p1, and p2. The first two lines assign -1 to idx1 and idx2, respectively. The second two lines assign 0 to p1 and p2, respectively. None of the existing variables are modified by the code. The state of the variables t, _, n, m, a1, l1, a2, l2, l11, and l22 remains unchanged, as they are not affected by the code. The stdin also remains unchanged, as no input operations are performed.
