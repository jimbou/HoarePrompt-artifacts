Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is not less than `idx2` and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: All variables from the initial state remain unchanged, except that `a3` is assigned the first integer from the input, and `l3` is assigned the remaining integers from the input. The input is consumed, so stdin is now empty.
