Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is at least `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, `idx1` is 2 and `idx2` is 2. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `p1` is 1, `idx1` is 2, and `p2` and `idx2` remain unchanged. If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2`, then `p2` is 1, `idx2` is 2, and `p1` and `idx1` remain unchanged. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, or if `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
