Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, stdin contains the remaining input for the test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code reads two lines from stdin, each containing a list of integers, and assigns the first integer of each line to `a1` and `a2`, respectively. The remaining integers in each line are assigned to `l1` and `l2`, respectively. The code then creates two new lists, `l11` and `l22`, by filtering out the integers that are equal to `a2` and `a1` from `l1` and `l2`, respectively. The state of stdin is updated to reflect that two lines of input have been consumed.
