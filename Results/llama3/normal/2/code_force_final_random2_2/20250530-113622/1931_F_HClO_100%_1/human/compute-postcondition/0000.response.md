The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains one or more test cases, and each test case starts with two integers `n` and `k`, the first integer read from stdin is assigned to `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains the remaining input for the test cases**
