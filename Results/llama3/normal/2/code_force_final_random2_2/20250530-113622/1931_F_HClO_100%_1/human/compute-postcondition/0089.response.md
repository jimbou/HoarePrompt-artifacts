Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and `val` is a list of tuples with (a3, l3) appended to it. If `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, then `l1` has `a1` inserted at index `idx2` and `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`. Otherwise, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2` and `val` contains a tuple (a3, l3). Additionally, `idx1` is not less than `idx2`.**
