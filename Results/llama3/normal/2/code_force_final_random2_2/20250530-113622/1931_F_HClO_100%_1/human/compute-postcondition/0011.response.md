According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the current value of `l11` is not equal to the current value of `l22`, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `m` is at least 3 and `_` is 0.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be at least 3, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains the remaining input for the test cases, and the current value of `l11` is not equal to the current value of `l22`.**
