Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer greater than or equal to 2, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, _ is at least m - 2, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at idx1, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is 0 or 1, p2 is 0 or 1, i is n - 1, val is an empty list, a3 is undefined, l3 is undefined, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at idx1, idx1 is less than idx2, and if idx2 is -1 and idx1 is not -1, then idx1 is not -1 and idx2 is n - 2.**

In this output state, the value of `l2` has been modified by inserting `a2` at the index `idx1`. The new list `l` is assigned the modified `l2`. All other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `idx1` and `idx2` is maintained, with `idx1` being less than `idx2`. If `idx2` is -1 and `idx1` is not -1, then `idx1` is not -1 and `idx2` is `n - 2`.
