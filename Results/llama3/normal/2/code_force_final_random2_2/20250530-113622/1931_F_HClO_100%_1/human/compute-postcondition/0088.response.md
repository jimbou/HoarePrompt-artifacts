Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is either 1 or 0, p2 is either 1 or 0, i is n - 1, val is a list of tuples with (a3, l3) appended to it, idx1 is not less than idx2 and idx1 is less than or equal to idx2, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, stdin contains no input.**

The code snippet has the following effects on the program state:

*   The first line appends a tuple containing the values of `a3` and `l3` to the list `val`. This modifies the state of `val` by adding a new element to it.
*   The second line decrements the value of `m` by 1. However, since `m` is not defined in the initial state, this line does not affect any variables in the output state.

All other variables remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code snippet.
