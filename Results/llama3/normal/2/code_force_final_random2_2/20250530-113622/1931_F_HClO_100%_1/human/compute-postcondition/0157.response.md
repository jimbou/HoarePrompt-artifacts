Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer greater than or equal to 2, n is an integer greater than 2, _ is at least m - 2, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, i is 2, val is an empty list, a3 is undefined, l3 is undefined, idx1 is 2, idx2 is 2.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`, effectively setting them to 2. No other variables are affected by this code. The condition `i + max(p1, p2)` is not relevant in this case, as the `break` statement is not conditional and will always be executed.
