Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 1, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is the first element of the last tuple in `val`, `l11` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a2` removed from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a1` removed from `l2`, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `i` is `n` - 1, `val` contains at least `m` - 1 tuples, `l3` is the second element of the last tuple in `val`, `stdin` contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    input()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is at least 3, `_` is a string (the input from stdin), `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is the first element of the last tuple in `val`, `l11` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a2` removed from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a1` removed from `l2`, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `i` is `n` - 1, `val` contains at least `m` - 1 tuples, `l3` is the second element of the last tuple in `val`, stdin contains no input

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is at least 4, `_` is a string (the input from stdin), `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is the first element of the last tuple in `val`, `l11` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a2` removed from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a1` removed from `l2`, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `i` is `n` - 1, `val` contains at least `m` - 1 tuples, `l3` is the second element of the last tuple in `val`, stdin contains no input, `_` is a string (the input from stdin).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is at least 4, `_` is a string (the input from stdin), `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is the first element of the last tuple in `val`, `l11` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a2` removed from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a1` removed from `l2`, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `i` is `n` - 1, `val` contains at least `m` - 1 tuples, `l3` is the second element of the last tuple in `val`, stdin contains no input, `_` is a string (the input from stdin), and a new string has been read from stdin and discarded.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
