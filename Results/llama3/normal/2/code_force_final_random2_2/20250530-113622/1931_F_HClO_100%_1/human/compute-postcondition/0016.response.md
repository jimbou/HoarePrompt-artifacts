Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be at least 4, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, stdin contains the remaining input for the test cases minus three lines of input, and the current value of `l11` is not equal to the current value of `l22`.**

The code `input()` reads a line from the standard input and discards it, without assigning it to any variable. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged. However, since one line of input has been read and discarded, the stdin now contains the remaining input for the test cases minus three lines of input.
