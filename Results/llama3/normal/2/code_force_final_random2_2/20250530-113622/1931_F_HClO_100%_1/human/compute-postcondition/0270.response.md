Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than i + 1, m is at least 2, _ is either 1 or a string, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, a3 is the first element of the last tuple in val, l11 is a list of integers with all occurrences of a2 removed from l1, l22 is a list of integers with all occurrences of a1 removed from l2, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val contains at least m - 1 tuples, l3 is the second element of the last tuple in val, idx1 is i, idx2 is i, i is increased by 1.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `idx1 = idx2 = i` and `break`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. The second line breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. 

Since `i` is increased by 1, the new value of `i` is `i + 1`. The values of `idx1` and `idx2` are updated to `i`, which is now `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
