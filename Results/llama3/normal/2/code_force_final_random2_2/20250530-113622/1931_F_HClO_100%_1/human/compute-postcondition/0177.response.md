Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is at least `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined, `idx1` is -1, 0, 1, 2, or `n - 1`, `idx2` is -1, 0, 1, 2, or `n - 1`.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values and properties, except for `val`, which is now explicitly set to an empty list. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, with their initial values and relationships still holding true.
