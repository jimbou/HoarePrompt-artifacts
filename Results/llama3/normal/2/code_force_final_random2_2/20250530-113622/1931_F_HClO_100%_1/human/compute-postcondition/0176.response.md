Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer greater than or equal to 2, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, _ is at least m - 2, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is 0 or 1, p2 is 0 or 1, i is n - 1, val is an empty list, a3 is undefined, l3 is undefined, idx1 is -1, 0, 1, 2, or n - 1, idx2 is -1, 0, 1, 2, or n - 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The values of `t`, `m`, `n`, `_`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `val`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged.

- The value of `i` is `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has executed `n - 1` times.

- The values of `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, depending on the conditions met during the loop iterations.

- The values of `idx1` and `idx2` are either -1, 0, 1, 2, or `n - 1`, depending on the conditions met during the loop iterations. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
