Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is at least 2, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `i` is the current value of `n - 1`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined, stdin contains no input.**

The code `input()` accepts one input from stdin, but since stdin contains one less input, it will be empty after this operation. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
