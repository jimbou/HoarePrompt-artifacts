Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, and `i` is 2. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, as specified by the `break` statement.
