Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is either 1 or 0, p2 is either 1 or 0, i is n - 1, val is an empty list, idx1 is not less than idx2 and idx1 is less than or equal to idx2, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, l is a list of integers equal to l2 with a2 inserted at index idx1, stdin contains no input. The index of a1 in l3 is greater than or equal to the index of a2 in l3**

The code inserts `a2` at index `idx1` in `l2`, creating a new list `l` that is equal to `l2` with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
