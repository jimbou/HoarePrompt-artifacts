Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, m is at least 4, _ is either 2 or a string, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers with all occurrences of a2 removed from l1, l22 is a list of integers with all occurrences of a1 removed from l2, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is a list containing three tuples: (a3, l3) and the new tuple (a3, l3) from the input, i is n - 1, idx1 is not -1, idx2 is n - 2, stdin contains no input.**

The code block reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the remaining integers to `l3`. It then appends a tuple containing `a3` and `l3` to the list `val`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `_`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `idx1`, and `idx2` remain unchanged. The only changes are the updated values of `a3` and `l3`, and the addition of a new tuple to the list `val`.
