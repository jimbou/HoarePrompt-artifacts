Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer greater than or equal to 2, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, _ is at least m - 2, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, a3 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is 0 or 1, p2 is 0 or 1, i is n - 1, val is an empty list, stdin contains no input. If the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, then l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, and l is a list of integers equal to l1 with a1 inserted at index idx2. Otherwise, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, and l is a list of integers equal to l2 with a2 inserted at index idx1.**
