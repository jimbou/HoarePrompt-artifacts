Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is at least 2, `_` is either 1 or a string, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is undefined, `l11` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a2` removed from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a1` removed from `l2`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `l3` is undefined, `idx1` is either -1 or `n - 1`, `idx2` is either -1 or `n - 1`, `i` is `n - 1`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `_`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, and `i` remain unchanged. However, `val` is now an empty list, which means that `a3` and `l3` are no longer defined since they were previously derived from the last tuple in `val`.
