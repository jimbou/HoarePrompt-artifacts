To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to continue. The loop head is `for (a3, l3) in val:`, which means we're iterating over the tuples in the `val` list.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `val` contains at least one tuple of `(a3, l3)`. To execute the loop again, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `a3`, `l3`, and `val`.

Since we've already processed the first tuple in `val`, we need to move on to the next tuple. Therefore, we can adjust the state as follows:

* `a3` is the first element of the second tuple in `val` (or the next tuple if there are more than two).
* `l3` is the second element of the second tuple in `val` (or the next tuple if there are more than two).
* `val` still contains at least one tuple, but we've moved on to the next one.

The other variables in the state, such as `t`, `m`, `n`, `_`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `l1`, `l2`, and `l`, do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 0, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is the first element of the second tuple in `val`, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `i` is `n` - 1, `val` contains at least one tuple, `l3` is the second element of the second tuple in `val`, `stdin` contains no input. If `idx1` < `idx2`, then `l2` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at `idx1`, and `l` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at `idx1`. If `idx1` >= `idx2`, then if `idx1` > `idx2`, `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, and `l` is a list of integers equal to `l1` with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`. Otherwise, if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, then `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, and `l` is a list of integers equal to `l1` with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`. Otherwise, `l2` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, and `l` is a list of integers equal to `l2` with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`. If `idx2` is -1 and `idx1` is not -1, then `idx1` is not -1 and `idx2` is `n` - 2, `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val`. If the current value of `l3` is equal to the list of integers in `l` excluding `a3`, then the program continues. Otherwise, 'no' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
