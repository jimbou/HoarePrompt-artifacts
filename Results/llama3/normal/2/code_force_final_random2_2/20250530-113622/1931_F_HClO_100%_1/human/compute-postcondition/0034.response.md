Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, idx1 is -1, idx2 is i, p1 is 0, p2 is 1, i is 0, and stdin contains the remaining input for the test cases.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `idx2` and `p2`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`, and the second line sets `p2` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
