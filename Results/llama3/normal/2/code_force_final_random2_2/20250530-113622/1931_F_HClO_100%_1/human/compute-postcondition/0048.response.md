Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `i` is 1. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is 1 and `p1` is 1. Otherwise, `idx2` is 1 and `p2` is 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the program execution is interrupted, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
