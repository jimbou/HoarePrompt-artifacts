To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `m`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `_` and `m`. If `_` is less than `m - 2`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3.

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 1. The value of `m` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `val` is a list containing a tuple `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is an integer, and `l3` is a list of integers**
