Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is at least `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined, `idx1` is not -1, and `idx2` is `n - 2`.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values except for `idx2`, which is now set to `n - 2`. The value of `idx1` remains unchanged, and since it was not -1 initially, its value is still not -1.
