The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `m`. If `_` is less than `m - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 and `m` remains the same.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is at least 2, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `i` is the current value of `n - 1`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined, stdin contains one less input.**
