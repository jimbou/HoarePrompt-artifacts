Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is at least 3, `_` is either 1 or a string, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is the first element of the third tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the third tuple in `val`, `l11` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a2` removed from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a1` removed from `l2`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, `i` is `n - 1`, `idx1` is not -1, `idx2` is `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code executes a break statement, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional statement we were in. The values of all variables remain unchanged, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside.
