Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `idx1` is either `i` or -1, `idx2` is either `i` or -1, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, and `i` is 0, and stdin contains the remaining input for the test cases. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are either `i` or -1, and `p1` and `p2` are either 1 or 0. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative or if `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
