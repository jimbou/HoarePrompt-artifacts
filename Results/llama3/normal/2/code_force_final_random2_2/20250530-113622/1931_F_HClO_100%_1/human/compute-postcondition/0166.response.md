Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is at least `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `i` is 3, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and we have exited the innermost control structure.
