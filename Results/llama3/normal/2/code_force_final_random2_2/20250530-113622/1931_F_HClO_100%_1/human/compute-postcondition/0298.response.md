Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, m is at least 2, _ is either 1 or a string, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, a3 is undefined, l11 is a list of integers with all occurrences of a2 removed from l1, l22 is a list of integers with all occurrences of a1 removed from l2, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is an empty list, l3 is undefined, i is n - 1, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at idx1, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at idx1.**

The code snippet modifies the list `l2` by inserting the value of `a2` at the index `idx1`. This change is then reflected in the variable `l`, which is assigned the modified list `l2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
