Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 0, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `i` is `n` - 1, `val` is a list containing at least 1 tuple of (`a3`, `l3`), `stdin` contains no input. If `idx1` < `idx2`, then `l2` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at `idx1`, and `l` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at `idx1`. If `idx1` >= `idx2`, then if `idx1` > `idx2`, `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, and `l` is a list of integers equal to `l1` with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`. Otherwise, if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, then `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, and `l` is a list of integers equal to `l1` with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`. Otherwise, `l2` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, and `l` is a list of integers equal to `l2` with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`. If `idx2` is -1 and `idx1` is not -1, then `idx1` is not -1 and `idx2` is `n` - 2, `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val`. The current value of `l3` is not equal to the list of integers in `l` excluding `a3`, and 'no' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. All variables retain their original values and properties, and the conditions and relationships between them remain unchanged. The only change is that the program execution breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement.
