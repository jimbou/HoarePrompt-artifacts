Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `idx1` is either `i` or -1, `idx2` is either `i` or -1, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, and `i` is 0, and stdin contains the remaining input for the test cases. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then the current value of `idx1` is `i`, `p1` is 1, and `idx2` and `p2` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the current value of `idx2` is `i`, `p2` is 1, and `idx1` and `p1` remain unchanged. Additionally, both `idx1` and `idx2` are greater than or equal to 0.***
