To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`, so we can only adjust the states of `_` and `m`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. If `m` is greater than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 3.

The variable `_` is the input from stdin, which contains no input. Since the loop is not dependent on the input, we don't need to adjust the state of `_`.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is at least 4, `_` is a string (the input from stdin), `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is the first element of the last tuple in `val`, `l11` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a2` removed from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a1` removed from `l2`, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `i` is `n` - 1, `val` contains at least `m` - 1 tuples, `l3` is the second element of the last tuple in `val`, stdin contains no input**
