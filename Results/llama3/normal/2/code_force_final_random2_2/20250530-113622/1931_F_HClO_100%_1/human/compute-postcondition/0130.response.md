Output State: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to `m`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is at least `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `i` is the current value of `n - 1`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined, stdin contains no input and we have consumed `m - 2` inputs from stdin which were empty.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that all variables not affected by the loop (`t`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `val`, `a3`, `l3`) remain unchanged. The loop variable `_` has reached its maximum value of `m - 2`, and the loop has consumed `m - 2` empty inputs from stdin.
