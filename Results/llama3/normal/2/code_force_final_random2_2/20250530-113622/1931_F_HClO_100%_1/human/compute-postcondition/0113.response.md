Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is the current value of `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `i` is the current value of `n - 1`, `val` is a list containing at least 3 tuples `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the third `a3` in the list, `l3` is the third `l3` in the list. If `l3` is not equal to the list of integers excluding `a3`, then 'no' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
