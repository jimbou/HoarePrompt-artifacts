Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is not less than `idx2` and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, stdin contains no input. If the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, then `l1` has `a1` inserted at `idx2` and `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at `idx2`. Otherwise, `l2` has `a2` inserted at `idx1` and `l` is a list of integers equal to `l2` with `a2` inserted at `idx1`.**
