Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, idx1 is i, idx2 is -1, p1 is 1, p2 is 0, and i is 0, and stdin contains the remaining input for the test cases.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `idx1` and sets `p1` to 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
