The only objects in the loop head are variables  `a3` and `l3` and list `val`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `val`.  If the list has at least 2 tuples the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `val` has at least 1 tuple, `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 tuples and the `a3` is the first element of the second tuple in `val` and `l3` is the second element of the second tuple in `val`.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is at least 3, `_` is either 1 or a string, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is the first element of the second tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the second tuple in `val`, `l11` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a2` removed from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers with all occurrences of `a1` removed from `l2`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing at least 2 tuples, `i` is `n - 1`, `idx1` is not -1, `idx2` is `n - 2`, and if `l3` is not equal to the list of integers in `l` excluding `a3`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
