Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `idx1` is either -1 or the index where `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, `idx2` is either -1 or the index where `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and `val` is an empty list.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `val` which is an empty list. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
