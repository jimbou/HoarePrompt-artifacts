Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than i + 2, m is at least 2, _ is either 1 or a string, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, a3 is the first element of the last tuple in val, l11 is a list of integers with all occurrences of a2 removed from l1, l22 is a list of integers with all occurrences of a1 removed from l2, val contains at least m - 1 tuples, l3 is the second element of the last tuple in val, i is increased by 1, idx1 is i, p1 is 1.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `idx1` and sets `p1` to 1. No other variables are affected. The value of `i` is increased by 1, but this change is not reflected in the output state as it is not explicitly mentioned in the code. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
