Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is at least 0, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined, `idx1` is not less than `idx2` and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, if `idx2` is -1 and `idx1` is not -1, then `idx1` is not -1 and `idx2` is `n - 2`, and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration due to the `continue` statement. All variables maintain their initial values and properties, and the conditions regarding `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged.
