Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, m is at least 2, _ is either 1 or a string, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, a3 is the first element of the last tuple in val, l11 is a list of integers with all occurrences of a2 removed from l1, l22 is a list of integers with all occurrences of a1 removed from l2, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val contains at least m - 1 tuples, l3 is the second element of the last tuple in val, idx1 is either -1 or n - 1, idx2 is either -1 or n - 1, i is n - 1.**

The loop will execute until `i` reaches `n - 1`. At this point, `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, and the loop will terminate. The values of `idx1` and `idx2` will be either `-1` or `n - 1`, depending on whether the conditions inside the loop were met. The values of `p1` and `p2` will be either `0` or `1`, depending on whether the conditions inside the loop were met. The values of the other variables will remain unchanged.
