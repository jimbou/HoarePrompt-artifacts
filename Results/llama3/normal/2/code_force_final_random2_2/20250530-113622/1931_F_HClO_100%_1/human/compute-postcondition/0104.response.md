To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for (a3, l3) in val:`. Therefore, we can only adjust the states of `a3`, `l3`, and `val`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `val` list. If the list has at least 2 tuples, the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `val` is a list containing at least 1 tuple `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first `a3` in the list, and `l3` is the first `l3` in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `val` must have at least 2 tuples, and `a3` and `l3` must be the second tuple in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is the current value of `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `i` is the current value of `n - 1`, `val` is a list containing at least 2 tuples `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the second `a3` in the list, `l3` is the second `l3` in the list.**
