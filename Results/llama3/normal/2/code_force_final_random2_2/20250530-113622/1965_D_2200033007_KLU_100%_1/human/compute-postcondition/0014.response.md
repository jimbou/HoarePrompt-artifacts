Output State: **`a` is a list of n elements where the middle index is equal to the third element in the list odds, the mirrored index is equal to the third element in the list odds, and the rest are zeros, `prev` is the second element in the list odds, `idx` is the middle index of a minus 2, `odds` is a list of positive integers with a length of (n+1)/2 that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is an odd positive integer, and `x` is the third element in the list odds.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `a` now has its middle index and its mirrored index equal to the third element in the list `odds`, and all other elements are zeros. The values of `prev`, `idx`, `odds`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged.
