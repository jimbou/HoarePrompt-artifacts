Output State: **a is a list of positive integers that must have at least n+2 elements, cts is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements of a with additional elements which are the sums of the first n elements of a and an additional element which is the sum of the first j+2 elements of a, i is 2, sm is equal to the sum of the first j+2 elements of a, j is 4**

The code snippet modifies the `sm` variable by adding the value of `a[j]` to it, and then appends this new value to the `cts` list. The value of `j` is 4, so `a[j]` refers to the fifth element of the list `a`. The sum of the first `j+1` elements of `a` is already stored in `sm`, so adding `a[j]` to `sm` effectively calculates the sum of the first `j+2` elements of `a`. This new sum is then appended to the `cts` list, which now contains the cumulative sums of the elements of `a` with additional elements which are the sums of the first `n` elements of `a` and an additional element which is the sum of the first `j+2` elements of `a`. The values of `a`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
