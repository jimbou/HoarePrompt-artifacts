Output State: **bigList and smallList are lists of integers, bigList is longer than smallList, smallList is empty, and the last element of bigList is not equal to the last element of smallList.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the lists bigList and smallList will still be lists of integers, and bigList will still be longer than smallList. However, smallList will be empty, and the last element of bigList will not be equal to the last element of smallList.
