To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the conditions in the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved accordingly. The loop head is:

`while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:`

This condition has two parts:

1. `len(smallList) > 0`
2. `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`

Given the initial state:

- `bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers.
- `bigList` is longer than `smallList`.
- The last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal.

To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to guarantee that both conditions are met.

1. For `len(smallList) > 0`, since `smallList` must have at least one element, its current state already implies this condition can be met because it's described as a list of integers, which inherently suggests it has at least one element. However, to be explicit, we should note that `smallList` must not be empty.

2. For `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`, the given state already ensures this condition is met because it states the last elements of both lists are equal.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to explicitly state that `smallList` must not be empty to ensure `len(smallList) > 0`. The state of `bigList` and `smallList` being lists of integers and `bigList` being longer than `smallList` are already given and do not need adjustment for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers, `bigList` is longer than `smallList`, `smallList` is not empty, and the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal.**
