Output State: **a is a list of positive integers that must have at least n elements, cts is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements of a with additional elements which are the sums of the first n elements of a, i is n-1, sm is the sum of the nth element of a, j is n-1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `a` remains unchanged, the list `cts` contains the cumulative sums of the elements of `a` with additional elements which are the sums of the first `n` elements of `a`, the loop counter `i` is at its final value `n-1`, the sum `sm` is equal to the sum of the last element of `a`, and the inner loop counter `j` is at its final value `n-1`.
