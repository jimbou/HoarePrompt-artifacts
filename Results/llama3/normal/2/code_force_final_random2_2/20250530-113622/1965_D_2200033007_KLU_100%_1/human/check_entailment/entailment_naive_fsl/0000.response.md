Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. The problem description states that there is always at least one valid solution, and the program is designed to find one such solution.

The program first generates all possible subarray sums of the input array `a` using function `func_1`. It then removes duplicates from the list of sums using function `func_2`. The remaining sums are then used to construct the original array `a` using function `func_3`. The function `func_4` is not used in the program, but it seems to be a helper function to remove common elements from the end of two lists.

The program correctly handles the case where the input array `a` is a palindrome, and it correctly recovers the original array `a` from the given subarray sums. The program also correctly handles the case where the input array `a` has an odd length, and it correctly places the middle element of the array in the correct position.

The program does not have any obvious errors or edge cases that it does not handle. Therefore, based on the provided code and problem description, the program is correct.
