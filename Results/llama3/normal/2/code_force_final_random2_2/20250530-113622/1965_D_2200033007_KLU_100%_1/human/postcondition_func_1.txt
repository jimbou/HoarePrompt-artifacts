This function accepts a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing all elements from the input list, except for the last element that is equal to the last element of the output list. If an element is equal to the last element of the output list, it is removed from the output list. The function effectively filters out consecutive duplicate elements from the input list, returning a list of integers with no consecutive duplicates.
