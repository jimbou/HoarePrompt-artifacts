Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least n elements, `cts` is a sorted list containing the cumulative sums of the elements of `a` with additional elements which are the sums of the first n elements of `a`, `i` is n-1, `sm` is the sum of the nth element of `a`, `j` is n-1**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `cts` is now sorted in ascending order, while the other variables remain unchanged. The list `cts` still contains the cumulative sums of the elements of `a` with additional elements which are the sums of the first n elements of `a`, but now the elements are arranged in a sorted order.
