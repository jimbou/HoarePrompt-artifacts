Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of n zeros, prev is 0, idx is the middle index of a, odds is a list of positive integers with a length of (n+1)/2, n is an odd positive integer
Code of the loop:
for x in odds:
    if idx == n - 1 - idx:
        a[idx] = x
    else:
        a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
    prev = x
    idx = idx - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is a list of n elements where if the middle index is equal to its mirrored index, then the middle element is (x - prev) // 2 and the rest are zeros. Otherwise, the middle index and its mirrored index are equal to (x - prev) // 2 and the rest are 0. In both cases, prev is x, idx is the middle index of a minus 1, odds is a list of positive integers with a length of (n+1)/2 that must have at least 1 element, n is an odd positive integer, and x is the first element in the list odds.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: a is a list of n elements where if the middle index is equal to its mirrored index, then the middle element is x and the rest are zeros. Otherwise, the middle index and its mirrored index are equal to (x - prev) // 2 and the rest are 0. In both cases, prev is x, idx is the middle index of a minus 2, odds is a list of positive integers with a length of (n+1)/2 that must have at least 2 elements, n is an odd positive integer, and x is the second element in the list odds.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of n elements where if the middle index is equal to its mirrored index, then the middle element is the third element in the list odds and the rest are zeros. Otherwise, the middle index and its mirrored index are equal to (the third element in the list odds - the second element in the list odds) // 2 and the rest are 0. `prev` is the third element in the list odds, `idx` is the middle index of `a` minus 3, `odds` is a list of positive integers with a length of (n+1)/2 that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is an odd positive integer, and `x` is the third element in the list odds.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
