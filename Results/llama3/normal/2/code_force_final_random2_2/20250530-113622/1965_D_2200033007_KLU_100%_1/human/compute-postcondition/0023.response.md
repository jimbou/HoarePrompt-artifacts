The only objects in the loop head are variables  j, i and list  a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `a`. If `j` is less than `len(a)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `a` has at least `n+1` elements. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 3, and `a` must have at least `n+2` elements.
State: **`a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least n+2 elements, `cts` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements of `a` with additional elements which are the sums of the first `n` elements of `a` and an additional element which is the sum of the first `j` elements of `a`, `i` is 2, `sm` is equal to the sum of the first `j` elements of `a`, `j` is 3**
