Output State: **a is a list of n elements where if the middle index is equal to its mirrored index, then the middle element is the last element in the list odds and the rest are zeros. Otherwise, the middle index and its mirrored index are equal to (the last element in the list odds - the second last element in the list odds) // 2 and the rest are 0. prev is the last element in the list odds, idx is the middle index of a minus (n+1)/2, odds is an empty list, n is an odd positive integer, and x is the last element in the list odds.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the list `a` will have its middle index and its mirrored index set to the last element in the list `odds` if the middle index is equal to its mirrored index, or to half the difference between the last two elements in `odds` otherwise. The rest of the elements in `a` will be zeros. The variable `prev` will be set to the last element in `odds`, `idx` will be set to the middle index of `a` minus half the length of `a`, and `odds` will be an empty list. The variables `n` and `x` will remain unchanged.
