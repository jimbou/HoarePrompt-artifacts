To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `bigList` and `smallList` based on the conditions in the loop head.

1. `len(smallList) > 0`: This condition requires that `smallList` is not empty. Since `smallList` is already not empty and is one element shorter than its original length, we need to ensure it still has at least one element. This means the original length of `smallList` must have been at least 2, so it can be one element shorter and still satisfy this condition.

2. `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`: This condition requires that the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal. Since they are already equal and both lists are one element shorter than their original lengths, we need to ensure that removing one more element from each list will still result in equal last elements. This implies that the second-to-last elements of the original lists must also be equal.

Considering these adjustments, the modified state is:

State: **`bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers, `bigList` is longer than `smallList`, `smallList` is not empty and its original length was at least 2, the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal, and the second-to-last elements of the original `bigList` and `smallList` are also equal**
