Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: bigList and smallList are lists of integers, bigList is longer than smallList, and the last elements of bigList and smallList are equal.
Code of the loop:
while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
    bigList.pop()
    smallList.pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: bigList and smallList are lists of integers, bigList is longer than smallList, smallList is not empty, and the last elements of bigList and smallList are equal, bigList and smallList are both one element shorter than their original lengths.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: bigList and smallList are lists of integers, bigList is longer than smallList, smallList is not empty and its original length was at least 1, the last elements of bigList and smallList are equal, and the second-to-last elements of the original bigList and smallList are also equal
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: bigList and smallList are lists of integers, bigList is longer than smallList, smallList has at least 1 element, the last elements of bigList and smallList are equal.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
