To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions in the `while` loop statement:

1. `len(smallList) > 0`
2. `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers
* `bigList` is longer than `smallList`
* `smallList` is not empty and its original length was at least 1
* The last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal
* The second-to-last elements of the original `bigList` and `smallList` are also equal

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `smallList` and the last elements of both lists.

* `smallList` must have at least one more element, so its length must be greater than 0. Since its original length was at least 1, we can conclude that `smallList` must have at least 2 elements.
* The last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` must remain equal.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers, `bigList` is longer than `smallList`, `smallList` has at least 2 elements, the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal**
