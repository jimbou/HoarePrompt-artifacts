Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of n elements where if the middle index is equal to its mirrored index, then the middle element is the third element in the list odds and the rest are zeros. Otherwise, the middle index and its mirrored index are equal to (the third element in the list odds - the second element in the list odds) // 2 and the rest are 0. In both cases, `prev` is the second element in the list odds, `idx` is the middle index of `a` minus 2, `odds` is a list of positive integers with a length of (n+1)/2 that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is an odd positive integer, and `x` is the third element in the list odds.***
