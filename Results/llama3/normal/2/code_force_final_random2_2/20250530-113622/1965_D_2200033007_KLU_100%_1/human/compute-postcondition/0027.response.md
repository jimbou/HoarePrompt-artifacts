Output State: **a is a list of positive integers that must have at least n+1 elements, cts is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements of a with additional elements which are the sums of the first n elements of a and an additional element which is the sum of all elements of a, i is 2, sm is equal to the sum of all elements of a, j is equal to the length of a**

The loop will execute until `j` reaches the length of `a`. At this point, `sm` will be the sum of all elements in `a`, and `cts` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements of `a` with additional elements which are the sums of the first `n` elements of `a` and an additional element which is the sum of all elements of `a`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2.
