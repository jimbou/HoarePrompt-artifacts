Output State: **a is a list of positive integers that must have at least n+1 elements, cts is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements of a with additional elements which are the sums of the first n elements of a and an additional element which is the sum of the first j elements of a, i is 2, sm is equal to the sum of the first j elements of a, j is 2**

In this output state, the list `cts` has been updated to include an additional element, which is the sum of the first `j` elements of `a`. The variable `sm` now holds the sum of the first `j` elements of `a`. The values of `a`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
