To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is: `for j in range(i, len(a)):`

The variables involved in the loop head are `j`, `i`, and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `len(a)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 3, and `a` has at least `n+2` elements.

To adjust the states for the next iteration, we need to increment `j` by 1, so `j` becomes 4. The length of `a` remains the same, but we need to ensure that it still has at least `n+2` elements.

The other variables `cts`, `sm`, and `i` are not directly involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least `n+2` elements, `cts` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements of `a` with additional elements which are the sums of the first `n` elements of `a` and an additional element which is the sum of the first `j+1` elements of `a`, `i` is 2, `sm` is equal to the sum of the first `j+1` elements of `a`, `j` is 4**
