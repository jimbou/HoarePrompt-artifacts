Output State: **`a` is a list of n elements where the middle index is equal to x and the rest are zeros, `prev` is x, `idx` is the middle index of a minus 1, `odds` is a list of positive integers with a length of (n+1)/2 that must have at least 2 elements, `n` is an odd positive integer, and `x` is the second element in the list odds.**

In this output state, the value of `a[idx]` has been updated to `x`, which means the middle index of the list `a` now holds the value of `x`. The rest of the elements in the list `a` remain zeros. The values of the other variables, including `prev`, `idx`, `odds`, `n`, and `x`, remain unchanged.
