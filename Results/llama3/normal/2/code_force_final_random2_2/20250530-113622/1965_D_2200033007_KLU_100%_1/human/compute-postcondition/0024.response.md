Output State: **a is a list of positive integers that must have at least n+2 elements, cts is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements of a with additional elements which are the sums of the first n elements of a and an additional element which is the sum of the first j+1 elements of a, i is 2, sm is equal to the sum of the first j+1 elements of a, j is 3**

The code modifies the `sm` variable by adding the value of the element at index `j` in the list `a` to it. Since `j` is 3, `sm` becomes the sum of the first 4 elements of `a`. The code then appends this new value of `sm` to the list `cts`. The list `cts` now contains the cumulative sums of the elements of `a` with additional elements which are the sums of the first `n` elements of `a` and an additional element which is the sum of the first `j+1` elements of `a`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
