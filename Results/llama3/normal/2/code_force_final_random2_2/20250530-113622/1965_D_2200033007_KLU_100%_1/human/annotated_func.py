    #State: a is a list of positive integers that must have at least n elements, cts is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements of a with additional elements which are the sums of the first n elements of a, i is n-1, sm is the sum of the nth element of a, j is n-1
    cts.sort()
    return cts
    #The program returns a sorted list containing the cumulative sums of the elements of list 'a' with additional elements which are the sums of the first n elements of 'a'

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns a sorted list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in the input list, including additional elements that are the sums of the first n elements of the input list, where n is the length of the input list. The function does not modify the input list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: cts is a list of integers.

    for ct in cts:
        if len(odds) > 0 and ct == odds[-1]:
            odds.pop()

    #State: `cts` is a list of integers, `odds` is a list of integers that contains all the elements of `cts` that are not equal to the last element of `odds`
    return odds
    #The program returns a list of integers that contains all the elements of `cts` except the last element of `odds`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function accepts a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing all elements from the input list, except for the last element that is equal to the last element of the output list. If an element is equal to the last element of the output list, it is removed from the output list. The function effectively filters out consecutive duplicate elements from the input list, returning a list of integers with no consecutive duplicates.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: odds is a list of positive integers, n is a positive integer such that n is odd and the length of odds is equal to (n+1)/2.
    a = [0] * n

    idx = (n - 1) // 2
    for x in odds:
        if idx == n - 1 - idx:
            a[idx] = x
        else:
            a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
            a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        
        prev = x
        
        idx = idx - 1
        
    #State: a is a list of n elements where if the middle index is equal to its mirrored index, then the middle element is the last element in the list odds and the rest are zeros. Otherwise, the middle index and its mirrored index are equal to (the last element in the list odds - the second last element in the list odds) // 2 and the rest are 0. prev is the last element in the list odds, idx is the middle index of a minus (n+1)/2, odds is an empty list, n is an odd positive integer, and x is the last element in the list odds.
    return a
    #The program returns a list of n elements where if the middle index is equal to its mirrored index, then the middle element is the last element in the list odds and the rest are zeros. Otherwise, the middle index and its mirrored index are equal to (the last element in the list odds - the second last element in the list odds) // 2 and the rest are 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a list of n elements based on the input list 'odds' and the positive odd integer 'n'. It calculates the middle index and its mirrored index in the output list, and assigns values to these indices based on the last and second last elements of the input list 'odds'. If the middle index is equal to its mirrored index, the middle element is set to the last element of 'odds' and the rest are zeros. Otherwise, the middle index and its mirrored index are set to half the difference between the last and second last elements of 'odds', and the rest are zeros. The function returns the generated list of n elements.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: bigList and smallList are lists of integers, bigList is longer than smallList, and the last elements of bigList and smallList are equal.
    while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
        bigList.pop()

    #State: bigList and smallList are lists of integers, bigList is longer than smallList, smallList is empty, and the last element of bigList is not equal to the last element of smallList.
    return bigList[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the list 'bigList'.

#Overall this is what the function does:Removes common trailing elements from two lists and returns the last element of the longer list.
