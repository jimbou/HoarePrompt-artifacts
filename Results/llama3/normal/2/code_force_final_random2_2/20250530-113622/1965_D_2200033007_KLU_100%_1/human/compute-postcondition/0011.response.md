Postcondition: ***a is a list of n elements where if the middle index is equal to its mirrored index, then the middle element is x and the rest are zeros. Otherwise, the middle index and its mirrored index are equal to (x - prev) // 2 and the rest are 0. In both cases, prev is x, idx is the middle index of a minus 1, odds is a list of positive integers with a length of (n+1)/2 that must have at least 2 elements, n is an odd positive integer, and x is the second element in the list odds.***
