To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j`, `i`, and `a`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:


1. The loop will execute if `i` is less than the length of `a`. Since `a` must have at least `n+1` elements, we can infer that `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.
2. The loop will start from the value of `i`, which is currently 2. So, `j` will start from 2.
3. Since `j` will iterate from `i` to the length of `a`, we need to ensure that `a` has at least `i+1` elements. Given that `a` must have at least `n+1` elements, this condition is already satisfied.


Considering these points, the adjusted state is:


State: **`a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least `n+1` elements, `cts` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements of `a` with additional elements which are the sums of the first `n` elements of `a`, `i` is 2 and must be less than or equal to `n`, `sm` is 0, `j` is 2**
