Output State: **bigList and smallList are lists of integers, bigList is longer than smallList, smallList is not empty, and the last elements of bigList and smallList are equal, bigList and smallList are both one element shorter than their original lengths.**

In this output state, I have maintained all the valid information from the precondition, including the fact that bigList and smallList are lists of integers, bigList is longer than smallList, and smallList is not empty. I have also updated the state to reflect the changes made by the code, specifically that both bigList and smallList are now one element shorter than their original lengths, and the last elements of both lists are still equal.
