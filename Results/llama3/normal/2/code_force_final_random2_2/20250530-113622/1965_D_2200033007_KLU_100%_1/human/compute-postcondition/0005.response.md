Output State: **bigList and smallList are lists of integers, bigList is longer than smallList, smallList has at least 1 element, the last elements of bigList and smallList are equal.**

The code snippet consists of two lines, each removing the last element from `bigList` and `smallList`, respectively. Since the last elements of both lists were equal before the code execution, removing them will not change their relative lengths or the equality of their last elements. However, `smallList` will now have at least 1 element, as one element has been removed from it. The lengths of both lists are reduced by 1, but their relative order and the equality of their last elements remain unchanged.
