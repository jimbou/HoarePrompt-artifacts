Postcondition: ***a is a list containing two strings, n is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, _ is 2, the integer 2 is at least 1, s is a string containing a[0][0], a[0][1], ..., a[0][i], and a[1][i], where i is the smallest integer such that a[0][i + 1] is '1' and a[1][i] is '0', and x is i, or if no such i exists, then s is a string containing a[0] and a[1][n - 1], and x is n - 1, and i is n - 1, and t is 1, i is 0, x must be greater than 0. The current value of a[0] up to index i + 1 is equal to the current value of s up to index i + 1***
