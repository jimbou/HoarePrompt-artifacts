According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and the integer `2`. If `_` is less than `2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `2` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1, so `_` is 2. The integer `2` remains the same.
State: **`a` is a list containing two strings, `n` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `_` is 2, the integer `2` is at least 1**
