Output State: **`a` is a list containing two strings, `n` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `_` is 1, the integer `2` is at least 1**

In this output state, the list `a` now contains two strings because the `input()` function reads a string from the standard input and appends it to the list `a`. The number of test cases in the standard input has decreased by one, so it now contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. The values of the other variables, `n`, `_`, and `2`, remain unchanged.
