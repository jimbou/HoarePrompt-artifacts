Output: **a is a list containing two strings, n is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, _ is 2, the integer 2 is at least 1, s is a string containing a[0][0], a[0][1], ..., a[0][i], and a[1][i], where i is the smallest integer such that a[0][i + 1] is '1' and a[1][i] is '0', and x is i, or if no such i exists, then s is a string containing a[0] and a[1][n - 1], and x is n - 1, and i is n - 1, and t is 1 if a[0][:i + 1] equals s[:i + 1], otherwise t is x - i + 1, i is x - 1, x must be greater than or equal to 0, and s is printed without any separator, and t is printed, where t is either 1 if a[0][:i + 1] equals s[:i + 1], otherwise t is x - i + 1**
