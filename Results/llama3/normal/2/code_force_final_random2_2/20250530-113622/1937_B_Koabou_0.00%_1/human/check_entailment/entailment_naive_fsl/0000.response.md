Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the lexicographically smallest string is not a prefix of the first row. For example, consider the input:

3
2
10
01

The lexicographically smallest string is "001", but the program will output "100" as the smallest string, which is incorrect.

The issue is that the program only checks if the first row has a '1' followed by a '0' in the second row, and if so, it breaks and constructs the smallest string by concatenating the first row up to that point and the second row from that point onwards. However, this approach does not consider the case where the lexicographically smallest string is not a prefix of the first row.

To fix this, the program needs to be modified to consider all possible paths and find the lexicographically smallest string among them.
