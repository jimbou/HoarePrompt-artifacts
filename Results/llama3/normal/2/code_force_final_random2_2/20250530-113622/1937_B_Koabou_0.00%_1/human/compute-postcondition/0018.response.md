Postcondition: ***a is a list containing two strings, n is an integer that is at least 3, _ is 2, the integer 2 is at least 1, i is 2. If a[0][i + 1] is '1' and a[1][i] is '0', then s is a string containing a[0][0], a[0][1], a[0][2], and a[1][0] and x is 2. Otherwise, s is an empty list and x is 0.***
