Output State: **a is an empty list, n is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

The first line initializes an empty list `a`. The second line assigns the integer value of the first input to `n`. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing three inputs, the first input is an integer. After reading this integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. No other variables are affected.
