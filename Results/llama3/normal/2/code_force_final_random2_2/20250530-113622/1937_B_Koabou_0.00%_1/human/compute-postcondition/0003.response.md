The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and the integer `2`. If `_` is less than `2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and the integer `2` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1, so `_` is 1, and the integer `2` is still at least 1.
State: **`a` is a list containing one string, `n` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `_` is 1, the integer `2` is at least 1**
