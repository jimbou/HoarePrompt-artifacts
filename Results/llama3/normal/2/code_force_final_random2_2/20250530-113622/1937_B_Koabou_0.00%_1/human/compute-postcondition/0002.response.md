Output State: **`a` is a list containing one string, `n` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `_` is 0, the integer `2` is at least 1**

In this output state, the list `a` now contains one string that was input from the user, which was previously empty. The other variables remain unchanged, with `n` still being an integer, `_` being 0, and the integer `2` being at least 1. The stdin now contains one less test case than before, as one test case has been consumed by the `input()` function.
