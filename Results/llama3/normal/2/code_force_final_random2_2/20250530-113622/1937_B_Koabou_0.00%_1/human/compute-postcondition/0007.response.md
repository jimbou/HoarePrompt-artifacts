Output State: **`a` is a list containing two strings, `n` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `_` is 2, the integer `2` is at least 1**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `a` will contain two strings, the integer `n` remains unchanged, the standard input (stdin) will have two fewer test cases, the loop variable `_` will be 2, and the integer 2 will still be at least 1.
