Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and two binary strings of length n. It then finds the smallest index i such that the first string's (i+1)th character is '1' and the second string's ith character is '0'. If such an index exists, it constructs a new string s by concatenating the first i+1 characters of the first string and the ith character onwards of the second string. If no such index exists, it constructs s by concatenating the entire first string and the last character of the second string. The function then finds the length of the longest prefix of s that is equal to the corresponding prefix of the first string. Finally, it prints the constructed string s and the length of the longest matching prefix.**
