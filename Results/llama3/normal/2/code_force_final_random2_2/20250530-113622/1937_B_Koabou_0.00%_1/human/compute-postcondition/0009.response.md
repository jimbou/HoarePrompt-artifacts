The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and `i` is now 0.

State: **a is a list containing two strings, n is an integer that is at least 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, _ is 2, the integer 2 is at least 1, s is an empty list, x is 0, i is 0**
