Output State: `_` is equal to the initial value of `t`, stdin is empty, `s` is not defined.

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop counter `_` will be equal to the initial number of test cases `t`, the standard input `stdin` will be empty because all input strings have been processed, and the variable `s` will no longer be defined because it is only defined within the scope of the loop.
