Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input string is "ab", the program will output "Yes" and then print "ba", which is correct. However, if the input string is "abc", the program will output "Yes" and then print a random permutation of "abc", which may or may not be different from the original string. If the random permutation happens to be the same as the original string, the program will incorrectly output "Yes" and then print the original string, which does not meet the problem's requirement of outputting a string that is not equal to the original string.

In the case where the input string is "abc" and the random permutation is the same as the original string, the program will output "Yes" and then print "abc", which is incorrect because "abc" is equal to the original string. This is a case where the program does not work correctly, so the correctness is **False**.
