Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of rearranging the characters of a given string to form a new string that is not equal to the original string. The program uses a simple approach by first checking if the length of the string is 1 or if all characters in the string are the same. If either condition is true, it prints 'No' because it's impossible to rearrange the string to form a new string that is not equal to the original string.

If the string has more than one character and not all characters are the same, the program uses the `random.sample` function to randomly rearrange the characters of the string. If the rearranged string is the same as the original string (which can happen if the random rearrangement coincidentally results in the same string), the program simply moves the first character to the end of the string to ensure that the rearranged string is different from the original string.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly identifies when it's impossible to rearrange the string and prints 'No' in such cases. When it's possible to rearrange the string, it prints 'Yes' followed by the rearranged string.

Correctness: **True**
