According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and the input. If the input is an integer, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. So for the loop to be executed  the input must be an integer and the _ is 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, _ is 0**
