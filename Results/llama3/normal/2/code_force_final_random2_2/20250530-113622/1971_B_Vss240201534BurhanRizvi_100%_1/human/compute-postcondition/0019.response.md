Postcondition: **`s` is an integer (1 <= s <= 1000), stdin contains s strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, _ is 0. If `s` is 1, 'No' is printed. If `s` is not equal to 1, and all characters in `s` are the same and the length of `s` is greater than 1, 'No' is printed. Otherwise, a string `s2` is formed by randomly rearranging the characters of the strings in stdin, with a length of at most 10*s. If `s` is equal to `s2`, the first character of `s` is moved to the end of `s` to form `s2`, 'Yes' is printed, and `s2` is printed.**
