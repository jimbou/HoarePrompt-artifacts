Output State: **`s` is an integer (1 <= s <= 1000), stdin contains s strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, _ is 0, and s is not equal to 1. Either the length of the set of strings is not equal to 1 or the length of the set of strings is 1 but the length of the set of strings is 1, `s2` is a string consisting of the characters of the strings in stdin, in a random order, with a length of at most 10*s.**

In this output state, the value of `s2` is a string that consists of the characters of the strings in stdin, but in a random order. The length of `s2` is at most 10*s, because each string in stdin has a length of at most 10, and there are s strings. The other variables, `s` and `_`, remain unchanged.
