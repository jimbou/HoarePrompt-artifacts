Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, `_` is 1, stdin contains s-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the length of `s` is 1, 'No' is printed. If the length of `s` is more than 1 and all characters in `s` are the same, 'No' is printed. Otherwise, a string `s2` is created with the same characters as `s` but in a random order. If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is a string consisting of the same characters as `s` but in a circularly shifted order, 'Yes' is printed, and the string `s2` is printed.***
