Postcondition: **`s` is an integer (1 <= s <= 1000), stdin contains s strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, _ is 0, and s is not equal to 1. Either the length of the set of strings is not equal to 1 or the length of the set of strings is 1 but the length of the set of strings is 1. `s2` is a string consisting of the characters of the strings in stdin, in a random order, with a length of at most 10*s. The current value of `s` is equal to the current value of `s2`.**
