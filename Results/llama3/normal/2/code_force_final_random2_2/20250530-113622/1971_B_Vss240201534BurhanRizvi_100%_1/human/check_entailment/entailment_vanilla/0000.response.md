Reasoning:

1. The program first checks if the length of the input string `s` is 1. If it is, it prints 'No' because there is no way to rearrange a single character to form a different string.

2. If the length of `s` is more than 1, it checks if all characters in `s` are the same (i.e., `len(set(s)) == 1`). If they are, it prints 'No' because there is no way to rearrange a string of identical characters to form a different string.

3. If `s` has more than one distinct character, the program generates a random permutation of `s` using `random.sample(s, len(s))`. If this permutation happens to be the same as the original string `s`, it simply rotates the string by moving the first character to the end.

4. In all cases where a different string can be formed, the program prints 'Yes' followed by the rearranged string.

Based on this reasoning, the program correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
