Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, `_` is 2, stdin contains s-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If `s` consists of the same character repeated one or more times and has a length greater than 1, then 'No' is printed. Otherwise, a string `s2` is created consisting of the same characters as `s` but in a random order. If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is modified to have the first character moved to the end. Otherwise, no changes are made. In either case, 'Yes' is printed, and the modified string `s2` is printed.***
