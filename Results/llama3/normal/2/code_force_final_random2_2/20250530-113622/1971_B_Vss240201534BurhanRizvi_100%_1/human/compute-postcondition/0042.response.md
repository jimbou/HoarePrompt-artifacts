Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, `_` is 2, `s2` is a string consisting of the same characters as `s` but with the first character moved to the end, stdin contains s-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10.**

In this output state, the value of `s2` has been updated to be a string consisting of the same characters as `s`, but with the first character moved to the end. For example, if `s` was "hello", `s2` would now be "elloh". The values of `s` and `_` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains s-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10.
