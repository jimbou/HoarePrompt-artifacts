Functionality: **This function reads a specified number of strings from standard input, checks each string for uniqueness of characters, and prints either 'No' if the string has only one unique character or all characters are the same, or 'Yes' followed by a modified version of the string where the first character is moved to the end if the shuffled string is identical to the original. After processing all input strings, the function leaves the standard input empty.**
