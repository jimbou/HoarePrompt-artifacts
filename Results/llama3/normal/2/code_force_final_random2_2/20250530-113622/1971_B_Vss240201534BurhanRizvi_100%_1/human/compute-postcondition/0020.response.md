The only objects in the loop head are variables  _ and s, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _.  If the variable _ is less than s the loop executes again for the next time. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, s is an integer (1 <= s <= 1000), stdin contains s strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. So for the loop to be executed one more time the variable _ is 1 and s is an integer (1 <= s <= 1000), stdin contains s strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10.
State: **`s` is an integer (1 <= s <= 1000), stdin contains s strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, _ is 1**
