Output State: `_` is equal to the initial value of `t`, stdin is empty.

The loop will execute for the number of times specified by the initial value of `t`. After each iteration, the loop will consume one string from the input and print either 'No' or 'Yes' followed by a modified string. Once all strings have been consumed, the loop will terminate, leaving stdin empty. The value of `_` will be equal to the initial value of `t`, indicating the number of iterations that have taken place.
