Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    s = input()
    if len(s) == 1:
        print('No')
    elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
        print('No')
    else:
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s == s2:
            s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
        print('Yes')
        print(s2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is an integer (1 <= s <= 1000), stdin contains s strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, _ is 0. If `s` is 1, 'No' is printed. If `s` is not equal to 1, and all characters in `s` are the same and the length of `s` is greater than 1, 'No' is printed. Otherwise, a string `s2` is formed by randomly rearranging the characters of the strings in stdin, with a length of at most 10*s. If `s` is equal to `s2`, the first character of `s` is moved to the end of `s` to form `s2`, 'Yes' is printed, and `s2` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, `_` is 1, stdin contains s-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the length of `s` is 1, 'No' is printed. If the length of `s` is more than 1 and all characters in `s` are the same, 'No' is printed. Otherwise, a string `s2` is created with the same characters as `s` but in a random order. If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is a string consisting of the same characters as `s` but in a circularly shifted order, 'Yes' is printed, and the string `s2` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, `_` is 2, stdin contains s-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the length of `s` is 1, then 'No' is printed. If the length of `s` is greater than 1 and `s` consists of the same character repeated one or more times, then 'No' is printed. Otherwise, a string `s2` is created consisting of the same characters as `s` but in a random order. If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is modified to have the first character moved to the end. Otherwise, no changes are made. In either case, 'Yes' is printed, and the modified string `s2` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
