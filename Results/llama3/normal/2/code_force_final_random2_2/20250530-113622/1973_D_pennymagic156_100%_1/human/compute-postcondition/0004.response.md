Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, `v` is the return value of `func_2()`, `i` is `n`, and this is printed: "? 1 [n * n]"**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as positive integers. The value of `v` is updated to the return value of the function `func_2()`, which is unknown. The value of `i` remains `n`. Additionally, the expression "? 1 [n * n]" is printed, where `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.
