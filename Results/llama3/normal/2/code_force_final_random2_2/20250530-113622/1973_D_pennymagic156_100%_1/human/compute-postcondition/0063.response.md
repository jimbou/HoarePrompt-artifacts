The variables in the loop head are `cnt` and `l` and `n`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `cnt` and `l` and `n`. If `cnt` is not zero and `l` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` is `k` and `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0. `cnt` is `k` and `k` must be greater than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `cnt` is `k` and `k` must be greater than 1. `l` is 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `l` is 2. `n` must be greater than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` must be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`cnt` is `k` and `k` must be greater than 1, `l` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, and this is printed: "? 1 2 * v" and the string "? 1 4 * v" is printed where v is a variable whose value is not specified in the precondition**
