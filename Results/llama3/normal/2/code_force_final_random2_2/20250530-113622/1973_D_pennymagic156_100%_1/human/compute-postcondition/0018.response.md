Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is equal to n, v is equal to n-2, i is equal to n-2, and this is printed: "? 1 ((n-2) * n)"**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `v = i` and `break`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `v`, and the second line is a break statement that does not affect any variables.

Initially, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is equal to `n`, `v` is equal to the returned value of `func_2()`, `i` is equal to `n-2`, and the string "? 1 ((n-2) * n)" is printed.

After executing the code, the value of `v` is updated to be equal to `i`, which is `n-2`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The printed string also remains the same.

Therefore, the final output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is equal to `n`, `v` is equal to `n-2`, `i` is equal to `n-2`, and the string "? 1 ((n-2) * n)" is printed.
