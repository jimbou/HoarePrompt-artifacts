Based on the precondition, we know that `n` and `k` are positive integers. The value of `i` is determined by the return value of `func_2()`. If the return value is equal to `n`, then `n`, `k`, `v`, and `i` are all equal to `n`. Otherwise, `i` is equal to `n-1`.

Since we don't know the return value of `func_2()`, we can't determine the exact value of `i`. However, we can describe the possible values of `i` based on the precondition.

If the return value of `func_2()` is equal to `n`, then `i` is equal to `n`. In this case, the print statement will output:

`? 1 n * n`

If the return value of `func_2()` is not equal to `n`, then `i` is equal to `n-1`. In this case, the print statement will output:

`? 1 (n-1) * n`

Since we can't determine the exact value of `i`, we can't provide a single output value. However, we can describe the possible outputs based on the precondition.

Output: **? 1 n * n or ? 1 (n-1) * n (where n is a positive integer)**
