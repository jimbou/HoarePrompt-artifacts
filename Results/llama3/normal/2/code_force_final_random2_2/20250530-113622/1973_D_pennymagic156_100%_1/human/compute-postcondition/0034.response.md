Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 2 (or at least 3), k is equal to n, i is 0, cnt is equal to n - 3, l is equal to func_2() + 1 and l must be less than n + 1, and this is printed: "? 1 0", and this is printed: "? l 0", and this is printed: "? l 0"**

The code executes two lines. The first line assigns the value of `func_2() + 1` to `l`, but since `l` already has this value, this line does not change the value of `l`. The second line decrements `cnt` by 1, making `cnt` equal to `n - 3`. No other variables are affected.
