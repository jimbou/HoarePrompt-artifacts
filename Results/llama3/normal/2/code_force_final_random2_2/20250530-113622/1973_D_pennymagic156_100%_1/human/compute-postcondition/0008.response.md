The only variable in the loop head is variable i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n` or `n` is greater than `i`. For the loop to execute again `i` must be decreased by 1.
State: **n and k are positive integers. If the return value of func_2() is equal to n, then n, k, v, and i are all equal to n. Otherwise, no changes are made and i is equal to n-1**
