To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is: `for i in range(1, n // k + 1):`

The variables involved are `i`, `n`, and `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:

* `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`
* `k` is equal to `n`
* `i` is 0

To execute the loop again, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 1.

Since `k` is equal to `n`, we can substitute `k` with `n` in the loop head. The loop head becomes: `for i in range(1, n // n + 1):`

Simplifying the loop head, we get: `for i in range(1, 1 + 1):`

This means the loop will execute again if `i` is less than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `i` is 1
* `n` is still a positive integer greater than or equal to `k` (since `k` is equal to `n`)
* `k` is still equal to `n`

The other variables `cnt`, `l`, and the printed statements are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is equal to `n`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is not equal to 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`, `l` is equal to `func_2() + 1` and `l` must be less than or equal to `n`, and this is printed: "? 1 0", and this is printed: "? `l` 0", and this is printed: "? `l` 0", ... (`n` times)**
