Let's analyze the given state and the for loop statement.

The for loop statement is: `for i in range(n, 0, -1):`

This means that the loop will iterate from `n` down to `1` in reverse order, decrementing `i` by `1` in each iteration.

Now, let's consider the given state:

* If the return value of `func_2()` is equal to `n`, then `n`, `k`, `v`, and `i` are all equal to `n`.
* Otherwise, if `v` is equal to `n`, then `v` is equal to `n-1`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `k` is equal to `n`, and `n` is a positive integer.
* Otherwise, no changes are made and `i` is equal to `n-1`, and this is printed: `? 1 [i * n]` where `i` is equal to `n-1` and `n` is a positive integer.

Since we are only concerned with the state at the start of the next iteration, we can ignore the printing statement.

From the given state, we can see that `i` is either equal to `n` or `n-1`. Since the loop iterates in reverse order, `i` will be decremented by `1` in each iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be decremented by `1`. If `i` is currently equal to `n`, it should become `n-1`. If `i` is currently equal to `n-1`, it should become `n-2`.

The other variables `n`, `k`, and `v` are not affected by the loop iteration, so their values remain the same.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is equal to `n`, `v` is equal to `n-1`, `i` is equal to `n-2`**
