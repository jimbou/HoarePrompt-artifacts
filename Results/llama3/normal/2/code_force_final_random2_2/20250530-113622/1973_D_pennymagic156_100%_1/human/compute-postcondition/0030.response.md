Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is equal to n, i is 0, cnt is equal to n - 2, l is equal to func_2() + 1, and this is printed: "? 1 0", and this is printed: "? l 0"**

The code modifies the values of `l` and `cnt`. The first line assigns the value of `func_2() + 1` to `l`, and the second line decrements `cnt` by 1. The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The output state includes the updated values of `l` and `cnt`, as well as the unchanged values of `n`, `k`, and `i`. The printed statements remain the same.
