Output State: **If the return value of func_2() is equal to n, then n, k, v, and i are all equal to n. Otherwise, no changes are made and i is equal to n-1, and this is printed: ? 1 [i * n] where i is equal to n-1 and n is a positive integer**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

If the return value of func_2() is equal to n, then all variables n, k, v, and i are updated to be equal to n. However, if the return value of func_2() is not equal to n, then no changes are made to the variables, and the value of i remains n-1. Additionally, the expression ? 1 [i * n] is printed, where i is equal to n-1 and n is a positive integer.
