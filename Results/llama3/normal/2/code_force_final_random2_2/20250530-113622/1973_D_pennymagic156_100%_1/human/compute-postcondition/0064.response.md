Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `l` is 2, so the string will contain the value 2.
* `i` is 2, so the string will contain the value 2 multiplied by `v`, which is a variable whose value is not specified in the precondition.
* The string is printed with the `flush=True` argument, which means that the output will be immediately flushed to the output buffer.

Therefore, the output will be a string that contains the value 2, the result of multiplying 2 by `v`, and the string "* v".

Output: **? 2 [2 * v] * v (where v is the value of the variable v)**
