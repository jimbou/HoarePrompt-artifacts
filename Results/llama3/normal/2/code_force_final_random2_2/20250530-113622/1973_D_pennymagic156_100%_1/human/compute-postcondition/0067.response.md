Output State: **cnt is 0, l is n + 1, i is 2, n // k + 1 is greater than 2, and the strings "? 1 2 * v", "? 1 4 * v", "? 2 2 * v", ..., "? n 2 * v" are printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the counter `cnt` will be 0, the variable `l` will be equal to `n + 1`, the variable `i` will remain 2, and the condition `n // k + 1` will still be greater than 2. Additionally, the loop will have printed a series of strings in the format "? x 2 * v" where `x` ranges from 1 to `n`.
