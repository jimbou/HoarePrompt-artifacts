To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head: `cnt and l < n + 1`.

Given the initial states:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`
- `k` is equal to `n`
- `i` is 0
- `cnt` is equal to `n`
- `l` is 1

And the condition for `v` based on the return value of `func_2()` does not directly affect the loop's ability to execute the first time, as it does not influence `cnt` or `l`.

The loop will execute if both conditions are met:
1. `cnt` is truthy (non-zero).
2. `l` is less than `n + 1`.

Given that `cnt` is equal to `n`, and `n` is a positive integer, `cnt` will always be truthy, satisfying the first condition.

For the second condition, since `l` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k` (and `k` equals `n`), `n + 1` will always be greater than 1. Therefore, `l < n + 1` is also satisfied.

Since both conditions are met with the given states, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is equal to `n`, `i` is 0, `cnt` is equal to `n`, `l` is 1**
