Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is equal to `n`, `v` is equal to the returned value of `func_2()`, `i` is equal to `n-2`, and this is printed: "? 1 ((n-2) * n)"**

In this output state, the value of `v` has been updated to the returned value of `func_2()`, while the values of `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The print statement remains the same.
