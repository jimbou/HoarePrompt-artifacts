Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is equal to n, i is 0, cnt is equal to n - 1, l is equal to func_2() + 2, and this is printed: "? 1 0"**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is still equal to `n`. The value of `i` remains 0. The value of `cnt` is decremented by 1, making it equal to `n - 1`. The value of `l` is updated to be equal to `func_2() + 2`, where `func_2()` is a function that returns a value. The printed output remains the same, "? 1 0".
