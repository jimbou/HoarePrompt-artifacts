Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is equal to `n`, `i` is 0, `cnt` is equal to 0, `l` is equal to `func_2() + 1`, `l` must be less than or equal to `n`, this is printed: "? 1 0", this is printed: "? l 0", this is printed: "? l 0", ... (n times), the current value of `cnt` is 0, the current value of `l` is `n + 1`, this is printed: "! 0", and `func_2()` has been returned.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `cnt`, and `l` remain the same as before. The function `func_2()` has been executed and its return value has been assigned to `l`. The same print statements are still printed, and the current values of `cnt` and `l` are still 0 and `n + 1`, respectively. Additionally, the function `func_2()` has been returned, indicating that its execution has completed.
