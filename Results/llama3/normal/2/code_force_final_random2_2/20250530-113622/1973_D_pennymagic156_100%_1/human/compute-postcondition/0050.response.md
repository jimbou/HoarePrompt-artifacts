To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop statement: `while cnt and l < n + 1:`. This loop will continue as long as `cnt` is truthy (in Python, non-zero values are considered true) and `l` is less than `n + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- `k` is equal to `n`.
- `i` is 1.
- `cnt` is equal to `k` which is equal to `n`.
- `l` is equal to 1.

We need to adjust the states so that the loop can certainly execute one more time. The variables in the loop head are `cnt` and `l`, and `n` indirectly affects the condition through `l < n + 1`.

1. For `cnt` to be truthy, it must be greater than 0. Since `cnt` is equal to `k` which is equal to `n`, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `cnt` is already in a state to allow the loop to execute again. No adjustment is needed here.

2. For `l < n + 1` to be true, given that `l` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, which it is. However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that after the next iteration, `l` will still be less than `n + 1`. Since `l` starts at 1 and increments (assuming from the context of the loop and the print statement), after the next iteration, `l` will be 2. Therefore, `n` must be at least 1 to satisfy `l < n + 1` after the next iteration. Given that `n` is already a positive integer greater than 0, no specific adjustment is needed for `n` to ensure the loop can execute again based on the `l < n + 1` condition.

However, considering the indirect relationship and to ensure clarity, we acknowledge that `n` being greater than 0 is sufficient for the condition involving `l` to hold true for the next iteration, given `l`'s initial state and assuming it increments.

Therefore, the state that ensures the loop can execute one more time, focusing only on the variables directly involved in the loop condition (`cnt`, `l`, and indirectly `n`), is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is equal to `n`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is equal to `k` which is equal to `n`, `l` is equal to 1**

This state ensures that both conditions (`cnt` being truthy and `l < n + 1`) are met for the loop to execute again, based on the given information and the structure of the loop.
