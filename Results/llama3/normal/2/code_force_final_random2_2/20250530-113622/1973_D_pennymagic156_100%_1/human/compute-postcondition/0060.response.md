To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `cnt` and `l` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `cnt` is not zero and `l` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` is `k` and `k` must be greater than 0, and `l` is 1. Since `cnt` is `k` and `k` must be greater than 0, `cnt` is not zero. However, `l` is 1, which is less than `n + 1` only if `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 0.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`cnt` is `k` and `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, and this is printed: "? 1 2 * v"**
