Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is equal to n, i is equal to 0, and this is printed: "? 1 (0 * n)". If the returned value of func_2() is equal to n, then v is equal to 1. Otherwise, v is equal to the returned value of func_2().**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `n` remains a positive integer, `k` is equal to `n`, and `i` is equal to 0. The loop will have printed a series of strings in the format "? 1 (i * n)" for each iteration, with `i` decreasing from `n` to 0. If the return value of `func_2()` is equal to `n` at any point, then `v` will be set to the current value of `i` (which will be 1 in the last iteration). Otherwise, `v` will be set to the return value of `func_2()`.
