Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is equal to n, i is 0, cnt is equal to 0, l is equal to func_2() + 1 and l must be less than or equal to n, and this is printed: "? 1 0", and this is printed: "? l 0", and this is printed: "? l 0", ... (n times)**.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has executed n times, and the value of `cnt` has reached 0, causing the loop to terminate. The value of `l` is still equal to `func_2() + 1` and is less than or equal to `n`. The loop has printed `n` lines, each in the format "? l 0", where `l` is the current value of `l` in each iteration.
