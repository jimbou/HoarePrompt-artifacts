Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` using `func_2()`, which reads an integer from standard input.

2. For each test case, the program reads two integers `n` and `k` using `func_3()`, which accepts a string of space-separated integers as input and returns a map object containing a sequence of integers.

3. The program then initializes a variable `v` to 1 and iterates from `n` to 1. In each iteration, it prints a query in the format "? 1 {i * n}" and reads the response using `func_2()`. If the response is `n`, it sets `v` to `i` and breaks the loop.

4. After the loop, the program iterates from 1 to `n // k + 1` and for each iteration, it prints a series of queries in the format "? {l} {i * v}" and reads the responses using `func_2()`. It keeps track of the count `cnt` and the left boundary `l`. If `cnt` becomes 0 and `l` becomes `n + 1`, it prints a query in the format "! {i * v}" and reads the response using `func_2()`.

5. If the program doesn't find a valid solution, it prints "! -1" and reads the response using `func_2()`.

The program's behavior is consistent with the problem description, and it correctly implements the required logic to find the largest value `m` such that there exists a sequence `c_1, ..., c_{k-1}` satisfying the given conditions. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
