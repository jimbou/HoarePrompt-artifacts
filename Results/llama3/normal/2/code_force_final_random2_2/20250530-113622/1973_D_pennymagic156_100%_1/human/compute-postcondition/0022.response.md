Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is equal to `n`, `i` is 0, `cnt` is equal to `n`, `l` is 1, and this is printed: "? 1 (0 * n)". If the returned value of func_2() is equal to n, then v is equal to 1. Otherwise, v is equal to the returned value of func_2().**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, and the printed message remain unchanged. The variable `cnt` is now equal to `n`, and the variable `l` is set to 1. The condition for `v` still depends on the returned value of `func_2()`.
