To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and `k`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute if `n // k + 1` is greater than `i`.
2. Since `i` is initially 0, we need to adjust `n` and `k` to ensure that `n // k + 1` is at least 1.
3. To guarantee that `n // k + 1` is at least 1, we need `n` to be greater than or equal to `k`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is equal to `n`, `i` is 0, and this is printed: "? 1 (0 * n)". If the returned value of func_2() is equal to n, then v is equal to 1. Otherwise, v is equal to the returned value of func_2().**
