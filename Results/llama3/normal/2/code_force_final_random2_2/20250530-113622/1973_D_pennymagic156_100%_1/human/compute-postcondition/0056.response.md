Output State: **`cnt` is `k`, `l` is 1, `i` is 2, `n // k + 1` is greater than 2**.

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been updated to `k`, and the value of `l` has been updated to 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. The condition `n // k + 1` is greater than 2 is still valid, as the code does not affect this condition.
