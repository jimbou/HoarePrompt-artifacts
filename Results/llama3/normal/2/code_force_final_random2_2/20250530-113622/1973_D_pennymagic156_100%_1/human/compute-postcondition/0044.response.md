To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head: `cnt and l < n + 1`.

Given the initial states:

- `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`
- `k` is equal to `n`
- `i` is 1
- `cnt` is equal to `k` which is equal to `n`
- `l` is equal to 1

And the printed statements do not affect the loop's execution directly, so we focus on the variables in the loop condition: `cnt` and `l`.

1. **For `cnt`:** Since `cnt` is equal to `k` and `k` is equal to `n`, and given that `n` is a positive integer, `cnt` is already ensured to be positive. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `cnt`.

2. **For `l`:** The condition requires `l` to be less than `n + 1`. Given that `l` is equal to 1 and `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k` (and thus greater than or equal to 1 since `k` equals `n`), `l` is already less than `n + 1`. However, to ensure this condition holds true for the loop to execute at least once, we need to confirm that `n` is indeed greater than 1, because if `n` were exactly 1, `l` would not be less than `n + 1` (since `l` is 1 and `n + 1` would be 2, making the condition true but we need to ensure it's true for the loop to execute). But since `n` is already stated to be greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` equals `n`, the condition is inherently satisfied without needing an explicit adjustment to `n` or `l` based on the given information. However, to strictly adhere to the task's requirement for clarity, we acknowledge that `n` being greater than or equal to `k` inherently means `n` can be 1 or more, and since `l` is 1, the condition `l < n + 1` is satisfied without needing a specific adjustment to `l` or `n` beyond their current definitions.

Therefore, given the conditions and the initial states, no additional adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time beyond what is already provided.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is equal to `n`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is equal to `k` which is equal to `n`, `l` is equal to 1**
