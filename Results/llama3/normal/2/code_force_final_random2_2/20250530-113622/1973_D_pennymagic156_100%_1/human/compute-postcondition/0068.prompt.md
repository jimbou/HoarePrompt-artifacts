Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, k is equal to n, i is equal to 0, and this is printed: "? 1 (0 * n)". If the returned value of func_2() is equal to n, then v is equal to 1. Otherwise, v is equal to the returned value of func_2().
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n // k + 1):
    cnt, l = k, 1
    while cnt and l < n + 1:
        print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
        l = func_2() + 1
        cnt -= 1
    if cnt == 0 and l == n + 1:
        print(f'! {i * v}', flush=True)
        func_2()
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is equal to n, i is 0, cnt is not equal to 0 or l is not equal to n + 1, l is equal to func_2() + 1 and l must be less than or equal to n, and this is printed: "? 1 0", and this is printed: "? l 0", and this is printed: "? l 0", ... (n times)

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: cnt is equal to 0, l is equal to n + 1, and this is printed: "? `l` `i * v`" where `l` is equal to `n + 1` and `i` is equal to 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: cnt is 0, l is n + 1, i is 2, n // k + 1 is greater than 2, and the strings "? 1 2 * v", "? 1 4 * v", "? 2 2 * v", ..., "? n 2 * v" are printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
