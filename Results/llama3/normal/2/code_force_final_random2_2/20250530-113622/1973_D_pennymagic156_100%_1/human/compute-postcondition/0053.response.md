Output State: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is equal to `n`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is equal to 0, `l` is equal to `n` + 1, and this is printed: "? `l` `i` * `v`" (`n` times).

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variable `cnt` has been decremented to 0, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations. The variable `l` has been incremented to `n` + 1, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times. The variable `i` remains at 1, and the variable `v` is still undefined. The loop has printed the string "? `l` `i` * `v`" `n` times, where `l` takes on values from 1 to `n` + 1, and `i` remains constant at 1.
