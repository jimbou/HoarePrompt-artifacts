To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `cnt` and `l` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `cnt` is not zero and `l` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` is equal to `k` which is equal to `n`, and `l` is equal to 1.

To ensure the loop can execute again, `cnt` must be greater than 0, and `l` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `cnt` is equal to `k` which is equal to `n`, we can ensure `cnt` is greater than 0 by making `n` greater than 0. Also, since `l` is equal to 1, we can ensure `l` is less than `n + 1` by making `n` greater than 0.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is equal to `n`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is equal to `k` which is equal to `n`, `l` is equal to 1**
