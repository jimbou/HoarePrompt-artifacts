To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head according to the loop statement.

The loop statement is: `for i in range(1, n // k + 1):`

The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`, and `k`. We need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

According to the loop statement, `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2.

The loop condition is `i < n // k + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n // k + 1`. Since `i` is now 2, `n // k + 1` must be greater than 2.

The state at the end of the previous iteration is: `cnt` is 0, `l` is `n + 1`, and `i` is 1.

Adjusting the variables in the loop head, we get:

* `i` is 2
* `n // k + 1` must be greater than 2

The other variables `cnt` and `l` are not in the loop head, so their values remain the same.

State: **`cnt` is 0, `l` is `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `n // k + 1` must be greater than 2**
