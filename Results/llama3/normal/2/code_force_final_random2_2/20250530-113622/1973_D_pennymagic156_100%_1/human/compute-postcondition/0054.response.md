Output State: **cnt is equal to 0, l is equal to n + 1, and this is printed: "? `l` `i * v`" where `l` is equal to `n + 1` and `i` is equal to 1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the counter `cnt` is equal to 0, the variable `l` is equal to `n + 1`, and the last printed statement is "? `l` `i * v`" where `l` is equal to `n + 1` and `i` is equal to 1. This indicates that the loop has finished executing all its iterations, and the final values of `cnt` and `l` are as expected.
