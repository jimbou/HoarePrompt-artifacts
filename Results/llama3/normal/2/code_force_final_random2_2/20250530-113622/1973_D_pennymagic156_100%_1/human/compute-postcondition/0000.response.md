Output State: **n and k are positive integers, v is 1**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line calls the function `func_3()` and assigns its return values to `n` and `k`. Since `n` and `k` are positive integers, their values are updated to the returned values from the function. The second line assigns the value 1 to `v`. No other variables are affected.

In the final state, `n` and `k` are positive integers with their updated values from the function `func_3()`, and `v` is 1.
