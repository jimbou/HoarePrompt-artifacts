Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables involved in the print statement.

* `n` is a positive integer, but its exact value is not specified.
* `k` is also a positive integer, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.
* `v` is explicitly set to 1.
* `i` is set to `n`, which means `i` is also a positive integer.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)`

The print statement uses an f-string to format the output. The expression `i * n` will be evaluated and inserted into the string.

Since `i` is equal to `n`, the expression `i * n` is equivalent to `n * n`, which is the square of `n`.

So, the output will be a string that starts with '? 1 ' followed by the square of `n`.

Output: **? 1 [n^2] (where n is a positive integer)**
