Output State: `cnt` is 0, `l` is `n // k + 1`, `i` is 2, `n // k + 1` is greater than 2, and the strings "? 1 2 * v", "? 1 4 * v", "? 2 2 * v", ..., "? `n // k` 2 * v" are printed.

The loop will continue to execute until `cnt` is 0 or `l` is greater than or equal to `n + 1`. Since `cnt` is initially `k` and `k` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. In each iteration, `cnt` is decremented by 1 and `l` is incremented by 1. Therefore, after `k` iterations, `cnt` will be 0 and `l` will be `n // k + 1`. The loop will then terminate.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations will have `cnt` as 0, `l` as `n // k + 1`, and `i` as 2, which is the initial value of `i`. The output state will also include the strings printed in each iteration, which are "? 1 2 * v", "? 1 4 * v", "? 2 2 * v", ..., "? `n // k` 2 * v".
