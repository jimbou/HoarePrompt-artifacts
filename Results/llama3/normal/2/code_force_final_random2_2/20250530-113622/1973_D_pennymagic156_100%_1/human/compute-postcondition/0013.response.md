Postcondition: **If the return value of func_2() is equal to n, then n, k, v, and i are all equal to n. Otherwise, if v is equal to n, then v is equal to n-1, i is equal to n-1, k is equal to n, and n is a positive integer. Otherwise, no changes are made and i is equal to n-1, and this is printed: ? 1 [i * n] where i is equal to n-1 and n is a positive integer.**
