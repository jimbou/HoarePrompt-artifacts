This function takes no parameters and returns nothing. It prints a series of strings in the format "? a b" and "! c" to the console, where a, b, and c are integers. The function's purpose is to interact with an external entity (likely a game or a puzzle) by sending queries and receiving responses. The function's behavior is determined by the responses it receives from the external entity, and it may terminate early if certain conditions are met. In all cases, the function will eventually print "! -1" and terminate without providing any output or result.
