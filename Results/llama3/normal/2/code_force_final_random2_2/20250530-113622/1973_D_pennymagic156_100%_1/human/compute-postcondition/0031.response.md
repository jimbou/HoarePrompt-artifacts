To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop statement: `cnt and l < n + 1`.

1. `cnt` must be true (or non-zero, since we're dealing with integers and the context suggests a count or similar). Since `cnt` is equal to `n - 2`, for `cnt` to be true (or greater than 0), `n` must be greater than 2. However, we're given that `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, so we need to adjust this to ensure `n` is at least 3 to satisfy the condition that `cnt` is greater than 0.

2. `l < n + 1` must be true. Given that `l` is equal to `func_2() + 1`, we cannot directly adjust `l` without knowing the value of `func_2()`. However, we can infer that for the loop to execute again, `l` must be less than `n + 1`. Since we're adjusting `n` to be at least 3, we should ensure that `l` remains less than `n + 1`. Given the initial condition that `l` is equal to `func_2() + 1`, we cannot directly adjust `l` without more information, but we can state that `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

Other variables (`i`, `k`, the printed statements) are not part of the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2 (or at least 3), `k` is equal to `n`, `i` is 0, `cnt` is equal to `n - 2`, `l` is equal to `func_2() + 1` and `l` must be less than `n + 1`, and this is printed: "? 1 0", and this is printed: "? l 0"**
