Output State: **cnt is equal to 0, l is equal to n + 1, i is equal to n // k, and the strings "? 1 i * v", "? 2 i * v", ..., "? n i * v" are printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the final values of the variables are as follows:

*   `cnt` is 0, indicating that the inner while loop has finished executing.
*   `l` is `n + 1`, which means the inner while loop has reached its termination condition.
*   `i` is `n // k`, which is the final value of the loop counter after all iterations.
*   The strings "? 1 i \* v", "? 2 i \* v", ..., "? n i \* v" are printed, indicating that the loop has executed `n // k` times and printed the corresponding strings in each iteration.

Note that the state of other variables not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
