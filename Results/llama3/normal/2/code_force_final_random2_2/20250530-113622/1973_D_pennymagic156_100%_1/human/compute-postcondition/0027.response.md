To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop statement: `cnt and l < n + 1`. This means both conditions must be true for the loop to continue.

1. `cnt` must be true (non-zero), since it's a part of the `and` condition.
2. `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`.
- `k` is equal to `n`.
- `i` is 0.
- `cnt` is equal to `n - 1`.
- `l` is equal to `func_2() + 2`.
- Printed: "? 1 0"

To adjust the state so that the loop can execute one more time, we focus on the variables in the loop head: `cnt` and `l`.

- For `cnt` to be true (non-zero), given that `cnt` is equal to `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1. This is because if `n` were 1, `cnt` would be 0, and the loop would not execute again.
- For `l` to be less than `n + 1`, considering `l` is equal to `func_2() + 2`, we need to ensure that `func_2() + 2` is less than `n + 1`. This implies that `func_2()` should be less than `n - 1` for the loop to execute again.

However, since we cannot directly modify the output of `func_2()` or make assumptions about its behavior, we focus on the conditions that can be directly influenced by the given state. Thus, we ensure that `n` is greater than 1 to satisfy the condition for `cnt`, and we acknowledge that `l` must be less than `n + 1` without specifying `func_2()`'s behavior.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is equal to `n`, `i` is 0, `cnt` is equal to `n - 1`, `l` is less than `n + 1`, and this is printed: "? 1 0"**
