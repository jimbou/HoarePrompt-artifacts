Based on the initial state, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `l` is equal to 1
* `i` is equal to 1
* `v` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value. However, since `i` is multiplied by `v`, we can describe the output in terms of `v`.

The print statement will output a string in the format `? 1 <result of i * v>`, where `<result of i * v>` is the product of `i` (which is 1) and `v` (whose value is unknown).

Output: **? 1 (1 * v) (where v is the value of v)**
