The code assigns the value of `ma` to be `int(num2 / 2) - 1`. Since `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000 and is even, `num2 / 2` will be an integer. Therefore, `ma` will be an integer less than or equal to 4999.

Output State: **`num` is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, `i` is 0, `num2` is an integer less or equal than 10000 and is even, `op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `case` is a string, `ma` is an integer less than or equal to 4999, stdin is empty**
