You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (n) and then a list of n integers. The integer is a positive integer and less or equal than 10^5. The integers in the list are positive integers and less or equal than 10^9.
    num = int(input())
    for i in range(0, num):
        num2 = int(input())
        
        case = input()
        
        op = 0
        
        if num2 > 10000:
            print(1)
            print(16668)
            break
        else:
            a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
            b = sorted(a)
            if num2 % 2 == 0:
                ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
            else:
                ma = int(num2 / 2)
            median = b[ma]
            new_median = median
            while new_median <= median:
                b[ma] += 1
                op += 1
                b = sorted(b)
                new_median = b[ma]
            print(op)
        
    #State: num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is equal to num, num2 is an integer, case is a string, stdin is empty. If num2 > 10000, the number 1 is being printed, the number 16668 is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, op is the number of times the loop executes, a is a list of digits extracted from case, b is a sorted list of digits extracted from case with the digit at index ma incremented by the number of times the loop executes, ma is either int(num2 / 2) - 1 or the integer part of num2 divided by 2, median is the digit at index ma in b before increment, new_median is the digit at index ma in b after increment and sorting, and the number of times the loop executes which is [op] is being printed.

```

Return Postconditions: num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is equal to num, num2 is an integer, case is a string, stdin is empty. If num2 > 10000, the number 1 is being printed, the number 16668 is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, op is the number of times the loop executes, a is a list of digits extracted from case, b is a sorted list of digits extracted from case with the digit at index ma incremented by the number of times the loop executes, ma is either int(num2 / 2) - 1 or the integer part of num2 divided by 2, median is the digit at index ma in b before increment, new_median is the digit at index ma in b after increment and sorting, and the number of times the loop executes which is [op] is being printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
