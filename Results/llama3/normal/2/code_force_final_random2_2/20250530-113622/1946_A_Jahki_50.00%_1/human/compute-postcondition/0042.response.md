Output State: **num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is 1, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 2, a is a list of integers that are digits in the string case, b is a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string case, new_median is the (ma+1)th smallest digit in the string case, median is greater than or equal to new_median, and the value at index ma in list b is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `op` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The list `b` is sorted, and the value at index `ma` in list `b` is incremented by 1. The value of `new_median` is updated to be the (ma+1)th smallest digit in the string case, which is the value at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
