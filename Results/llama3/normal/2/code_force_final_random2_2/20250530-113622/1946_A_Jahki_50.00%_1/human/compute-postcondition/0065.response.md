The only variable in the loop head is new_median and median, so we can only adjust those two.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables new_median and median.  If new_median is less than or equal to median, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, new_median is less than or equal to median + 1, So for the loop to be executed one more time new_median must be less than or equal to median.
State: **num is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^5, i is 2, num2 is an integer, case is a string, stdin is empty, op is 2, a is a list of digits extracted from case, b is a sorted list of digits extracted from case with the digit at index ma incremented by 1, ma is either int(num2 / 2) - 1 or the integer part of num2 divided by 2, median is the digit at index ma in b before increment, new_median is less than or equal to median**
