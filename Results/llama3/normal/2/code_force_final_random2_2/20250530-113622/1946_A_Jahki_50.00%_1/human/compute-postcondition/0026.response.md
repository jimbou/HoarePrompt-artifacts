Postcondition: ***num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is 0, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 0, stdin is empty. If num2 is greater than 10000, the number 1 is printed, the number 16668 is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If num2 is less or equal than 10000, a list of integers a is created, a sorted list of integers b is created, median is an integer, new_median is an integer greater than median, ma is an integer less than or equal to 5000 and ma must correspond to a value in b that is greater than the value at the current index ma, and the value of op which is an integer greater than or equal to 0 is being printed.***
