Output State: **num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is 0, num2 is an integer less or equal than 10000, op is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, case is a string, median is an integer, new_median is an integer greater than median, ma is an integer less than or equal to 5000 and ma must correspond to a value in b that is greater than the value at the current index ma.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is:

The loop will continue to execute until `new_median` is greater than `median`. After the loop finishes, `op` will be an integer greater than or equal to 0, indicating the number of times the loop executed. The list `b` will be sorted, and `ma` will correspond to a value in `b` that is greater than the value at the current index `ma`. The other variables, `num`, `i`, `num2`, `a`, `case`, and `median`, will remain unchanged.
