Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the median of the input array and then increments the median until it exceeds the original median. The number of operations required to do this is then printed.

The program handles both even and odd length arrays correctly, and it also handles the case where the input array has more than 10,000 elements.

The use of the `sorted` function to sort the array is efficient, and the use of a while loop to increment the median until it exceeds the original median is also efficient.

The program also correctly handles the case where the input array has duplicate elements, and it correctly calculates the number of operations required to increment the median in this case.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient.

Correctness: **True**
