The variables in the loop head are new_median and median, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables new_median and median. If new_median is less than or equal to median, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, new_median is b[ma] and median is an integer. For the loop to execute one more time, new_median must be less than or equal to median. Since new_median is b[ma], we need to adjust b[ma] to be less than or equal to median. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is 0, num2 is an integer less or equal than 10000, op is 1, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers with b[ma] incremented by 1 and b[ma] must be less than or equal to median, case is a string, median is an integer, new_median is b[ma], ma is an integer less than or equal to 5000 and ma must correspond to a value in b that is less than or equal to the value at the current index ma**
