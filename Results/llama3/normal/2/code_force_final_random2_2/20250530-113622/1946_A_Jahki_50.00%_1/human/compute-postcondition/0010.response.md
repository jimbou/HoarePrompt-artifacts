Output State: **num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is 0, num2 is an integer less or equal than 10000, op is 0, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, case is a string, stdin is empty**

In this final state, the values of `num`, `i`, `num2`, and `op` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The variable `a` is assigned a list of integers that are extracted from the string `case` by splitting it into substrings and converting the numeric substrings to integers. The variable `b` is assigned a sorted version of the list `a`. The string `case` remains unchanged, and the stdin remains empty as it was initially.
