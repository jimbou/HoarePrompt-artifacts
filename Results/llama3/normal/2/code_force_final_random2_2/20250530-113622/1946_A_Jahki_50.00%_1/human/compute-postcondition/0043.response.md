To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `new_median` and `median`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`. At the end of the last iteration, `new_median` is the (ma+1)th smallest digit in the string `case`, and `median` is greater than or equal to `new_median`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `median` to be greater than `new_median`. This is because if `median` is equal to `new_median`, the loop condition will not be satisfied, and the loop will not execute again.

No other states need to be adjusted, as the loop condition only depends on `new_median` and `median`.

State: **num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is 1, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 2, a is a list of integers that are digits in the string case, b is a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string case, new_median is the (ma+1)th smallest digit in the string case, and median is greater than new_median**
