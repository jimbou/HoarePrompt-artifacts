Output State: **num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is 2, num2 is an integer, case is a string, stdin is empty, op is 0**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to num2. Since stdin is empty, this line does not affect the state of stdin. The second line assigns the string value of the input to case. Again, since stdin is empty, this line does not affect the state of stdin. The third line initializes op to 0.

The initial state of num, i, and stdin remains unchanged as none of these variables are modified by the code. The value of num2 is updated to the integer value of the input, and the value of case is updated to the string value of the input. The value of op is initialized to 0.

Note that the conditions and variables mentioned in the precondition that are not affected by the code (num, i, stdin) are included in the output state, and the values of num2, case, and op are updated according to the code.
