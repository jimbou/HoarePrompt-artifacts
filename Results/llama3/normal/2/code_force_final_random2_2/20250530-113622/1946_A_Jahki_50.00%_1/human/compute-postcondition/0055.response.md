Output State: **`num` is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, `i` is 2, `num2` is an integer, `case` is a string, `op` is 0, the number 1 is being printed, and the number 16668 is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of `num`, `i`, `num2`, `case`, and `op` remain unchanged, and the numbers 1 and 16668 are still being printed.
