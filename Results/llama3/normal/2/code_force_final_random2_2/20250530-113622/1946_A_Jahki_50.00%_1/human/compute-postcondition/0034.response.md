Output State: **num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is 1, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 0, a is a list of integers that are digits in the string case, b is a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string case.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line creates a list `a` containing integers that are digits in the string `case`. The `split()` function splits the string into a list of substrings separated by spaces, and the `isdigit()` function checks if each substring is a digit. The `int(i)` function converts each digit substring to an integer. The second line sorts the list `a` in ascending order and assigns it to `b`. The `sorted()` function returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence. 

The initial state of the variables `num`, `i`, `num2`, `case`, and `op` remains unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet. The variable `a` is created and assigned a list of integers that are digits in the string `case`. The variable `b` is created and assigned a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string `case`.
