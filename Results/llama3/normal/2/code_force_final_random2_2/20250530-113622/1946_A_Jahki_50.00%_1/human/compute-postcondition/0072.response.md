Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer (n) and a list of n positive integers. For each test case, it calculates the number of operations required to increment the median of the list until it exceeds the original median. If the list size (n) is greater than 10,000, it prints 1 and 16,668 and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it prints the number of operations required to increment the median. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point the standard input is empty.**
