#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (n) and then a list of n integers. The integer is a positive integer and less or equal than 10^5. The integers in the list are positive integers and less or equal than 10^9.
    num = int(input())
    for i in range(0, num):
        num2 = int(input())
        
        case = input()
        
        op = 0
        
        if num2 > 10000:
            print(1)
            print(16668)
            break
        else:
            a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
            b = sorted(a)
            if num2 % 2 == 0:
                ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
            else:
                ma = int(num2 / 2)
            median = b[ma]
            new_median = median
            while new_median <= median:
                b[ma] += 1
                op += 1
                b = sorted(b)
                new_median = b[ma]
            print(op)
        
    #State: num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is equal to num, num2 is an integer, case is a string, stdin is empty. If num2 > 10000, the number 1 is being printed, the number 16668 is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, op is the number of times the loop executes, a is a list of digits extracted from case, b is a sorted list of digits extracted from case with the digit at index ma incremented by the number of times the loop executes, ma is either int(num2 / 2) - 1 or the integer part of num2 divided by 2, median is the digit at index ma in b before increment, new_median is the digit at index ma in b after increment and sorting, and the number of times the loop executes which is [op] is being printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer (n) and a list of n positive integers. For each test case, it calculates the number of operations required to increment the median of the list until it exceeds the original median. If the list size (n) is greater than 10,000, it prints 1 and 16,668 and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it prints the number of operations required to increment the median. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point the standard input is empty.
