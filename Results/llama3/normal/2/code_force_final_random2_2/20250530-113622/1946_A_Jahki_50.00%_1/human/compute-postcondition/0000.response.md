Output State: **`num` is a positive integer and less or equal than 10^5, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains one input: a list of `num` integers. The integers in the list are positive integers and less or equal than 10^9.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been assigned the first input from the stdin, which is a positive integer and less or equal than 10^5. The stdin now contains one less input, which is a list of `num` integers. The integers in the list are still positive integers and less or equal than 10^9.
