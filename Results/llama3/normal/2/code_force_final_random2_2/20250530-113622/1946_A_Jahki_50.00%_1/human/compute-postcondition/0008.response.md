Output State: **`num` is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, `i` is 0, `num2` is an integer greater than 10000, `case` is a string, `op` is 0, stdin is empty, the number 1 is being printed, the number 16668 is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values, as the `break` statement does not affect any variable values. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement we were directly inside. The numbers 1 and 16668 are still being printed, and the stdin remains empty.
