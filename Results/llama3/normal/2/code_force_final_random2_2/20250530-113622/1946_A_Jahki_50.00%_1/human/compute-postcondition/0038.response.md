Output State: **num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is 1, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 0, a is a list of integers that are digits in the string case, b is a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string case, median is an integer, new_median is an integer. If num2 is even, ma is int(num2 / 2) - 1. If num2 is odd, ma is the integer division of num2 by 2.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `b[ma]` to `median` and then assigns the value of `median` to `new_median`. The value of `ma` depends on whether `num2` is even or odd. If `num2` is even, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1`, and if `num2` is odd, `ma` is the integer division of `num2` by 2. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The variables `num`, `i`, `num2`, `case`, and `op` also remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
