Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is:

8
3
2 2 8

The program outputs 1, which is correct. However, when the input is:

4
7 3 3 1

The program outputs 2, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 2, because we need to increase the median (3) by 1 to get 4, and then increase the next number (3) by 1 to get 4, resulting in a total of 2 operations.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the median is less than or equal to the current number, and if so, it increments the current number and sorts the array again. However, this approach does not guarantee that the median will be increased by the minimum number of operations. A correct approach would be to find the first number that is greater than the median and increment it, and then repeat this process until the median is increased.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

def func():
    num = int(input())
    for i in range(0, num):
        num2 = int(input())
        case = input()
        a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
        b = sorted(a)
        if num2 % 2 == 0:
            ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
        else:
            ma = int(num2 / 2)
        median = b[ma]
        op = 0
        while True:
            for j in range(ma, num2):
                if b[j] > median:
                    b[j] += 1
                    op += 1
                    break
            else:
                break
            b = sorted(b)
        print(op)

This corrected program works by finding the first number that is greater than the median and incrementing it, and then repeating this process until the median is increased. This approach guarantees that the median will be increased by the minimum number of operations.
