According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `new_median` and `median`. If `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `new_median` is the (ma+1)th smallest digit in the string case, and `median` is not specified. To ensure the loop can execute again, `median` must be greater than or equal to `new_median`. Since `new_median` is the (ma+1)th smallest digit, `median` must be at least the (ma+1)th smallest digit or greater.

State: **`num` is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, `i` is 1, `num2` is an integer, `case` is a string, `op` is 1, `a` is a list of integers that are digits in the string case, `b` is a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string case, `new_median` is the (ma+1)th smallest digit in the string case, `median` is greater than or equal to `new_median**
