Postcondition: ***num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is 2, num2 is an integer, case is a string, stdin is empty. If num2 > 10000, the number 1 is being printed, and the number 16668 is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, op is the number of times the loop executes, a is a list of digits extracted from case, b is a sorted list of digits extracted from case with the digit at index ma incremented by the number of times the loop executes, ma is either int(num2 / 2) - 1 or the integer part of num2 divided by 2, median is the digit at index ma in b before increment, new_median is the digit at index ma in b after increment and sorting, and the number of times the loop executes which is [op] is being printed.***
