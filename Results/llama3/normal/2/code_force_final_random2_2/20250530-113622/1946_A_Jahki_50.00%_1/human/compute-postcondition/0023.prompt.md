Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is 0, num2 is an integer less or equal than 10000, op is 0, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, case is a string, median is an integer, new_median is an integer, ma is an integer less than or equal to 5000. If num2 is even, then ma is an integer less than or equal to 4999. If num2 is odd, then ma is an integer less than or equal to 5000. median and new_median are equal to the value of b at index ma.
Code of the loop:
while new_median <= median:
    b[ma] += 1
    op += 1
    b = sorted(b)
    new_median = b[ma]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is 0, num2 is an integer less or equal than 10000, op is 1, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers with b[ma] incremented by 1, case is a string, median is an integer, new_median is b[ma], ma is an integer less than or equal to 5000 and ma must correspond to a value in b that is less than or equal to the value at the current index ma.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is 0, num2 is an integer less or equal than 10000, op is 2, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers with b[ma] incremented by 2 and b[ma] must be less than or equal to median, case is a string, median is an integer, new_median is b[ma], ma is an integer less than or equal to 5000 and ma must correspond to a value in b that is less than or equal to the value at the current index ma
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is 0, num2 is an integer less or equal than 10000, op is 3, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, case is a string, median is an integer, new_median is b[ma], ma is an integer less than or equal to 5000 and ma must correspond to a value in b that is less than or equal to the value at the current index ma


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
