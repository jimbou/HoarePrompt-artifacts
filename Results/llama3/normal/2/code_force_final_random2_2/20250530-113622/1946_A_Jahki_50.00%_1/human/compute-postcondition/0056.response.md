The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line creates a list `a` containing the digits extracted from the string `case`, and the second line sorts the list `a` in ascending order and assigns it to `b`. 

Since `num` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^5, `i` is 2, `num2` is an integer, `case` is a string, `stdin` is empty, and `op` is 0, these variables remain unchanged after the execution of the code snippet.

The final state includes the original values of `num`, `i`, `num2`, `stdin`, and `op`, as well as the new values of `a` and `b`. 

Output State: **num is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^5, i is 2, num2 is an integer, case is a string, stdin is empty, op is 0, a is a list of digits extracted from case, b is a sorted list of digits extracted from case.**
