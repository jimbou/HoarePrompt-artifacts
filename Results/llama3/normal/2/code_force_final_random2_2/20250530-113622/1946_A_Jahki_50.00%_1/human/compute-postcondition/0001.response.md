The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and num, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. If num is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, num is a positive integer and less or equal than 10^5 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `num` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`num` is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, `i` is 0**
