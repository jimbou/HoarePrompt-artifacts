Postcondition: ***num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is 1, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 0, a is a list of integers that are digits in the string case, b is a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string case. If num2 is even, ma is int(num2 / 2) - 1. If num2 is odd, ma is the integer division of num2 by 2.***
