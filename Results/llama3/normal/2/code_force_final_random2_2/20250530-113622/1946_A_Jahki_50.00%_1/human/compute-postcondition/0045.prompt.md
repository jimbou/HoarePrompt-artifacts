Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is 1, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 0, a is a list of integers that are digits in the string case, b is a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string case, median is an integer, new_median is an integer. If num2 is even, ma is int(num2 / 2) - 1. If num2 is odd, ma is the integer division of num2 by 2.
Code of the loop:
while new_median <= median:
    b[ma] += 1
    op += 1
    b = sorted(b)
    new_median = b[ma]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is 1, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 1, a is a list of integers that are digits in the string case, b is a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string case, new_median is the (ma+1)th smallest digit in the string case
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is 1, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 2, a is a list of integers that are digits in the string case, b is a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string case, new_median is the (ma+1)th smallest digit in the string case, median is greater than or equal to new_median, and the value at index ma in list b is incremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is 1, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 3, a is a list of integers that are digits in the string case, b is a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string case, new_median is the (ma+1)th smallest digit in the string case, and median is greater than the previous new_median


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
