Output State: **num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is 0, num2 is an integer less or equal than 10000, op is 1, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers with b[ma] incremented by 1, case is a string, median is an integer, new_median is b[ma], ma is an integer less than or equal to 5000 and ma must correspond to a value in b that is less than or equal to the value at the current index ma.**

In this final state, the value of `op` has been incremented by 1, and the list `b` has been sorted after incrementing the value at index `ma` by 1. The value of `new_median` has been updated to the new value at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
