Output State: **num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is 1, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 0, stdin is empty.**

The code snippet does not modify the values of `num`, `i`, or `op`. The first line assigns an integer value from stdin to `num2`, but since stdin is empty, this line does not affect the state of `num2`. The second line assigns a string value from stdin to `case`, but again, since stdin is empty, this line does not affect the state of `case`. The third line assigns 0 to `op`, but since `op` is already 0, this line does not change its value. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
