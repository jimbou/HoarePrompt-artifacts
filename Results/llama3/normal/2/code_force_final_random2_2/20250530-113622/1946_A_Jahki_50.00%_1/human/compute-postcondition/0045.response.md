Output State: **num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is 1, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is the number of times the loop executes, a is a list of integers that are digits in the string case, b is a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string case, new_median is the (ma+1)th smallest digit in the string case, and median is less than new_median.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the number of operations (op) is equal to the number of times the loop executes, and the median is less than the new median. The other variables remain unchanged.
