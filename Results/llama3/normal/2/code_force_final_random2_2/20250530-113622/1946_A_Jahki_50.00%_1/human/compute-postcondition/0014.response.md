Output State: **`num` is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, `i` is 0, `num2` is an integer less or equal than 10000 and not divisible by 2, `op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `case` is a string, `ma` is an integer less or equal than 5000, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `ma` has been calculated as the integer division of `num2` by 2. Since `num2` is an integer less or equal than 10000 and not divisible by 2, the value of `ma` will be an integer less or equal than 5000. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
