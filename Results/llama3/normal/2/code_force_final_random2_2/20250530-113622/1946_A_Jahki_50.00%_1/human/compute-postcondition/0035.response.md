The code `ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1` assigns the value of `int(num2 / 2) - 1` to `ma`. Since `num2` is an integer, `num2 / 2` will be a float, and `int(num2 / 2)` will truncate this float to an integer. Then, subtracting 1 from this integer gives the final value of `ma`.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`num` is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, `i` is 1, `num2` is an integer, `case` is a string, `op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers that are digits in the string `case`, `b` is a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string `case`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1`.**
