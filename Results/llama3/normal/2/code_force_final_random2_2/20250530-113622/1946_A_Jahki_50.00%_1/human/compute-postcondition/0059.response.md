Postcondition: ***num is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^5, i is 2, num2 is an integer, case is a string, stdin is empty, op is 0, a is a list of digits extracted from case, b is a sorted list of digits extracted from case. If num2 is even, ma is equal to int(num2 / 2) - 1. If num2 is odd, ma is equal to the integer part of num2 divided by 2.***
