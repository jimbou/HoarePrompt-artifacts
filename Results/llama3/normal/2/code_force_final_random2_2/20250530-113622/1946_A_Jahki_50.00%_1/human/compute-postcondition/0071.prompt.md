Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num` is a positive integer and less or equal than 10^5, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains one input: a list of `num` integers. The integers in the list are positive integers and less or equal than 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    op = 0
    if num2 > 10000:
        print(1)
        print(16668)
        break
    else:
        a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
        b = sorted(a)
        if num2 % 2 == 0:
            ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
        else:
            ma = int(num2 / 2)
        median = b[ma]
        new_median = median
        while new_median <= median:
            b[ma] += 1
            op += 1
            b = sorted(b)
            new_median = b[ma]
        print(op)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is 0, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 0, stdin is empty. If num2 is greater than 10000, the number 1 is printed, the number 16668 is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If num2 is less or equal than 10000, a list of integers a is created, a sorted list of integers b is created, median is an integer, new_median is an integer greater than median, ma is an integer less than or equal to 5000 and ma must correspond to a value in b that is greater than the value at the current index ma, and the value of op which is an integer greater than or equal to 0 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is 1, num2 is an integer, case is a string, stdin is empty. If num2 > 10000, the number 1 is being printed, the number 16668 is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, op is the number of times the loop executes, a is a list of integers that are digits in the string case, b is a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string case, new_median is the (ma+1)th smallest digit in the string case, and median is less than new_median, and the number of times the loop executes which is op is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is 2, num2 is an integer, case is a string, stdin is empty. If num2 > 10000, the number 1 is being printed, and the number 16668 is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, op is the number of times the loop executes, a is a list of digits extracted from case, b is a sorted list of digits extracted from case with the digit at index ma incremented by the number of times the loop executes, ma is either int(num2 / 2) - 1 or the integer part of num2 divided by 2, median is the digit at index ma in b before increment, new_median is the digit at index ma in b after increment and sorting, and the number of times the loop executes which is [op] is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
