The code `ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1` assigns a new value to the variable `ma`. The value of `ma` is calculated by dividing `num2` by 2, converting the result to an integer using `int()`, and then subtracting 1.

Since `num2` is an integer, the division `num2 / 2` will result in a floating-point number. The `int()` function will truncate this number to an integer, effectively rounding down to the nearest whole number. Then, subtracting 1 from this result gives the final value of `ma`.

The other variables in the initial state are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`num` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^5, `i` is 2, `num2` is an integer, `case` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `op` is 0, `a` is a list of digits extracted from `case`, `b` is a sorted list of digits extracted from `case`, and `ma` is equal to `int(num2 / 2) - 1`.**
