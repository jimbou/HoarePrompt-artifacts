The code snippet assigns the value of `b[ma]` to `median` and then assigns the value of `median` to `new_median`. Since `ma` is either `int(num2 / 2) - 1` or the integer part of `num2` divided by 2, depending on whether `num2` is even or odd, `median` and `new_median` will be assigned the value of the digit at the index `ma` in the sorted list `b`.

Output State: **num is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^5, i is 2, num2 is an integer, case is a string, stdin is empty, op is 0, a is a list of digits extracted from case, b is a sorted list of digits extracted from case, ma is either int(num2 / 2) - 1 or the integer part of num2 divided by 2, median is the digit at index ma in b, new_median is the digit at index ma in b.**
