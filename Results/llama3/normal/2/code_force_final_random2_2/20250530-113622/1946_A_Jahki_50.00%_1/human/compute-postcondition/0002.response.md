Output State: **num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is 0, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 0, stdin is empty**

The code snippet consists of four lines. The first line assigns an integer value from the input to `num2`. The second line assigns a string value from the input to `case`. The third line initializes `op` to 0. 

After executing the entire code block, `num` remains unchanged as it is not modified by any line in the code. `i` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by any line in the code. `num2` is assigned an integer value from the input. `case` is assigned a string value from the input. `op` is initialized to 0. Stdin is empty after the execution of the code as two inputs are consumed.
