To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `new_median <= median`. This means we can only adjust the states of `new_median` and `median` since they are the variables in the loop head.

Given the initial state:
- `num` is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5
- `i` is 1
- `num2` is an integer
- `case` is a string
- `op` is 0
- `a` is a list of integers that are digits in the string `case`
- `b` is a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string `case`
- `median` is an integer
- `new_median` is an integer

And the condition for `ma` based on `num2` being even or odd, which does not directly affect the loop condition but is part of the overall state.

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `new_median <= median` must be true. Therefore, we need to ensure that `new_median` is indeed less than or equal to `median`. Given that `new_median` and `median` are integers, and without specific values for them, we can only state the relationship that needs to hold for the loop to execute.

State: **`num` is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, `i` is 1, `num2` is an integer, `case` is a string, `op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers that are digits in the string `case`, `b` is a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string `case`, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`**
