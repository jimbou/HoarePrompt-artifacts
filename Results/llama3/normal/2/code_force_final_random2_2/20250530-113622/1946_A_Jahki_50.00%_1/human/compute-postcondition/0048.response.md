Postcondition: ***num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is 1, num2 is an integer, case is a string, stdin is empty. If num2 > 10000, the number 1 is being printed, the number 16668 is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, op is the number of times the loop executes, a is a list of integers that are digits in the string case, b is a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string case, new_median is the (ma+1)th smallest digit in the string case, and median is less than new_median, and the number of times the loop executes which is op is being printed.***
