Output State: **num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is 1, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 0, stdin is empty, the number 1 is being printed, the number 16668 is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `num`, `i`, `num2`, `case`, and `op` remain unchanged. The stdin is still empty, and the numbers 1 and 16668 are still being printed. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
