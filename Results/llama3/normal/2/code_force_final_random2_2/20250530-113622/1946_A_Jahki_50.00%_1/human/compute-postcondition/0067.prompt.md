Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: num is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^5, i is 2, num2 is an integer, case is a string, stdin is empty, op is 0, a is a list of digits extracted from case, b is a sorted list of digits extracted from case, ma is either int(num2 / 2) - 1 or the integer part of num2 divided by 2, median is the digit at index ma in b, new_median is the digit at index ma in b.
Code of the loop:
while new_median <= median:
    b[ma] += 1
    op += 1
    b = sorted(b)
    new_median = b[ma]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: num is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^5, i is 2, num2 is an integer, case is a string, stdin is empty, op is 1, a is a list of digits extracted from case, b is a sorted list of digits extracted from case with the digit at index ma incremented by 1, ma is either int(num2 / 2) - 1 or the integer part of num2 divided by 2, median is the digit at index ma in b before increment, new_median is the digit at index ma in b after increment and sorting.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: num is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^5, i is 2, num2 is an integer, case is a string, stdin is empty, op is 2, a is a list of digits extracted from case, b is a sorted list of digits extracted from case with the digit at index ma incremented by 1, ma is either int(num2 / 2) - 1 or the integer part of num2 divided by 2, median is the digit at index ma in b before increment, new_median is the digit at index ma in b after increment and sorting and new_median is less than or equal to median + 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: num is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^5, i is 2, num2 is an integer, case is a string, stdin is empty, op is 3, a is a list of digits extracted from case, b is a sorted list of digits extracted from case with the digit at index ma incremented by 1 and then sorted, ma is either int(num2 / 2) - 1 or the integer part of num2 divided by 2, median is the digit at index ma in b before increment, new_median is the digit at index ma in b after increment and sorting.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
