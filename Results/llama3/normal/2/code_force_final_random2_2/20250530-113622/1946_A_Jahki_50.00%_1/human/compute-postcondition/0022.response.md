Output State: **num is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, i is 0, num2 is an integer less or equal than 10000, op is 3, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, case is a string, median is an integer, new_median is b[ma], ma is an integer less than or equal to 5000 and ma must correspond to a value in b that is less than or equal to the value at the current index ma**

The code modifies the values of `b`, `op`, and `new_median`. The first line increments the value of `b[ma]` by 1, which affects the sorted list `b`. The second line increments the value of `op` by 1, making it 3. The third line re-sorts the list `b` in ascending order. The fourth line updates the value of `new_median` to be the value at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
