The value of `ma` is assigned the value of `num2 / 2` converted to an integer. The value of `num2` is an integer, so the value of `ma` is the integer division of `num2` by 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`num` is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^5, `i` is 1, `num2` is an integer, `case` is a string, `op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers that are digits in the string `case`, `b` is a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string `case`, `ma` is the integer division of `num2` by 2**
