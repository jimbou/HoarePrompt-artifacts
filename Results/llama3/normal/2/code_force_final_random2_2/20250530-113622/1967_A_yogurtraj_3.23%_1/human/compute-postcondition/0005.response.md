Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a space-separated list of integers. Additionally, the product of (i+1) and the difference between the (i+1)th and ith elements of `a` is less than or equal to `k`***
