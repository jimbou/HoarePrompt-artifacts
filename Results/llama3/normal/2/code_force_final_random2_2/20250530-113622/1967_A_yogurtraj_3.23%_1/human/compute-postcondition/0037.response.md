The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not specified, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. 
State: **n is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: 2 integers and a space-separated list of integers. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then k is 0, r is the 3rd smallest integer in a plus k divided by 2, rem is the remainder of k divided by 2, and y is n - 2. Otherwise, k is decreased by a non-negative value, r is the third smallest integer in a, rem is 0, and y is 0, i is 1**
