Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is not equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the (n-1)th smallest integer in `a` plus `k` divided by `n`, `rem` is the remainder of `k` divided by `(n-1)`, `y` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: 2 integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is `n-1`.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to be the (n-1)th smallest integer in `a` plus `k` divided by `n`, instead of `(n-1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
