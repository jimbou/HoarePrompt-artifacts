Output State: **n is an integer that must be at least 3, k is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 times the difference between the third and second elements of a, r is the third element of a, rem is an integer, y is an integer, i is 2, ii is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 0 integers and a space-separated list of integers, a is a sorted list of integers.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `k` and `r`. The first line subtracts the product of 3 and the difference between the third and second elements of `a` from `k`. The second line assigns the third element of `a` to `r`. The values of `n`, `rem`, `y`, `i`, `ii`, and `a` remain unchanged. Stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
