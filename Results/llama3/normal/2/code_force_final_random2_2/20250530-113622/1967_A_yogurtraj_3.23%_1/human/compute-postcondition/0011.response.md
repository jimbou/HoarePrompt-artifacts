Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a space-separated list of integers. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is updated to its original value minus 2 times the difference between the second and first elements of `a`, `r` is updated to the second smallest integer in `a`, and `rem` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `k` is set to 0, `r` is updated to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is updated to `k % (i + 1)`, and `y` is updated to `n - 1 - i`.***
