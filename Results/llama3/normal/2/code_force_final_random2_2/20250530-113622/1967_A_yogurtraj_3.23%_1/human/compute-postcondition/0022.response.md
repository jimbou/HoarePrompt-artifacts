To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the variables and expressions involved in the print statement, given the initial state:

1. **n**: An integer.
2. **k**: 0.
3. **a**: A sorted list of integers.
4. **r**: The smallest integer in `a` plus `k` divided by `n` minus 1.
5. **rem**: `k` modulo `n` minus 1.
6. **y**: 1.
7. **ii**: 0 (not used in the print statement).

Given these initial states, let's calculate the value of the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y` step by step:

1. **r**: Since `k` is 0, `r` simplifies to the smallest integer in `a` minus 1 (because `k/n` is 0, and then you subtract 1).
2. **rem**: Since `k` is 0, `rem` is 0 (because 0 modulo any number is 0, and then you subtract 1, but since the modulo result is 0, it remains 0).

Now, let's substitute these values into the expression:

- `(r - 1)`: This is the smallest integer in `a` minus 2 (because we subtract 1 from `r`, which is already the smallest integer minus 1).
- `* n`: This multiplies the result by `n`.
- `+ 1`: Adds 1 to the result.
- `+ rem`: Since `rem` is 0, this doesn't change the result.
- `+ y`: Adds 1 to the result (because `y` is 1).

So, the expression simplifies to: `(smallest integer in a - 2) * n + 2`.

**Output: **(smallest integer in a - 2) * n + 2 (where n is the given integer and the smallest integer in a is the smallest integer in the sorted list a)**
