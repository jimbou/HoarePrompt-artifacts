To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, because the range starts from 0 and goes up to `n - 1`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 2.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 0, `ii` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 0 integers and a space-separated list of integers**
