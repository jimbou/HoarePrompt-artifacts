This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. It then processes each test case by sorting the integers and calculating a result value r based on the sorted integers and the value of k. If k is not exhausted after processing all integers, it adjusts the result value r accordingly. Finally, it prints the result value r for each test case, taking into account any remaining value of k and the number of integers. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input stream empty and the variables n, k, a, r, rem, y, and i undefined.
