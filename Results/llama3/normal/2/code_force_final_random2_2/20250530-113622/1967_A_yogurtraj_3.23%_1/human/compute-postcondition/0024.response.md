Postcondition: ***n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is the smallest integer in a plus k divided by n minus 1, rem is k modulo n minus 1, y is 1, ii is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a space-separated list of integers. If k is not equal to 0, then (r - 1) * n + 1 is printed where r is the last integer in a plus k divided by n. If k is 0, then (r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y is printed where r is the smallest integer in a plus k divided by n minus 1, rem is k modulo n minus 1, y is 1.***
