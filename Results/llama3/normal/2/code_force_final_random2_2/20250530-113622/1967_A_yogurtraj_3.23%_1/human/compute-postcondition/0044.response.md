The code prints the value of the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1`, where `r` is the (n-1)th smallest integer in `a` plus `k` divided by `n`.

Since `r` is the (n-1)th smallest integer in `a` plus `k` divided by `n`, we can rewrite it as `r = a[i] + k/n`, where `i` is `n-1`.

Substituting this value of `r` into the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1`, we get:

`(a[i] + k/n - 1) * n + 1`

Simplifying this expression, we get:

`a[i] * n + k - n + 1`

Since `i` is `n-1`, we can substitute `a[i]` with `a[n-1]`, which is the (n-1)th smallest integer in `a`.

So, the final expression becomes:

`a[n-1] * n + k - n + 1`

This expression represents the product of the (n-1)th smallest integer in `a` and `n`, plus `k` minus `n` plus 1.

Output: **a[n-1] * n + k - n + 1 (where a[n-1] is the (n-1)th smallest integer in a, k is not equal to 0, and n is an integer)**
