Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a space-separated list of integers. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is decreased, `r` is set to the second smallest integer in `a`, and `rem` is 0. Otherwise, `k` is set to 0, `r` is set to the smallest integer in `a` plus `k` divided by 1, `rem` is `k` modulo 1, and `y` is set to `n` minus 1.***
