The only variable in the loop head is variable  ii, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ii`. If `ii` is less than `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ii` is `n-1`, `int(input())` is greater than `n-1`. For the loop to execute again, `ii` must be `n` and `int(input())` must be greater than `n`. Also, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs, so stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is the (n-1)th smallest integer in a plus k divided by (n-1), rem is the remainder of k divided by (n-1), y is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a space-separated list of integers, i is n, ii is n, int(input()) is greater than n**
