Postcondition: **n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is the (n-1)th smallest integer in a plus k divided by (n-1), rem is the remainder of k divided by (n-1), y is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: 2 integers and a space-separated list of integers, i is n-1. If k is not equal to 0, the value of (r - 1) * n + 1 is printed, which is the value of the (n-1)th smallest integer in a plus k divided by n minus 1, multiplied by n plus 1. If k is equal to 0, the value of ((n-1)th smallest integer in a) * n + 1 + 1 is printed.**
