The code prints the result of the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1`, where `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n` and `n` is an integer.

Since `a` is a sorted list of integers, `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the list. The value of `k` is not specified, but it is not 0.

The expression `k // n` performs integer division, which means it rounds down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, `r` is the last element of the list `a` plus the result of the integer division of `k` by `n`.

The expression `(r - 1) * n + 1` subtracts 1 from `r`, multiplies the result by `n`, and then adds 1.

Output: **((a[n - 1] + k // n) - 1) * n + 1 (where a[n - 1] is the last element of the sorted list a, k is a non-zero integer, and n is an integer)**
