Output: **`n` is an integer, `k` is not 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, `rem` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `ii` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 0 integers and a space-separated list of integers, and this is printed: `(a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1`**
