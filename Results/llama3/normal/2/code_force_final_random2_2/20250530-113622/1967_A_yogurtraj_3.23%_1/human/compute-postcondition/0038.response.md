Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, k is 0, a is a sorted list of integers, r is the 3rd smallest integer in a plus k divided by 2, rem is the remainder of k divided by 2, y is n - 2, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: 2 integers and a space-separated list of integers**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been set to 0, and the value of `r` is the 3rd smallest integer in list `a` plus `k` divided by 2. The value of `rem` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2. The value of `y` is `n - 2`. The value of `i` is 1. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged. Stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: 2 integers and a space-separated list of integers.
