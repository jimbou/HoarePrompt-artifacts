The code prints the result of the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1`, where `r` is the last integer in the sorted list `a` plus `k` divided by `n`, and `n` is an integer.

Since `r` is the last integer in the sorted list `a` plus `k` divided by `n`, we can describe `r` as `r = a[-1] + k/n`, where `a[-1]` is the last element of the list `a`.

The expression `(r - 1) * n + 1` can be expanded as follows:

`(r - 1) * n + 1 = (a[-1] + k/n - 1) * n + 1`

Simplifying the expression, we get:

`(a[-1] + k/n - 1) * n + 1 = a[-1] * n + k - n + 1`

Since `k` is not equal to 0, the term `k - n` will be a non-zero integer.

Therefore, the output will be an integer value that depends on the values of `a[-1]`, `n`, and `k`.

Output: **a[-1] * n + k - n + 1 (where a[-1] is the last element of the sorted list a, n is an integer, and k is a non-zero integer)**
