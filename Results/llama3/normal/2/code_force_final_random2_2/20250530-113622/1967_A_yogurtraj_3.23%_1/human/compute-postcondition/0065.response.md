Postcondition: ***n is an integer that must be at least 3, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is an integer, rem is an integer, y is an integer, i is 2, ii is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 0 integers and a space-separated list of integers. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then k is 0, r is a[2] + k // 3, rem is k % 3, and y is n - 3. Otherwise, k is its original value minus 3 times the difference between the third and second elements of a, and r is the third element of a.***
