Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: 2 integers and a space-separated list of integers. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then k is 0, r is the 3rd smallest integer in a plus k divided by 2, rem is the remainder of k divided by 2, and y is n - 2. Otherwise, k is decreased by a non-negative value, r is the third smallest integer in a, rem is 0, and y is 0.***
