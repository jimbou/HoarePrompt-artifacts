The only variable in the loop head is variable ii, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable ii and the number of test cases. If ii is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, ii is 0, and the number of test cases is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, ii must be increased by 1, so ii is 1, and the number of test cases must be at least 1 more than the current number of test cases, so the number of test cases must be at least 2.
State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is the smallest integer in a plus k divided by n minus 1, rem is k modulo n minus 1, y is 1, ii is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: 2 integers and a space-separated list of integers. If k is not equal to 0, then (r - 1) * n + 1 is printed where r is the last integer in a plus k divided by n. If k is 0, then (r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y is printed where r is the smallest integer in a plus k divided by n minus 1, rem is k modulo n minus 1, y is 1.**
