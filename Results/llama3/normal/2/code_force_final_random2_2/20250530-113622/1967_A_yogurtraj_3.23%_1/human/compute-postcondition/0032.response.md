Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is the smallest integer in a, rem is 0, y is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: 2 integers and a space-separated list of integers, i is 0. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then k is 0, r is a[i] + k // (i + 1), rem is k % (i + 1), y is n - 1 - i. Otherwise, k is decreased by (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]), r is the (i + 2)nd smallest integer in a, rem is 0, y is 0.***
