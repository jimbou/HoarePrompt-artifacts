The value of `r` is updated to be the sum of the last element of the sorted list `a` and the integer division of `k` by `n`. The value of `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the sorted list `a`, and `k // n` is the integer division of `k` by `n`. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is not 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, `rem` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `ii` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 0 integers and a space-separated list of integers.**
