Postcondition: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 0, `ii` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 0 integers and a space-separated list of integers. The current value of `i` is such that the product of `i + 1` and the difference between the elements at indices `i + 1` and `i` in list `a` is greater than `k`.**
