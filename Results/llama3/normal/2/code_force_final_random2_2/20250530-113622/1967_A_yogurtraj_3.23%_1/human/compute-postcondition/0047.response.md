To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the variables and their values based on the initial state:

1. **n**: An integer, but its exact value isn't specified.
2. **k**: Initially 0.
3. **a**: A sorted list of integers, but the exact integers are not specified.
4. **r**: The (n-1)th smallest integer in `a` plus `k` divided by `(n-1)`. Since `k` is 0, `r` simplifies to the (n-1)th smallest integer in `a` divided by `(n-1)`.
5. **rem**: The remainder of `k` divided by `(n-1)`. Since `k` is 0, `rem` is also 0.
6. **y**: 1.
7. **i**: `n-1`.
8. **stdin**: Contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: 2 integers and a space-separated list of integers. However, this information about stdin does not directly affect the calculation of the print statement.

Given these values, let's calculate the print statement:

`print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)`

- **r**: The (n-1)th smallest integer in `a` divided by `(n-1)`. Let's denote the (n-1)th smallest integer in `a` as `x`. So, `r = x / (n-1)`.
- **rem**: 0.
- **y**: 1.

Substituting these values into the print statement:

`print(((x / (n-1)) - 1) * n + 1 + 0 + 1)`

Simplifying:

`print((x - (n-1)) * n / (n-1) + 2)`

Further simplification shows that the expression can be reduced, but without knowing the exact values of `x` and `n`, we cannot compute a numerical value. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **((x - (n-1)) * n / (n-1) + 2) where x is the (n-1)th smallest integer in list a and n is an integer**
