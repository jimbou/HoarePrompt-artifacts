Postcondition: ***n is an integer that must be at least 2, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is the smallest integer in a, rem is 0, y is 0, i is 1, ii is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 0 integers and a space-separated list of integers. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then k is 0, r is a[i] + k // (i + 1), rem is k % (i + 1), y is n - 1 - i. Otherwise, k is an integer equal to its original value minus (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]), r is the integer a[i + 1], rem is 0, y is 0.***
