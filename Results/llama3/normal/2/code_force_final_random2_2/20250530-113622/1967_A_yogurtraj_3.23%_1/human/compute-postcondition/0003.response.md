Postcondition: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a space-separated list of integers. The current value of `i` is 0 and the current value of `k` is less than the product of `i+1` and the difference between the elements at indices `i+1` and `i` in the list `a`.**
