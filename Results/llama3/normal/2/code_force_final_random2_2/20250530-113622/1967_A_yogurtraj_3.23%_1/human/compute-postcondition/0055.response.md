Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 0, `ii` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 0 integers and a space-separated list of integers. The product of the difference between the element at index `i+1` and the element at index `i` in `a` and `i+1` is less than or equal to `k`***
