To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` has increased, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **n is an integer that must be at least 3, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is an integer, rem is an integer, y is an integer, i is 2, ii is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 0 integers and a space-separated list of integers.**
