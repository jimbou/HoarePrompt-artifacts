Output State: **n is an integer that must be at least 2, k is 0, a is a sorted list of integers, r is the smallest integer in a plus k divided by i plus 1, rem is k modulo i plus 1, y is n minus 1 minus i, i is 0, ii is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 0 integers and a space-separated list of integers.**

In this final state, the value of `k` has been reset to 0. The value of `r` has been updated to be the smallest integer in `a` plus `k` divided by `i + 1`. The value of `rem` has been updated to be `k` modulo `i + 1`. The value of `y` has been updated to be `n - 1 - i`. The value of `i` remains 0. The value of `ii` remains `n`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 0 integers and a space-separated list of integers.
