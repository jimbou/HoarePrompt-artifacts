Postcondition: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is the smallest integer in a, rem is 0, y is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: 2 integers and a space-separated list of integers. The current value of i is 0. The difference between the (i+1)th and ith elements of a, multiplied by (i+1), is greater than k.**
