Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: 2 integers and a space-separated list of integers, i is 1, r is the 3rd smallest integer in a, k is decreased by a non-negative value, y is 0, rem is 0**

The code snippet modifies the values of `k`, `r`, and `y`. The value of `k` is decreased by a non-negative value, which is the product of `(i + 1)` and `(a[i + 1] - a[i])`. The value of `r` is set to the 3rd smallest integer in the sorted list `a`, which is `a[i + 1]`. The value of `y` is set to 0. The value of `rem` is 0. The value of `i` is 1. The values of `n`, `a`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged.
