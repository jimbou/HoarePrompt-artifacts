You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: an integer (greater than 0).
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        if (n == k) :
            print('YES')
            #This is printed: YES
            print(1)
            #This is printed: 1
            print(n)
            #This is printed: k (where k is the value of k which is equal to n)
        else :
            if (k - 1 < n - k + 1) :
                print('YES')
                #This is printed: YES
                print(2)
                #This is printed: 2
                print(n - k + 1, 1)
                #This is printed: n - k + 1 (where n is an integer greater than 0 and k is an integer such that n is greater than or equal to k and n is not equal to k), 1
            else :
                print('NO')
                #This is printed: NO
            #State: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, stdin is empty, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `n` is not equal to `k`. If `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the values `n - k + 1` and 1 are printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
        #State: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, stdin is empty, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `n` is equal to `k`, 'YES' is printed, 1 is printed, and the value of `n` which is equal to `k` is printed. If `n` is not equal to `k`, and `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the values `n - k + 1` and 1 are printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
    #State: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, stdin is empty. If `n` is less than `k`, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, then if `n` is equal to `k`, 'YES', 1, and `n` are printed. If `n` is not equal to `k` and `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, 'YES', 2, `n - k + 1`, and 1 are printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, stdin is empty. The current value of `n` is less than the current value of `k`, and 'NO' is being printed

Case_2: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, stdin is empty, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1`, and 'NO' is being printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
