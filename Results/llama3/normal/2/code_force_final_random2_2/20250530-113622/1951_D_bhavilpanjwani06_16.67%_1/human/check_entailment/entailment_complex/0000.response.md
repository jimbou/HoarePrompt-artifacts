Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether it is possible for Bob to set up the store such that Alice buys exactly k jewels. The program checks the conditions based on the relationship between n and k, and prints the appropriate output.

The program first checks if n is less than k, in which case it prints 'NO' because it is impossible for Alice to buy k jewels with less than k coins.

If n is greater than or equal to k, the program checks if n is equal to k. If so, it prints 'YES', 1, and the value of n (which is equal to k), because Alice can buy k jewels with k coins.

If n is not equal to k, the program checks if k - 1 is less than n - k + 1. If so, it prints 'YES', 2, n - k + 1, and 1, because Alice can buy k jewels with the given prices.

If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints 'NO', indicating that it is impossible for Bob to set up the store such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and prints the appropriate output based on the relationship between n and k.

Correctness: **True**
