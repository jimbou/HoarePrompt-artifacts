Functionality: **Determines if a given integer `n` is greater than or equal to another integer `k`, and if so, prints 'YES' along with specific values based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. If `n` is less than `k`, prints 'NO'. If `n` equals `k`, prints 'YES', 1, and the value of `n` (which is equal to `k`). If `n` is greater than `k` and `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, prints 'YES', 2, `n - k + 1`, and 1. Otherwise, prints 'NO'.**
