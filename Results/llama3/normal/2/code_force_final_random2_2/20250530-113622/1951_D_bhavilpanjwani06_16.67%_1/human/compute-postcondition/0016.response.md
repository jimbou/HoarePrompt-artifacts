Based on the precondition, the value of `n` is an integer greater than 0, and the value of `k` is an integer. The current value of `k` minus 1 is less than the current value of `n` minus `k` plus 1, and 'YES' is being printed.

However, the print statement `print(2)` does not depend on the values of `n` and `k`. It simply prints the integer 2.

Output: **2**
