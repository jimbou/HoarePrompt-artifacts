Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can set up the store to ensure Alice buys exactly k jewels. The program checks the conditions based on the relationship between the number of coins Alice has (n) and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy (k).

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. If n < k, it prints 'NO' because Alice doesn't have enough coins to buy k jewels.
2. If n == k, it prints 'YES', 1, and the value of n (which is equal to k). This is because Alice can buy exactly k jewels if the price of each jewel is 1.
3. If n > k and k - 1 < n - k + 1, it prints 'YES', 2, n - k + 1, and 1. This is because Alice can buy k jewels if the price of the first jewel is n - k + 1 and the price of the second jewel is 1. The condition k - 1 < n - k + 1 ensures that Alice can't buy more than k jewels.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'NO'.

The execution summary correctly describes the program's behavior, and the program's logic is correct based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
