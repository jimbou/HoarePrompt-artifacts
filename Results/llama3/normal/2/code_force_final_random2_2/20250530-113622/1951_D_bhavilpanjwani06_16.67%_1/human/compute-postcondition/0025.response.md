Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, stdin is empty. If `n` is less than `k`, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, then if `n` is equal to `k`, 'YES', 1, and `n` are printed. If `n` is not equal to `k` and `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, 'YES', 2, `n - k + 1`, and 1 are printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
