Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, stdin is empty, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `n` is not equal to `k`. If `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the values `n - k + 1` and 1 are printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
