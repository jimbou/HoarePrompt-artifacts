Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, stdin is empty, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `n` is equal to `k`, 'YES' is printed, 1 is printed, and the value of `n` which is equal to `k` is printed. If `n` is not equal to `k`, and `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the values `n - k + 1` and 1 are printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
