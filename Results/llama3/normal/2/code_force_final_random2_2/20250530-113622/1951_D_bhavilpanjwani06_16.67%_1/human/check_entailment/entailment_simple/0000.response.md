Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles all possible cases based on the values of `n` and `k`. 

- If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels with less than `k` coins.

- If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES', 1, and `n` because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels with `k` coins at a price of 1 coin per jewel.

- If `n` is greater than `k` and `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, it prints 'YES', 2, `n - k + 1`, and 1. This is because Alice can buy `k - 1` jewels at a price of `n - k + 1` coins per jewel, and then buy 1 more jewel at a price of 1 coin per jewel, resulting in a total of `k` jewels.

- If `n` is greater than `k` and `k - 1` is not less than `n - k + 1`, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels with the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
