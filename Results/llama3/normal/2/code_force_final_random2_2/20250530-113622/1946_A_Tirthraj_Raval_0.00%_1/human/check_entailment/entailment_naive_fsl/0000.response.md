Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the array has an even number of elements. In this case, the median is the average of the two middle elements, but the program only considers the first middle element.

For example, if the input is [1, 2, 3, 4], the program will output 1, but the correct output should be 2, because the median of [1, 2, 3, 4] is 2.5, and increasing the first middle element (2) by 1 will increase the median to 3.
