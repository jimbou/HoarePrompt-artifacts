Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). t is an integer.**

The first line of the code reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `t`. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, each with two lines, reading one integer will reduce the number of test cases by one. The value of `t` will be the integer read from stdin, which is the number of test cases minus one. The rest of the test cases remain in stdin, each with two lines as described in the initial state.
