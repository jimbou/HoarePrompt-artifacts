Reasoning:
The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
3. It sorts the array `a` in ascending order using the `sort()` method.
4. It calculates the index `p` of the median element using the formula `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. This is correct because the median is the middle element in an odd-length array, and the formula takes into account the 0-based indexing in Python.
5. It counts the occurrences of the median element using the `count()` method and stores the result in `res`.
6. Finally, it prints the result `res`, which is the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required steps to solve the problem. The execution summary also confirms that the program processes all test cases and leaves the input stream empty.

Correctness: **True**
