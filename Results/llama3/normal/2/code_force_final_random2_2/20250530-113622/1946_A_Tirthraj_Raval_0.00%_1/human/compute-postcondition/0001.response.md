The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. So for the loop to be executed  the variable `t` must be greater than 0 and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `t` must be greater than 0**
