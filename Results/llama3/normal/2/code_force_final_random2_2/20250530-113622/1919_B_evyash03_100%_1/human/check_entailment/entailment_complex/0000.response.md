Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting a given array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program calculates the absolute difference between the number of "+" characters (which represent 1 in the array) and the number of "-" characters (which represent -1 in the array) in the input string. This difference represents the minimum possible penalty, as it corresponds to the optimal way of splitting the array into subarrays with zero sum.

The program's logic is correct because:

* It correctly counts the number of "+" characters in the input string.
* It correctly calculates the number of "-" characters by subtracting the count of "+" characters from the length of the string.
* It correctly returns the absolute difference between the counts of "+" and "-" characters, which represents the minimum possible penalty.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
