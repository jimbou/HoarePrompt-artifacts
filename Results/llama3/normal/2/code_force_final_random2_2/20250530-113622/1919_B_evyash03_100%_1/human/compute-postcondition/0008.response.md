The only variable in the loop head is `char` and `expression`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `expression`. If `expression` has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `expression` is not empty, `length` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of `expression`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `expression` must have at least 2 characters and the `char` is the second character in the `expression`. If the second character in the expression is "+", then `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` is 1.
State: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" that has at least 2 characters, `length` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of `expression`, `count` is 2 if the second character in the expression is "+", otherwise `count` is 1, `char` is the second character in the `expression`.**
