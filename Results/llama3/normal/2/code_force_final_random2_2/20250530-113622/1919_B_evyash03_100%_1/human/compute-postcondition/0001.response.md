The only variables in the loop head are variables  char and expression, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the expression. If the expression is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, expression is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", length is a non-negative integer equal to the length of expression, count is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to expression is not empty and char is the first character in the expression.
State: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" that is not empty, `length` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of `expression`, `count` is 0, char is the first character in the expression**
