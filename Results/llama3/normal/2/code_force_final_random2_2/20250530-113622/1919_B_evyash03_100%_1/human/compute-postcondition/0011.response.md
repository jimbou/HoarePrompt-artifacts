Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" that has at least 3 characters, `length` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of `expression`, `count` is the number of "+" characters in the `expression`.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `expression` variable will still be a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters, but it will have at least 3 characters. The `length` variable will still be equal to the length of the `expression` string. The `count` variable will be equal to the number of "+" characters in the `expression` string.
