Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" that has at least 2 characters, `length` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of `expression`, `count` is 3 if the second character in the expression is "+", otherwise `count` is 2, `char` is the second character in the `expression`.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1. If the second character in the expression is "+", then `count` is now 3, otherwise it is 2. The values of `expression`, `length`, and `char` remain unchanged.
