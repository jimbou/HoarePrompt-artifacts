Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string and returning the absolute difference between the counts. This approach is correct because the penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and the optimal way to split the array is to group all '+' characters together and all '-' characters together. The program's logic is sound, and it handles all possible cases correctly.

The program's logic can be explained as follows:

*   The function `func_1` takes an expression and its length as input.
*   It initializes a count variable to 0.
*   It iterates over each character in the expression. If the character is '+', it increments the count.
*   After the loop, it calculates the number of '-' characters by subtracting the count from the length of the expression.
*   It returns the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters.

This approach ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty for any given input string.
