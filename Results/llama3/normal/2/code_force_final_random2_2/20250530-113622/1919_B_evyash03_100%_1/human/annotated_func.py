#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", length is a non-negative integer equal to the length of expression.
    count = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            count += 1
        
    #State: `expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" that has at least 3 characters, `length` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of `expression`, `count` is the number of "+" characters in the `expression`.
    sub = length - count
    return abs(sub - count)
    #The program returns the absolute difference between the number of "+" characters in the expression and a number between 0 and the length of the expression, inclusive.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the absolute difference between the number of "+" characters in a given string expression and the number of "-" characters, which is derived from the length of the expression and the count of "+" characters.
