Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string expression and its length as input. It counts the number of "+" characters in the expression and calculates the number of "-" characters by subtracting the count of "+" characters from the length of the expression. The function then returns the absolute difference between the count of "+" characters and the count of "-" characters.

The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the `func_1` function. The function correctly calculates the absolute difference between the number of "+" characters and the number of "-" characters in the given string expression.

However, the problem statement requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting the array into non-empty subarrays. The given program does not explicitly split the array into subarrays or calculate the penalty for each subarray. Instead, it directly calculates the absolute difference between the count of "+" characters and the count of "-" characters.

Despite this, the given program is actually correct. The reason is that the minimum possible penalty can be achieved by splitting the array into subarrays of length 1, where each subarray contains either a "+" or a "-" character. In this case, the penalty for each subarray is simply the absolute value of its sum, which is 1 for "+" characters and 1 for "-" characters. Therefore, the total penalty is equal to the absolute difference between the count of "+" characters and the count of "-" characters.

Correctness: **True**
