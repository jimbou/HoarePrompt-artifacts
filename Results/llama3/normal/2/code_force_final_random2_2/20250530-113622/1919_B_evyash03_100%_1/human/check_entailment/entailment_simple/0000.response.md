Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that the sum of the penalties of the subarrays is minimized. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `expression` and an integer `length` as input. It iterates over the characters in the string, counting the number of "+" characters. Then, it calculates the absolute difference between the number of "+" characters and the number of "-" characters (which is `length - count`).

The key insight here is that the optimal way to split the array is to group consecutive "+" characters together and consecutive "-" characters together. This is because the penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, so grouping consecutive characters of the same sign together minimizes the penalty.

The program's calculation of `abs(sub - count)` is equivalent to calculating the absolute value of the sum of the array, which is the minimum possible penalty. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
