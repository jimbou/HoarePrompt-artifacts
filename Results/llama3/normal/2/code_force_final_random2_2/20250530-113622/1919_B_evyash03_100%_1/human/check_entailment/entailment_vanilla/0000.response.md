Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the minimum possible penalty that can be achieved by splitting an array of '+' and '-' characters into subarrays. The penalty of a subarray is calculated as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes an expression (a string of '+' and '-' characters) and its length as input. It then counts the number of '+' characters in the expression and calculates the number of '-' characters by subtracting the count of '+' characters from the length of the expression. Finally, it returns the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters.

The main part of the program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the length of the expression and the expression itself. It then calls the `func_1` function with the expression and its length as arguments and prints the result.

The key insight here is that the minimum possible penalty is achieved when the subarrays are split such that the sum of each subarray is either 0 or as close to 0 as possible. This is because the penalty of a subarray is proportional to the absolute value of its sum.

The `func_1` function achieves this by counting the number of '+' and '-' characters in the expression and returning the absolute difference between these counts. This difference represents the minimum possible penalty, because it is the smallest possible sum that can be achieved by splitting the expression into subarrays.

Therefore, the given program is correct, and the answer is:

Correctness: **True**
