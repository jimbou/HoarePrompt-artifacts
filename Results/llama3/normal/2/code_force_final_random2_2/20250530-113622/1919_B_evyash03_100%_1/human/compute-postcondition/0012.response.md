Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `sub` is assigned the value of `length - count`.
2. `length` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of `expression`, which has at least 3 characters.
3. `count` is the number of "+" characters in the `expression`.

Since `expression` has at least 3 characters, `length` is at least 3. Let's consider the possible values of `count`:

* If `expression` has only "+" characters, `count` is equal to `length`.
* If `expression` has only "-" characters, `count` is 0.
* If `expression` has a mix of "+" and "-" characters, `count` is between 0 and `length`.

Now, let's calculate the value of `sub`:

* If `count` is equal to `length`, `sub` is 0.
* If `count` is 0, `sub` is equal to `length`.
* If `count` is between 0 and `length`, `sub` is between 0 and `length`.

In summary, `sub` is assigned a value between 0 and `length`, inclusive.

Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" that has at least 3 characters, `length` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of `expression`, `count` is the number of "+" characters in the `expression`, and `sub` is an integer between 0 and `length`, inclusive.**
