Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect because it only handles the cases where n is 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, the problem statement specifies that n can be any integer between 1 and 20. The program does not provide a general solution for all possible values of n.

In the else clause, the program prints 'No esta en el rango', which is not the correct output according to the problem statement. The program should print a 2n x 2n checkerboard for any value of n between 1 and 20.

Correctness: **False**
