Output State: **`casos` is at least 1, `c` is 0, `n` is an integer, stdin contains one input less than before**

In this output state, the value of `casos` remains at least 1, and the value of `c` remains 0. The new variable `n` is assigned the value of an integer from the input. Since `input()` accepts an input, the stdin now contains one input less than before.
