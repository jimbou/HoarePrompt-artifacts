Reasoning: 
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly generate the checkerboard pattern for all values of n. The program only handles specific cases for n = 1, 2, 3, and 4, and for any other value of n, it prints "No esta en el rango" which is not the expected output. The program should be able to generate the checkerboard pattern for any value of n within the given range (1 <= n <= 20).

Correctness: **False**
