Output State: **`casos` is at least 2, `c` is 1, `n` is an integer less than before, stdin contains no input. If `n` is 1, then '##' is printed. If `n` is 2, then '##..' is printed, and '..##' is printed. If `n` is 3, then '##..##' is printed five times, and '..##..' is printed five times. If `n` is 4, then '##..##..' is printed six times and '..##..##' is printed four times. If `n` is not 1, 2, 3 or 4, then 'No esta en el rango' is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to an integer less than before, which is obtained from the input. The values of `casos` and `c` remain unchanged. The stdin is now empty, as it has been used to obtain the value of `n`. The printing of specific patterns or messages depends on the value of `n`, which is now determined.
