Output State: **`casos` is at least 3, `c` is 2, `n` is an integer, stdin contains no input.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to `n`. Since stdin contains no input, the value of `n` is unknown. The values of `casos` and `c` are not affected by the code. Therefore, the output state is that `casos` is at least 3, `c` is 2, and `n` is an integer, with no input in stdin.
