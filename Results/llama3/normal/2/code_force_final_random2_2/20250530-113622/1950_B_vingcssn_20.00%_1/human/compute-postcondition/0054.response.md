Postcondition: ***`casos` is at least 1, `c` is 0, `n` is an integer and is not equal to 1 and is not equal to 2. If `n` is 3, then '##..##' is printed five times, and '..##..' is printed five times. If `n` is 4, then '##..##..' is printed six times and '..##..##' is printed four times. If `n` is not 3 or 4, then 'No esta en el rango' is printed. In all cases, stdin contains one input less than before.***
