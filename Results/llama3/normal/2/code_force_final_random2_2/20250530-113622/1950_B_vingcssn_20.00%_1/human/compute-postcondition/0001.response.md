The only variables in the loop head are variables  c and casos, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `casos`. If `casos` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 inclusive, so it needs to be adjusted to `casos` is at least 1 and c is now 0. 
State: **`casos` is at least 1, `c` is 0**
