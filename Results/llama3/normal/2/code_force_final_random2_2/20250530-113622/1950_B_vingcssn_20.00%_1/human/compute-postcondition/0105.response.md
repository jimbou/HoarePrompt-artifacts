To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for c in range(0, casos):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `c` is less than `casos`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `c` is 1, and `casos` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `c` must be incremented by 1, so `c` becomes 2. Since `casos` is at least 2, it must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables, `n` and `stdin`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`casos` is at least 3, `c` is 2, `n` is an integer less than before, stdin contains no input.**
