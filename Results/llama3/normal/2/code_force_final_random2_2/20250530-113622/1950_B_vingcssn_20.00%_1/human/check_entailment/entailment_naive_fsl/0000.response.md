Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. It only handles the cases where n is 1, 2, 3, or 4, and for any other value of n, it prints "No esta en el rango" (which means "Not in the range" in Spanish). However, the problem description does not specify that n should only be one of these values. In fact, it states that n can be any integer between 1 and 20.

For example, if n is 5, the program will print "No esta en el rango", which is not the correct output according to the problem description. The correct output for n = 5 would be a 10x10 checkerboard made of 2x2 squares alternating '#' and '.'.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases as specified in the problem description.
