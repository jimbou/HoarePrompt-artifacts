The only variables in the loop head are variables  c and casos, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c` and `casos`. If `c` is less than `casos`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 0, `casos` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `c` must be increased by 1, so `c` is 1 and `casos` must be greater than 1.
State: **`casos` is at least 2, `c` is 1, `n` is an integer, stdin contains one input less than before. If `n` is 1, then '##' is printed. If `n` is 2, then '##..' is printed, and '..##' is printed. If `n` is 3, then '##..##' is printed five times, and '..##..' is printed five times. If `n` is 4, then '##..##..' is printed six times and '..##..##' is printed four times. If `n` is not 1, 2, 3 or 4, then 'No esta en el rango' is printed.**
