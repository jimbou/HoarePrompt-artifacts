Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 inclusive, stdin contains `casos` lines each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20)
Code of the loop:
for c in range(0, casos):
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print('##')
        print('##')
    elif n == 2:
        print('##..')
        print('##..')
        print('..##')
        print('..##')
    elif n == 3:
        print('##..##')
        print('##..##')
        print('..##..')
        print('..##..')
        print('##..##')
        print('##..##')
    elif n == 4:
        print('##..##..')
        print('##..##..')
        print('..##..##')
        print('..##..##')
        print('##..##..')
        print('##..##..')
        print('..##..##')
        print('..##..##')
    else:
        print('No esta en el rango')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`casos` is at least 1, `c` is 0, `n` is an integer, stdin contains one input less than before. If `n` is 1, then '##' is printed. If `n` is 2, then '##..' is printed, and '..##' is printed. If `n` is 3, then '##..##' is printed five times, and '..##..' is printed five times. If `n` is 4, then '##..##..' is printed six times and '..##..##' is printed four times. If `n` is not 1, 2, 3 or 4, then 'No esta en el rango' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `casos` is at least 2, `c` is 1, `n` is an integer less than before, stdin contains no input. If `n` is 1, then '##' is printed. If `n` is not 1, then the original print statements for `n` are executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`casos` is at least 3, `c` is 2, `n` is an integer, stdin contains no input. If `n` is 1, '##' is printed. If `n` is 2, the strings '##..' and '..##' are printed twice. If `n` is 3, the strings '##..##', '##..##', '..##..', '..##..', '##..##', and '##..##' are printed. If `n` is 4, the strings '##..##..', '##..##..', '..##..##', '..##..##', '##..##..', '##..##..', '##..##..', '..##..##', and '..##..##' are printed. Otherwise, the string 'No esta en el rango' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
