Reasoning:

The given program is designed to output a 2n x 2n checkerboard made of 2x2 squares alternating '#' and '.' characters, with the top-left cell being '#'. The program takes an integer n as input and uses if-elif statements to handle different values of n.

However, the program only handles specific values of n (1, 2, 3, and 4) and does not provide a general solution for all possible values of n. For n > 4, the program prints 'No esta en el rango', which is not the expected output.

A correct solution would involve using loops to generate the checkerboard pattern for any given value of n. The program should be able to handle all values of n within the specified range (1 <= n <= 20).

Correctness: **False**
