Output State: **`casos` is at least 20, `c` is 19, `n` is an integer, stdin contains no input. If `n` is 1, '##' is printed. If `n` is 2, the strings '##..' and '..##' are printed twice. If `n` is 3, the strings '##..##', '##..##', '..##..', '..##..', '##..##', and '##..##' are printed. If `n` is 4, the strings '##..##..', '##..##..', '..##..##', '..##..##', '##..##..', '##..##..', '##..##..', '..##..##', and '..##..##' are printed. Otherwise, the string 'No esta en el rango' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `casos` is at least 20, indicating that the loop has executed 20 times. The variable `c` is 19, which is the last value it takes after the loop finishes executing. The variable `n` is still an integer, but its value is not specified. The standard input `stdin` contains no input, as all the input has been consumed by the loop. The output depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is 1, the string '##' is printed. If `n` is 2, the strings '##..' and '..##' are printed twice. If `n` is 3, the strings '##..##', '##..##', '..##..', '..##..', '##..##', and '##..##' are printed. If `n` is 4, the strings '##..##..', '##..##..', '..##..##', '..##..##', '##..##..', '##..##..', '##..##..', '..##..##', and '..##..##' are printed. If `n` is not 1, 2, 3, or 4, the string 'No esta en el rango' is printed.
