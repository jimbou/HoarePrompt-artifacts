To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `char` and `password`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `password`. If `password` has at least 3 characters, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `password` has at least 2 characters, and `char` is the second character in the `password`.

For the loop to execute again, `password` must have at least 3 characters, and `char` must be the third character in the `password`.

State: **password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 3 characters, char is the third character in the password. If char is a digit, then digits is a list containing the first three characters of the password and letters is an empty list. If char is not a digit, then digits is a list containing the first character of the password and the second character of the password, and letters is a list containing the second character of the password and the third character of the password.**
