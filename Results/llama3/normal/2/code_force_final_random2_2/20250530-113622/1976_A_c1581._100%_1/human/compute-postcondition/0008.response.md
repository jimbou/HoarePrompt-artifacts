If char is a digit, then digits is a list containing the first three characters of the password and letters is an empty list.

In this output state, the code has appended the second character of the password (char) to the list of digits. If char is a digit, then the list of digits now contains the first three characters of the password. If char is not a digit, then the list of digits now contains the first character of the password and the second character of the password. The list of letters remains empty in both cases. The password and char variables remain unchanged.
