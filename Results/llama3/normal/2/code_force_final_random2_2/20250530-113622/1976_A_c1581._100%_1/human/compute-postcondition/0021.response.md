According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the list `digits`. If `i` is less than the length of `digits`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `digits` has at least 1 digit. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1. The condition that either `i` is equal to or greater than the second last index of the `digits` list or if `i` is less than the second last index of the `digits` list then the digit at index `i` is less than or equal to the digit at index `i+1` must still hold. Since `i` is 1, it is less than the second last index of the `digits` list (which is at least 1), so the digit at index 1 must be less than or equal to the digit at index 2.
