Functionality: This function checks if a given password meets a specific format. It accepts a string password consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The function returns True if the password is already sorted with digits first in ascending order followed by letters in ascending order, and False otherwise. The function also checks if the list of digits is sorted in ascending order and if the last digit is not greater than any letter in the password. If these conditions are not met, the function returns False.
