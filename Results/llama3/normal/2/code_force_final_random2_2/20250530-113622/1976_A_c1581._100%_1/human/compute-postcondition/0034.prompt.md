You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, digits is a list containing all the digits in the password, letters is a list containing all the letters in the password.
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
        
    #State: password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, digits is a sorted list containing all the digits in the password that must have at least len(digits) digits, letters is a sorted list containing all the letters in the password. If the list of digits is not sorted in ascending order or if the last digit is greater than any letter in the password, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function continues its execution.
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if (sortedPassword == password) :
        return True
        #The program returns True, indicating that the password is already sorted with digits first in ascending order followed by letters in ascending order.
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False, indicating that the password does not meet the desired format, where all digits come first in ascending order, followed by all letters in ascending order.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, digits is a sorted list containing all the digits in the password that must have at least len(digits) digits, letters is a sorted list containing all the letters in the password. If the list of digits is not sorted in ascending order or if the last digit is greater than any letter in the password, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function continues its execution.

Case_2: The program returns True, indicating that the password is already sorted with digits first in ascending order followed by letters in ascending order.

Case_3: The program returns False, indicating that the password does not meet the desired format, where all digits come first in ascending order, followed by all letters in ascending order.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
