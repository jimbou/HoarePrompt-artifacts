Reasoning:

The given program is designed to check if a password string meets certain conditions, specifically that it consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with no digit coming after a letter, and all digits and letters being sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a password string as input and checks these conditions. It first separates the digits and letters into two lists, sorts them, and then checks if the sorted lists match the original password string. If they do, the function returns `True`, indicating that the password is strong; otherwise, it returns `False`.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The condition `if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:` is unnecessary and incorrect. This condition checks if the current digit is greater than the next digit, but this is already handled by the `sort()` function, which sorts the digits in ascending order. Moreover, this condition can cause the function to return `False` even if the password is strong, because it checks if the last digit is greater than the first letter, which is not a valid condition.

Additionally, the program does not check if the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. It assumes that the input password will only contain these characters, but it does not validate this assumption.

Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
