The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `digits`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `digits`. If `i` is less than the length of `digits`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the length of `digits` minus 1, `digits` has at least 2 digits. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` must be equal to the length of `digits` and `digits` must have at least 3 digits.
State: **password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, digits is a sorted list containing all the digits in the password that must have at least 3 digits, letters is a sorted list containing all the letters in the password, i is equal to the length of digits**
