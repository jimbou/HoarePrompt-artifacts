Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `length` is 30, `i` is 29, `x` is an integer, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, `flag` is 0, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings where each element at index `j` is '1' if the bit at position `j` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, '0' otherwise, except for the last element which is '-1'. Either `flag` is 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'***
