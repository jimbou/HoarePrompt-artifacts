Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, length is 30, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, i is 0, x is an integer, s is a list containing 30 strings where s[i] is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position i, otherwise '0', the current value of flag is 1, and also the condition that flag is not 0 or s[i] is not equal to s[i + 1] or (s[i] is not '1') is still true***
