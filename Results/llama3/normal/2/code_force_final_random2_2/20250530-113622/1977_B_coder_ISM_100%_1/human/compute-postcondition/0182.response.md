State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `length` is 30, `i` is less than 29, `x` is an integer, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially. `s` is a list containing 30 strings where each element at index `j` is '1' if the bit at position `j` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, '0' otherwise. If `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` is '0', then the element at index `i` in `s` is updated to '1' and `flag` is set to 0. If `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` is '1', then the element at index `i` in `s` is updated to '0' and `flag` is still 1. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is '1' and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i+1]`, then the element at index `i` in `s` is updated to '-1' and `flag` is set to 1. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is '1' and `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i+1]`, then `s` remains unchanged. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is '0', then `s` remains unchanged.**
