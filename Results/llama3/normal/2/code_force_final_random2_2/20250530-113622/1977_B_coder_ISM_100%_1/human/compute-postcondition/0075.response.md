Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, `i` is 0, `x` is an integer, `s` is a list containing one string '1'. The current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i` (i.e., the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and 2 raised to the power of `i` is not zero).**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer greater than 1. The value of `nalla` remains 1. The value of `length` remains 30. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains at least 1 fewer than initially. The value of `i` remains 0. The value of `x` remains an integer with a bit set at the position `i`. The list `s` now contains one string '1'.
