This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case is a single positive integer x. For each test case, it converts the integer to its binary representation, modifies the binary string by applying a set of rules, and then prints the length of the modified binary string and the string itself. The rules involve flipping bits, inserting a new bit, and swapping bits under certain conditions. The function processes all test cases and prints the modified binary strings and their lengths.
