Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `length` is 30, `i` is 30, `x` is an integer, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, `flag` is 0, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings where each element at index j is '1' if the bit at position j in the binary representation of x is 1, and '0' otherwise.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `length` is 30, `i` is less than 29, `x` is an integer, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially. `s` is a list containing 30 strings where each element at index `j` is '1' if the bit at position `j` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, '0' otherwise. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]` and `s[i]` is '1', then `s[i]` is updated to '-1' and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1, then the element at index `i` in `s` is '0'. If `flag` is 0, then either `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `length` is 30, `i` is less than 30, `x` is an integer, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially. `s` is a list containing 30 strings where each element at index `j` is '1' if the bit at position `j` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, '0' otherwise. If `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` is '0', then the element at index `i` in `s` is updated to '1' and `flag` is set to 0. If `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` is '1', then the element at index `i` in `s` is updated to '0' and `flag` is still 1. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is '1' and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i+1]`, then the element at index `i` in `s` is updated to '-1' and `flag` is set to 1. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is '1' and `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i+1]`, then `s` remains unchanged. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is '0', then `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, length is 30, i is less than 29, x is an integer, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, s is a list containing 30 strings where each element at index j is '1' if the bit at position j in the binary representation of x is 1, '0' otherwise. If flag is 0, the element at index i in s is '-1'. If flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', then the element at index i in s is updated to '1' and flag is set to 0. If flag is 1 and s[i] is '1' and s[i] is equal to s[i+1], then the element at index i in s is '-1' and flag is set to 1. If flag is 1 and s[i] is '1' but s[i] is not equal to s[i+1], then the element at index i in s is updated to '0' and flag is still 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
