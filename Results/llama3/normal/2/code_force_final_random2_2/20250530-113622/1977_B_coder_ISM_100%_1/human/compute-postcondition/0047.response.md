Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0, nalla is 0, length is 30, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, i is less than 30 and greater than or equal to 1, x is an integer, s is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1', '0' or '-1' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of x. If flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i] is equal to s[i + 1], then s[i] is '-1' and flag is 1. If flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', then s[i] is '1' and flag is 0. If flag is 1 and s[i] is not '0', then s[i] is '0' and flag is 0. If none of the above conditions are met, then flag and s[i] remain unchanged.***
