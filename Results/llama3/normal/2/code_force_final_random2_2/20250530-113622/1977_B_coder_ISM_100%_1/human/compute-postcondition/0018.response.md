Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, `i` is 29, `x` is an integer, `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`, `flag` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `flag` which is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
