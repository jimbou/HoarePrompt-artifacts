Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, length is either 30 or 31, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, i is 29, x is an integer, s is a list containing either 29 or 30 strings. If flag is 1 and s[29] is '0', then length is 30, s is a list containing 29 strings where the last element is '1', and flag is 0. Otherwise, length is 31, s is a list containing 30 strings. If flag is 1, then s[29] is '0', s[30] is '1', and the values of s[j] for j not equal to i and 29 are either '0' or '1' based on the bits set in x, and flag is 1 if s[i] is '0' and 0 if s[i] is not '0'. If flag is 0, then s is a list containing 29 strings where s[i] is '0' and the rest of the strings are either '1' or '0' depending on the value of x and the initial value of flag. Additionally, either flag is 0 or s[29] is not '0'.***
