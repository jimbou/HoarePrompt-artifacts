Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `length` is 30, `i` is less than 29, `x` is an integer, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially. `s` is a list containing 30 strings where each element at index `j` is '1' if the bit at position `j` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, '0' otherwise. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]` and `s[i]` is '1', then `s[i]` is updated to '-1' and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1, then the element at index `i` in `s` is '0'. If `flag` is 0, then either `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'.***
