Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, `i` is 0. `x` is an integer, if the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, then `s` is a list containing '1'. Otherwise, `s` is a list containing '0'.***
