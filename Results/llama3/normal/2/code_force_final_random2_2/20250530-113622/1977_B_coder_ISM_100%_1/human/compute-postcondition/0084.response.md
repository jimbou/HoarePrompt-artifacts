Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer. `s` is a list containing three strings, the first string is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i` (i.e., the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and 2 raised to the power of `i` is not zero), otherwise '0', the second string is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i`, otherwise '0', and the third string is '1'.**

In this output state, the list `s` now contains three strings instead of two. The first two strings still represent the bit set at the position `i` in the value of `x`, and the third string is always '1', which was appended to the list by the code. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
