Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is either 30 or 31, `stdin` contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, `i` is 29, `x` is an integer, `s` is a list of either 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1', '0' or '-1' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', `s` is a list of either 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1', '0' or '-1' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`, except `s[29]` which is '1', and `flag` is 1. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is not '0', or if `flag` is 0, `s` is a list of either 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1', '0' or '-1' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`. If `flag` is 1, the first 29 elements of `s` are either '1', '0' or '-1' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`, the 30th element is '0', and the 31st element is '1'. If `flag` is 0, `s` remains a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1', '0' or '-1' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`.***
