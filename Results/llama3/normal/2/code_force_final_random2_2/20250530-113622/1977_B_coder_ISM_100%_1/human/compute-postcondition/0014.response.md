Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer. If the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, then `s` is a list containing '1', '1', and '1'. Otherwise, `s` is a list containing either '1', '1', and '0' or '1', '0', and '0'.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by appending '1' to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `s` is still dependent on the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x`, but now it has an additional '1' appended to its previous value.
