Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `length` is 30, `i` is 30, `x` is an integer, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, `flag` is 0, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings where each element at index j is '1' if the bit at position j in the binary representation of x is 1, and '0' otherwise.**

In this output state, the value of `flag` has been updated to 0, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still a positive integer greater than 2, `nalla` is still 2, `length` is still 30, `i` is still 30, `x` is still an integer, and `s` is still a list containing 30 strings representing the binary representation of `x`. The stdin still contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially.
