Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `length` is 30, `i` is less than 29, `x` is an integer, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, `s` is a list containing 30 strings where each element at index j is '1' if the bit at position j in the binary representation of x is 1, '0' otherwise, except at index `i` which is now '0'. If flag is 1 and s[i] was '0', then flag is still 1, otherwise flag is still 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `nalla`, `length`, `x`, and the number of test cases in stdin remain unchanged. The list `s` is updated such that the element at index `i` is now '0', regardless of its previous value. The value of `flag` remains the same, unless it was 1 and the element at index `i` in `s` was already '0', in which case it is still 1.
