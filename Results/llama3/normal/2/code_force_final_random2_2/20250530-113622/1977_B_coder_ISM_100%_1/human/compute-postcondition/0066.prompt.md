Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is either 30 or 31, `stdin` contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, `i` is 29, `x` is an integer, `s` is a list of either 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1', '0' or '-1' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', `s` is a list of either 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1', '0' or '-1' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`, except `s[29]` which is '1', and `flag` is 1. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is not '0', or if `flag` is 0, `s` is a list of either 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1', '0' or '-1' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`. If `flag` is 1, the first 29 elements of `s` are either '1', '0' or '-1' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`, the 30th element is '0', and the 31st element is '1'. If `flag` is 0, `s` remains a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1', '0' or '-1' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is either 30 or 31 and must be greater than 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer, `s` is a list of either 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1', '0' or '-1' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`. If `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1', then `s[i]` is '0' and `s[i - 1]` is '-1'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', `s` is a list of either 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1', '0' or '-1' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`, except `s[29]` which is '1', and `flag` is 1. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is not '0', or if `flag` is 0, `s` is a list of either 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1', '0' or '-1' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`. If `flag` is 1, the first 29 elements of `s` are either '1', '0' or '-1' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`, the 30th element is '0', and the 31st element is '1'. If `flag` is 0, `s` remains a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1', '0' or '-1' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is either 30 or 31 and must be greater than 2, `stdin` contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer, `s` is a list of either 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1', '0' or '-1' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`. If `s[2]` is '-1' and `s[1]` is '1', then `s[2]` is '0' and `s[1]` is '-1'. If `flag` is 1, the first 29 elements of `s` are either '1', '0' or '-1' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`, the 30th element is '0', and the 31st element is '1'. If `flag` is 0, `s` remains a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1', '0' or '-1' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is either 30 or 31 and must be greater than 3, `stdin` contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, `i` is 3, `x` is an integer, `s` is a list of either 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1', '0' or '-1' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`. If `s[3]` is '-1' and `s[2]` is '1', then `s[3]` is '0' and `s[2]` is '-1'. If `flag` is 1, the first 29 elements of `s` are either '1', '0' or '-1' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`, the 30th element is '0', and the 31st element is '1'. If `flag` is 0, `s` remains a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1', '0' or '-1' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
