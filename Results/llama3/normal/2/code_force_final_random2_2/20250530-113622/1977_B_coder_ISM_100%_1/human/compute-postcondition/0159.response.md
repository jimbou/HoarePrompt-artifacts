Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, length is 30, i is 30, x is an integer, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, flag is either 0 or 1, and s is a list containing 30 strings where each element at index j is '1' if the bit at position j in the binary representation of x is 1, and '0' otherwise.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all 30 iterations, the output state will have the same values for all variables except `i` and `s`. The variable `i` will be equal to 30, and the list `s` will contain 30 strings, each representing a bit in the binary representation of `x`. If the bit at position `j` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, the element at index `j` in `s` will be '1', and if the bit is 0, the element will be '0'.
