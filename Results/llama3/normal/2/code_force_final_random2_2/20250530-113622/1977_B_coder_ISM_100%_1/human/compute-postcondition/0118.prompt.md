Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, `i` is 29, `x` is an integer. `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each string is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i` (i.e., the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and 2 raised to the power of `i` is not zero), otherwise '0'. `flag` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, length is 30, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, i is 0, x is an integer, s is a list containing 30 strings. If flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i] is equal to s[i + 1], then s[i] is '-1', s[i+1] is '1' and flag is 1. Otherwise, s[i] is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position i, otherwise '0'. If flag is 1, then s[i] is '0' and s[j] is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position j (for j not equal to i), otherwise '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, length is 30, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, i is 1, x is an integer, s is a list containing 29 or 30 strings. If flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i] is equal to s[i + 1], then s[i] is '-1', s[i+1] is '1' and flag is 1. Otherwise, if flag is 0, then s[i] is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position i, otherwise '0'. If flag is 1, then s is a list containing 29 strings where s[i] is '0' and the rest of the strings are either '1' or '0' depending on the value of x and the initial value of flag. If flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', then s[i] is '1' and flag is 0. If flag is 1 and s[i] is not '0', then s[i] is '0' and s[j] is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position j (for j not equal to i), otherwise '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, length is 30, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, i is 2, x is an integer, s is a list containing 29 strings. If flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i] is equal to s[i + 1], then s[i] is '-1', s[i+1] is '1' and flag is 1. Otherwise, if flag is 0, then s[i] is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position i, otherwise '0'. If flag is 1, then s is a list containing 29 strings where s[i] is '0' and the rest of the strings are either '1' or '0' depending on the value of x and the initial value of flag. If flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', then s[i] is '1' and flag is 0. If flag is 1 and s[i] is not '0', then s[i] is '0' and s[j] is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position j (for j not equal to i), otherwise '0'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
