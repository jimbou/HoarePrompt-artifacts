Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, length is 30, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, i is 0, x is an integer, s is a list containing 30 strings where s[i] is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position i, otherwise '0'. If flag is 1, then s[i] is '0' and s[j] is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position j (for j not equal to i), otherwise '0'. Otherwise, flag is not 1.***
