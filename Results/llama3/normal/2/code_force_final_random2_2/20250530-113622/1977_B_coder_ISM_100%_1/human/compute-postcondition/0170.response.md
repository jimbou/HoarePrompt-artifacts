Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `length` is 30, `i` is less than 29, `x` is an integer, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, `flag` is 0, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings where each element at index j is '1' if the bit at position j in the binary representation of x is 1, and '0' otherwise. Either `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'.***
