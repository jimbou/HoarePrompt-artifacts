Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, `i` is less than 30 and greater than or equal to 1, `x` is an integer, `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1', '0' or '-1' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`, but `s[i]` is now '0', and `flag` is 0 if it was 1 and `s[i]` was '0' before, otherwise `flag` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s[i]` has been changed to '0', and if `flag` was 1 and `s[i]` was '0' before, then `flag` is now 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
