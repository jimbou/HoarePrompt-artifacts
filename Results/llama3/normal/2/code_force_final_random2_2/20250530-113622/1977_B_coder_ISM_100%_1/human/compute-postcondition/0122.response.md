Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, length is 30, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, i is 29, x is an integer, s is a list containing 29 strings. The current value of flag is 1. If s[i] is '0', then s[i] is '1' and flag is 0. If s[i] is not '0', then s[i] is '0' and s[j] is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position j (for j not equal to i), otherwise '0'. Additionally, s[29] is not '0'.**
