Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `length` is 30, `i` is 29, `x` is an integer, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, `flag` is 1, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings where each element at index `j` is '1' if the bit at position `j` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, '0' otherwise, except for the last element which is '1'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still a positive integer greater than 2, `nalla` is still 2, `length` is still 30, `i` is still 29, `x` is still an integer, stdin still contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, `flag` is still 1, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings where each element at index `j` is '1' if the bit at position `j` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, '0' otherwise, except for the last element which is now '1'.
