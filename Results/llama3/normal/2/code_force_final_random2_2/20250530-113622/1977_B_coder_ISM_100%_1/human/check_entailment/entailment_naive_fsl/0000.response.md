Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all the edge cases. The program first converts the input number to binary and stores it in a list. Then it iterates over the list from left to right, checking for consecutive 1's. If it finds consecutive 1's, it replaces the first 1 with -1 and the second 1 with 0. If the last bit is 1 and the flag is 1, it appends a 1 to the list. Finally, it prints the length of the list and the list itself.

The program handles all the edge cases, including when the input number is a power of 2, when the input number has consecutive 1's, and when the input number has a 1 in the most significant bit. The program also handles the case when the input number is 1, in which case it simply prints [1].

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work correctly, so I conclude that the program is correct.
