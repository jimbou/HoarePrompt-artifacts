Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer. `s` is a list containing two strings, the first string is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i` (i.e., the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and 2 raised to the power of `i` is not zero), otherwise '0', and the second string is '0'.**

In this output state, the list `s` now contains two strings. The first string is determined by the value of `x` and the position `i`, and the second string is always '0' as appended by the code. The other variables remain unchanged.
