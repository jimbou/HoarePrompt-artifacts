Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, `i` is less than 29, `x` is an integer, `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`. If `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` is '0', then `s[i]` is updated to '1'. Otherwise, no changes are made. `flag` is 0.***
