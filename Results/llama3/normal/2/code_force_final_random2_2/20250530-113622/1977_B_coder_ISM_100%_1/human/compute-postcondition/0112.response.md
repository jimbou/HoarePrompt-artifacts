Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, length is 30, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, i is 2, x is an integer, s is a list containing 29 or 30 strings. If flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i] is equal to s[i + 1], then s[i] is '-1', s[i+1] is '1' and flag is 1. Otherwise, if flag is 0, then s[i] is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position i, otherwise '0'. If flag is 1, then s is a list containing 29 strings where s[i] is '0' and the rest of the strings are either '1' or '0' depending on the value of x and the initial value of flag. If flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', then s[i] is '1' and flag is 0. If flag is 1 and s[i] is not '0', then s[i] is '0' and s[j] is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position j (for j not equal to i), otherwise '0'.***
