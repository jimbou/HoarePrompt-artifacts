Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, length is 30, i is 30, x is an integer, s is an empty list, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, flag is either 0 or 1, and s is either a list containing 29 strings where the last element is '1' or a list containing 30 strings.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(30):
    if x & pow(2, i):
        s.append('1')
    else:
        s.append('0')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, length is 30, i is less than 30, x is an integer, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, flag is either 0 or 1. If the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 1, then s is a list containing 30 strings where the last element is '1'. If the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 0, then s is either a list containing 29 strings where the last element is '0' or a list containing 30 strings where the last element is '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, length is 30, i is less than 31, x is an integer, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, flag is either 0 or 1. If the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 1, then s is a list containing 30 strings where the last element is '1'. If the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 0, then s is a list containing 30 strings where the last element is '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `length` is 30, `i` is less than 32, `x` is an integer, `stdin` contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, `flag` is either 0 or 1. If the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, then `s` is a list containing 31 strings where the last element is '1'. If the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 0, then `s` is a list containing 31 strings where the last element is '0'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
