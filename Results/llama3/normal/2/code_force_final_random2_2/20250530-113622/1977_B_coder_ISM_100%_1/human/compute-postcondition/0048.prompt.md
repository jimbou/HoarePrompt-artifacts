Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, `i` is 29, `x` is an integer, `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`, `flag` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, `i` is less than 29, `x` is an integer, `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]` and `s[i]` is '1', then `s[i]` is updated to '-1' and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1, then `s[i]` is '0'. Otherwise, `flag` is 0 and either `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, `i` is less than 30, `x` is an integer, `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1', '0' or '-1' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is '1' and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]`, then `s[i]` is '-1' and `flag` is 1. If `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` is '0', then `s[i]` is '1' and `flag` is 0. Otherwise, `flag` and `s[i]` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 0, nalla is 0, length is 30, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, i is less than 30 and greater than or equal to 1, x is an integer, s is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1', '0' or '-1' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of x. If flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i] is equal to s[i + 1], then s[i] is '-1' and flag is 1. If flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', then s[i] is '1' and flag is 0. If flag is 1 and s[i] is not '0', then s[i] is '0' and flag is 0. If none of the above conditions are met, then flag and s[i] remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
