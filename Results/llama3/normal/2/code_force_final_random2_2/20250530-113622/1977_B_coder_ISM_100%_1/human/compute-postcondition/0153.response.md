Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, length is 30, i is less than 31, x is an integer, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, flag is either 0 or 1. If the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 1, then s is a list containing 30 strings where the last element is '1'. If the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 0, then s is a list containing 30 strings where the last element is '0'.***
