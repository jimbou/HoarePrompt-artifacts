Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 â‰¤ x < 2^30).**

In natural language, the output state means that the variable `t` has been assigned a positive integer value from the input, and the stdin now contains one less test case than before. The remaining test cases still contain a single positive integer x, where x is between 1 and 2^30 (exclusive).
