Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, length is either 30 or 31 and must be greater than 2, i is 3, x is an integer, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, flag is either 0 or 1, and s is a list containing either 30 or 31 strings where each element at index j is '1' if the bit at position j in the binary representation of x is 1, '0' otherwise, except for the last element which is either '-1', '0' or '1' respectively. If flag is 1 and the last element of s is '0', then flag is 1 and the last element of s is '1'. If flag is 1 and the last element of s is not '0', then length is 31 and the last two elements of s are '0' and '1' respectively. Otherwise, length is 30 and the last element of s is '-1'. If the current value of s[i] is '-1' and the current value of s[i - 1] is '1', then the current value of s[i] is '0' and the current value of s[i - 1] is '-1'. If the condition (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1') is true, then s[2] is '0' and s[1] is '-1'. Otherwise, no changes are made to s. If the condition (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1') is true, then s[3] is '0' and s[2] is '-1'.**
