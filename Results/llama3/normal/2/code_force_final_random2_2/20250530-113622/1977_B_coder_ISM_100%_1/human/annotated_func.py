If flag is 1 and the last element of s is '0', then flag is 1 and the last element of s is '1'. If flag is 1 and the last element of s is not '0', then length is 31 and the last two elements of s are '0' and '1' respectively. Otherwise, length is 30 and the last element of s is '-1'. For all indices i where the condition (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1') is true, s[i] is '0' and s[i - 1] is '-1', and the list s and the length which is either 30 or 31 are being printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case is a single positive integer x. For each test case, it converts the integer to its binary representation, modifies the binary string by applying a set of rules, and then prints the length of the modified binary string and the string itself. The rules involve flipping bits, inserting a new bit, and swapping bits under certain conditions. The function processes all test cases and prints the modified binary strings and their lengths.
