Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `length` is either 30 or 31, `i` is 29, `x` is an integer, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, `flag` is either 0 or 1, and `s` is a list containing either 30 or 31 strings where each element at index `j` is '1' if the bit at position `j` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, '0' otherwise, except for the last element which is either '-1', '0' or '1' respectively. If `flag` is 1, then `length` is 31 and the last two elements of `s` are '0' and '1' respectively. Otherwise, `length` is 30 and the last element of `s` is '-1'.***
