Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 â‰¤ x < 2^30).
Code of the loop:
for nalla in range(t):
    x = int(input())
    s = []
    length = 30
    for i in range(30):
        if x & pow(2, i):
            s.append('1')
        else:
            s.append('0')
    flag = 0
    for i in range(0, 29):
        if flag and s[i] == '0':
            s[i] = '1'
            flag = 0
        if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
            s[i] = '-1'
            flag = 1
        elif flag == 1:
            s[i] = '0'
        else:
            pass
    if flag and s[29] == '0':
        s[29] = '1'
    elif flag:
        s[29] = '0'
        s.append('1')
        length += 1
    for i in range(1, length):
        if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
            s[i] = '0'
            s[i - 1] = '-1'
    print(length)
    print(*s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is either 30 or 31, `stdin` contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, `i` is `length` - 1, `x` is an integer, `s` is a list of either 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1', '0' or '-1' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`. If `flag` is 1, the first 29 elements of `s` are either '1', '0' or '-1' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`, the 30th element is '0', and the 31st element is '1'. If `flag` is 0, `s` remains a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1', '0' or '-1' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`. For all `j` in the range from 1 to `length` - 1, if `s[j]` is '-1' and `s[j - 1]` is '1', then `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j - 1]` is '-1', and the list `s` which is either 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1', '0' or '-1' depending on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, length is either 30 or 31 and must be greater than 1, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, i is equal to length, x is an integer, s is a list containing either 29 or 30 strings. If flag is 1 and s[29] is '0', then length is 30, s is a list containing 29 strings where the last element is '1', and flag is 0. Otherwise, length is 31, s is a list containing 30 strings. If flag is 1, then s[29] is '0', s[30] is '1', and the values of s[j] for j not equal to i and 29 are either '0' or '1' based on the bits set in x, and flag is 1 if s[i] is '0' and 0 if s[i] is not '0'. If flag is 0, then s is a list containing 29 strings where s[i] is '0' and the rest of the strings are either '1' or '0' depending on the value of x and the initial value of flag. Additionally, either flag is 0 or s[29] is not '0'. If s[i] is '-1' and s[i - 1] is '1', then the current value of s[i] is '0' and the current value of s[i - 1] is '-1'. Otherwise, s[i] and s[i - 1] remain unchanged, and the list s containing either 29 or 30 strings is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, length is either 30 or 31, i is equal to length, x is an integer, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, flag is either 0 or 1, and s is a list containing either 30 or 31 strings where each element at index j is '1' if the bit at position j in the binary representation of x is 1, '0' otherwise, except for the last element which is either '-1', '0' or '1' respectively. If flag is 1 and the last element of s is '0', then flag is 1 and the last element of s is '1'. If flag is 1 and the last element of s is not '0', then length is 31 and the last two elements of s are '0' and '1' respectively. Otherwise, length is 30 and the last element of s is '-1'. For all indices i where the condition (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1') is true, s[i] is '0' and s[i - 1] is '-1', and the list s and the length which is either 30 or 31 are being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
