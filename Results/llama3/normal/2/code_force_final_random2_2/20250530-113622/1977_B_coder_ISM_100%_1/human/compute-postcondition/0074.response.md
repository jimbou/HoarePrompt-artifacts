Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, `i` is 0, `x` is an integer, `s` is an empty list. The current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i` (i.e., the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and 2 raised to the power of `i` is not zero).***
