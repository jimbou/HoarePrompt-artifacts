Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, length is 30, i is less than 29, x is an integer, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, flag is 1, and s is a list containing 30 strings where each element at index j is '1' if the bit at position j in the binary representation of x is 1, '0' otherwise, except for index i which is '-1'.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 2. The value of `nalla` also remains the same, which is 2. The value of `length` is still 30. The value of `i` is still less than 29. The value of `x` remains an integer, but its exact value is not specified. The number of test cases in stdin is at least 1 fewer than initially. The value of `flag` has been updated to 1. The list `s` contains 30 strings, where each element at index `j` is '1' if the bit at position `j` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, and '0' otherwise, except for index `i` which has been updated to '-1'.
