Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, length is 30, i is less than 30, x is an integer, s is either an empty list or a list containing 29 strings where the last element is '1' or a list containing 30 strings, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, flag is either 0 or 1. The current value of x has a bit set at position i (i.e., x & pow(2, i) is true).**
