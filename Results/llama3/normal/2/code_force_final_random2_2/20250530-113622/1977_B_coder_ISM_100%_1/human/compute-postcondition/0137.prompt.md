Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, length is either 30 or 31, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, i is 29, x is an integer, s is a list containing either 29 or 30 strings. If flag is 1 and s[29] is '0', then length is 30, s is a list containing 29 strings where the last element is '1', and flag is 0. Otherwise, length is 31, s is a list containing 30 strings. If flag is 1, then s[29] is '0', s[30] is '1', and the values of s[j] for j not equal to i and 29 are either '0' or '1' based on the bits set in x, and flag is 1 if s[i] is '0' and 0 if s[i] is not '0'. If flag is 0, then s is a list containing 29 strings where s[i] is '0' and the rest of the strings are either '1' or '0' depending on the value of x and the initial value of flag. Additionally, either flag is 0 or s[29] is not '0'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, length is either 30 or 31 and must be greater than 1, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, i is 1, x is an integer, s is a list containing either 29 or 30 strings. If flag is 1 and s[29] is '0', then length is 30, s is a list containing 29 strings where the last element is '1', and flag is 0. Otherwise, length is 31, s is a list containing 30 strings. If flag is 1, then s[29] is '0', s[30] is '1', and the values of s[j] for j not equal to i and 29 are either '0' or '1' based on the bits set in x, and flag is 1 if s[i] is '0' and 0 if s[i] is not '0'. If flag is 0, then s is a list containing 29 strings where s[i] is '0' and the rest of the strings are either '1' or '0' depending on the value of x and the initial value of flag. Additionally, either flag is 0 or s[29] is not '0'. If s[i] is '-1' and s[i - 1] is '1', then the current value of s[i] is '0' and the current value of s[i - 1] is '-1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, length is either 30 or 31 and must be greater than 1, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, i is 2, x is an integer, s is a list containing either 29 or 30 strings. If flag is 1 and s[29] is '0', then length is 30, s is a list containing 29 strings where the last element is '1', and flag is 0. Otherwise, length is 31, s is a list containing 30 strings. If flag is 1, then s[29] is '0', s[30] is '1', and the values of s[j] for j not equal to i and 29 are either '0' or '1' based on the bits set in x, and flag is 1 if s[i] is '0' and 0 if s[i] is not '0'. If flag is 0, then s is a list containing 29 strings where s[i] is '0' and the rest of the strings are either '1' or '0' depending on the value of x and the initial value of flag. Additionally, either flag is 0 or s[29] is not '0'. If s[i] is '-1' and s[i - 1] is '1', then the current value of s[i] is '0' and the current value of s[i - 1] is '-1'. If s[i] is '-1' and s[i - 1] is '1', then s[i] is '0' and s[i - 1] is '-1'. Otherwise, s[i] and s[i - 1] remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, length is either 30 or 31 and must be greater than 3, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, i is 3, x is an integer, s is a list containing either 29 or 30 strings. If flag is 1 and s[29] is '0', then length is 30, s is a list containing 29 strings where the last element is '1', and flag is 0. Otherwise, length is 31, s is a list containing 30 strings. If flag is 1, then s[29] is '0', s[30] is '1', and the values of s[j] for j not equal to i and 29 are either '0' or '1' based on the bits set in x, and flag is 1 if s[i] is '0' and 0 if s[i] is not '0'. If flag is 0, then s is a list containing 29 strings where s[i] is '0' and the rest of the strings are either '1' or '0' depending on the value of x and the initial value of flag. Additionally, either flag is 0 or s[29] is not '0'. If s[i] is '-1' and s[i - 1] is '1', then the current value of s[i] is '0' and the current value of s[i - 1] is '-1'. Otherwise, s[i] and s[i - 1] remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
