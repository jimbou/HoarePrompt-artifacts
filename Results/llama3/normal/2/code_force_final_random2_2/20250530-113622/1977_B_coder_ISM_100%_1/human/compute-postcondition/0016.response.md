Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer. If the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, then `s` is a list containing '1', '1', and either '1' or '0'. If the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 0, then `s` is a list containing '1', and either '0' and '0' or '0' and '1'.***
