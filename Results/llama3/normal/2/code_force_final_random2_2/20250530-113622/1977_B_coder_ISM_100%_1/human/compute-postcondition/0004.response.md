Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an integer, `s` is an empty list, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains at least 1 fewer test case than initially, `i` is 0. The current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i`, meaning the binary representation of `x` has a 1 at the `i-th` position.**
