The code prints the elements of the list `ans`. The list `ans` contains 23 integers. The first three elements are `k` - (1 << `i`), `k` + 1, and `k` + 1 + (1 << `i`). The remaining 20 elements are powers of 2 (1 << `j`) for `j` in range(20) excluding `i`.

Since the exact values of `k` and `i` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in the list `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the 23 elements of the list `ans`.

Output: **k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), and 1 << j for j in range(20) excluding i (where k is greater than 1 << i + 1 and i is the smallest integer such that 1 << i + 1 > k is true)**
