The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 2, so the new value of `i` is 3. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 8, `i` is 3, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers**
