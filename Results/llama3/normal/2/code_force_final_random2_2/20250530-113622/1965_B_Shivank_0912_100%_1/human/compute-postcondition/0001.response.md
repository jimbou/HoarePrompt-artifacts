The only variable in the loop head is `tc` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `tc` is now 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `tc` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0**
