Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), tc is 1, n is an integer, k is greater than or equal to 2^(i-1) and 1 << i + 1, i is the smallest integer such that 1 << i + 1 > k is not true and has been incremented by 1, ans is a list containing 23 integers: k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, stdin contains t-5 lines, each containing two integers, j is 20, and the length of the list ans which is 23 is being printed, and all the elements of the list ans are being printed**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The list `ans` still contains 23 integers, and its length and elements are still being printed. The input in `stdin` remains the same, containing `t-5` lines with two integers each. The values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `k`, and `j` are unchanged.
