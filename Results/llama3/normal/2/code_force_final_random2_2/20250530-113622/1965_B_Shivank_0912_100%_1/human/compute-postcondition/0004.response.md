Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers**

The code increments the value of `i` by 1, so `i` is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-2` lines, but since `i` has been incremented, we can say that `t-3` lines are left in the stdin.
