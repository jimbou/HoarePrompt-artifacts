Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), tc is 2, n is an integer, k is greater than or equal to 16, i is 3 or less, ans is a list containing 23 integers: k - (1 << 1), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << 1), and 1 << j for j in range(20) excluding 1, j is 20, the length of the list ans which is 23 has been printed, and all the elements of the list ans have been printed, stdin contains t-7 lines, each containing two integers, and the length of the list ans which is 23 is being printed, and all the elements of the list ans are being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3 or less. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
