Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 1 << `i` + 1, `i` is the smallest integer such that 1 << `i` + 1 > `k` is true, `ans` is a list containing 23 integers: `k` - (1 << `i`), `k` + 1, `k` + 1 + (1 << `i`), and 1 << `j` for `j` in range(20) excluding `i`, `j` is 20, the length of the list `ans` which is 23 has been printed, and all the elements of the list `ans` have been printed, stdin contains `t`-5 lines, each containing two integers.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `ans` will contain 23 integers: the initial three integers `k` - (1 << `i`), `k` + 1, `k` + 1 + (1 << `i`), and 20 additional integers of the form 1 << `j` for `j` in range(20) excluding `i`. The value of `j` will be 20, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The length of the list `ans` and all its elements will have been printed. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
