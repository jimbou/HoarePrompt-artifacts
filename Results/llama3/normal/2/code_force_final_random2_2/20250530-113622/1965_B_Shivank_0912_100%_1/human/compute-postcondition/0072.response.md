Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2^i, `i` is the largest integer such that 2^i is less than or equal to `k`. If `j` is not equal to `i`, then `ans` is a list containing 4 integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j`. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing 3 integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`. The length of the list `ans` has been printed, and all the elements of the list `ans` have been printed. Stdin contains `t-7` lines, each containing two integers, and the length of the list `ans` is being printed, and all the elements of the list `ans` are being printed.**
