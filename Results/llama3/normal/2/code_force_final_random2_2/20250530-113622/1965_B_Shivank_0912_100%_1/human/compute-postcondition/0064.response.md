Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2^i, `i` is the largest integer such that 2^i is less than or equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing 4 integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j`, `j` is 0, the length of the list `ans` which is 4 has been printed, and all the elements of the list `ans` have been printed, stdin contains `t-7` lines, each containing two integers, and the length of the list `ans` which is 4 is being printed, and all the elements of the list `ans` are being printed. The current value of `j` is not equal to the current value of `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remains the same. The list `ans` now contains four integers: the original three integers and a new integer which is `1 << j`. The value of `j` is still 0. The length of the list `ans` and all its elements are being printed. The stdin still contains `t-7` lines, each containing two integers.
