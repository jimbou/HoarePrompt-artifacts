To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `j` and the range `20`. Since the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range `20`, we need to set `j` to the starting value of the range, which is `0`. The range `20` is already defined, so we don't need to adjust it.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2^(i-1), `i` is the smallest integer such that 1 << i + 1 > k, `ans` is a list containing three integers: k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers, `j` is 0**
