Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2^(i-1), `i` is the smallest integer such that 1 << i + 1 > k, `ans` is a list containing three integers: k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains between 1 and 1000, `tc` is still 0, `n` is still an integer, `k` is still greater than or equal to 2 raised to the power of `i-1`, and `i` is still the smallest integer such that 2 raised to the power of `i+1` is greater than `k`. A new variable `ans` is introduced, which is a list containing three integers: `k` minus 2 raised to the power of `i`, `k` plus 1, and `k` plus 1 plus 2 raised to the power of `i`. The standard input still contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers.
