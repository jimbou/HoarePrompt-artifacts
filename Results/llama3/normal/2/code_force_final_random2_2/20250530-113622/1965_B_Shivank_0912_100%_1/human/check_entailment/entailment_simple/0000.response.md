Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding a sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25, such that there is no subsequence with a sum of k, and for all 1 ≤ v ≤ n where v ≠ k, there is a subsequence with a sum of v.

The program starts by reading the number of test cases t and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers n and k.

The program then calculates the largest integer i such that 2^i is less than or equal to k. This is done using a while loop that increments i until 2^(i+1) is greater than k.

Next, the program constructs the sequence ans by appending the following elements:

*   k - (1 << i)
*   k + 1
*   k + 1 + (1 << i)
*   1 << j for all j in range(20) where j is not equal to i

The program then prints the length of the sequence ans, which is 21, and all the elements of the sequence ans.

The program's approach is based on the idea of using powers of 2 to construct the sequence. By including all powers of 2 except for 2^i, the program ensures that there is no subsequence with a sum of k. The elements k - (1 << i), k + 1, and k + 1 + (1 << i) are included to ensure that there are subsequences with sums of all values except k.

The program's output matches the expected output for the given example inputs, and its approach is correct based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
