The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and its previous value was 1, so the new value of `i` is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers.
