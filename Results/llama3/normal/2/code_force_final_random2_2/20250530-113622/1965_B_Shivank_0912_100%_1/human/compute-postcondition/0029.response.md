The only variable in the loop head is variable i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables i and k. If 1 << i + 1 is less than or equal to k, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, i is the smallest integer such that 1 << i + 1 > k, k is greater than or equal to 2^(i-1). For the loop to execute the first time, the smallest integer i such that 1 << i + 1 > k needs to be adjusted to the smallest integer i such that 1 << i + 1 > k is not true, and k needs to be adjusted to k is greater than or equal to 2^(i-1) and 1 << i + 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), tc is 1, n is an integer, k is greater than or equal to 2^(i-1) and 1 << i + 1, i is the smallest integer such that 1 << i + 1 > k is not true, ans is a list containing 23 integers: k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, stdin contains t-5 lines, each containing two integers, j is 20, and the length of the list ans which is 23 is being printed, and all the elements of the list ans are being printed**
