Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2^(i-1), `i` is the smallest integer such that 1 << i + 1 > k, `ans` is a list containing four integers: k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers, `j` is not equal to `i`.**

The code appends the value of 1 shifted left by `j` bits to the `ans` list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The `ans` list now contains four integers: the original three integers and the new integer 1 << j. The stdin still contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers. The relationship between `i` and `j` remains the same, with `j` not equal to `i`.
