Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is `t-1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2^i, `i` is the largest integer such that 2^i is less than or equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing 21 integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j` for all `j` in range(20) where `j` is not equal to `i`, `j` is 19, the length of the list `ans` which is 21 has been printed, and all the elements of the list `ans` have been printed, stdin contains 0 lines, and the length of the list `ans` which is 21 is printed, and all the elements of the list `ans` are printed: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j` for all `j` in range(20) where `j` is not equal to `i`.**

This output state describes the final state of the program after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop has processed all `t-1` lines from stdin, and the last set of values for `n`, `k`, `i`, and `ans` have been computed and printed. The loop has finished executing, and the program has terminated.
