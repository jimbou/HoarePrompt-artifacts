Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2^(i-1), `i` is the smallest integer such that 1 << i + 1 > k, `ans` is a list containing three integers: k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(20):
    if j != i:
        ans.append(1 << j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2^(i-1), `i` is the smallest integer such that 1 << i + 1 > k, `ans` is a list containing four integers: k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j if j is not equal to i, otherwise `ans` is a list containing three integers: k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2^(i-1), `i` is the smallest integer such that 1 << i + 1 > k, `ans` is a list containing five integers: k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j if j is not equal to i, otherwise `ans` is a list containing four integers: k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers, `j` is the smallest integer such that 1 << j + 1 > k + 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2^(i-1), `i` is the smallest integer such that 1 << i + 1 > k, `ans` is a list containing six integers: k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j if j is not equal to i, otherwise `ans` is a list containing five integers: k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j, 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers, `j` is 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
