Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2^i, `i` is the largest integer such that 2^i is less than or equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing 4 integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j`, `j` is 2, the length of the list `ans` has been printed, and all the elements of the list `ans` have been printed, stdin contains `t-7` lines, each containing two integers, and the length of the list `ans` is being printed, and all the elements of the list `ans` are being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains between 2 and 1000, `tc` is still 2, `n` is still an integer, `k` is still greater than or equal to 2 raised to the power of `i`, `i` is still the largest integer such that 2 raised to the power of `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `ans` is now a list containing four integers: `k` minus 2 raised to the power of `i`, `k` plus 1, `k` plus 1 plus 2 raised to the power of `i`, and 2 raised to the power of `j`. The value of `j` is still 2. The length of the list `ans` and all its elements have been printed. The stdin still contains `t-7` lines, each containing two integers. The length of the list `ans` and all its elements are being printed.
