The code prints the elements of the list `ans`. The list `ans` contains 21 integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j` for all `j` in range(20) where `j` is not equal to `i`. Here, `k` is greater than or equal to 2^i, `i` is the largest integer such that 2^i is less than or equal to `k`, and `j` is 19.

Since the exact values of `k` and `i` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in the list `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the 21 elements of the list `ans` as described above.

Output: **k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), and 1 << j for all j in range(20) where j is not equal to i, and j is 19 (where k is greater than or equal to 2^i, i is the largest integer such that 2^i is less than or equal to k)**
