To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `1 << i + 1 <= k`. This condition involves the variables `i` and `k`.

Given that `i` is 0, the condition simplifies to `1 << 0 + 1 <= k`, which further simplifies to `2 <= k`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.

The state of `t`, `tc`, `n`, and the contents of `stdin` do not affect the condition of the `while` loop directly, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers**
