The variables in the loop head are i and k, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables i and k. If 1 << i + 1 is less than or equal to k, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 1 and k is greater than 1 << i + 1. Since 1 << i + 1 is 4, k being greater than 4 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to k being greater than or equal to 8. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), tc is 2, n is an integer, k is greater than or equal to 8, i is 1, ans is a list containing 23 integers: k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), and 1 << j for j in range(20) excluding i, j is 20, the length of the list ans which is 23 has been printed, and all the elements of the list ans have been printed, stdin contains t-7 lines, each containing two integers, and the length of the list ans which is 23 is being printed, and all the elements of the list ans are being printed**
