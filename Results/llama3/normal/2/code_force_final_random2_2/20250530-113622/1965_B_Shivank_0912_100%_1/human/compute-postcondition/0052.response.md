To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `tc`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `tc` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `tc` is 1 and `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `tc` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 1 << `i` + 1, `i` is the smallest integer such that 1 << `i` + 1 > `k` is true, `ans` is a list containing 23 integers: `k` - (1 << `i`), `k` + 1, `k` + 1 + (1 << `i`), and 1 << `j` for `j` in range(20) excluding `i`, `j` is 20, the length of the list `ans` which is 23 has been printed, and all the elements of the list `ans` have been printed, stdin contains `t`-6 lines, each containing two integers, and the length of the list `ans` which is 23 is being printed, and all the elements of the list `ans` are being printed**
