The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 20, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the smallest integer such that 1 << j + 1 > k, so for the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2^(i-1), `i` is the smallest integer such that 1 << i + 1 > k, `ans` is a list containing four integers: k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j if j is not equal to i, otherwise `ans` is a list containing three integers: k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers, `j` is the smallest integer such that 1 << j + 1 > k + 1**
