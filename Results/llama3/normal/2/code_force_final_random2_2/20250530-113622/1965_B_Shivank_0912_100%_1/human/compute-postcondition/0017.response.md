Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2^(i-1), `i` is the smallest integer such that 1 << i + 1 > k, `ans` is a list containing five integers: k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j if j is not equal to i, otherwise `ans` is a list containing four integers: k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers, `j` is the smallest integer such that 1 << j + 1 > k + 1**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by appending the value of `1 << j` to the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `j` is still the smallest integer such that `1 << j + 1 > k + 1`, and the value of `i` is still the smallest integer such that `1 << i + 1 > k`. The stdin still contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers.
