Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2^(i-1), `i` is the smallest integer such that 1 << i + 1 > k, `ans` is a list containing six integers: k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j if j is not equal to i, otherwise `ans` is a list containing five integers: k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j, 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers, `j` is 1**

The code appends the value 1 << j to the list `ans`. Since j is 1, the value appended is 1 << 1 = 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers.
