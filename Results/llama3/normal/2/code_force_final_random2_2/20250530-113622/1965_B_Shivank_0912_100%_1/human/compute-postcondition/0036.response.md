Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 1 << `i` + 1, `i` is the smallest integer such that 1 << `i` + 1 > `k` is true, `ans` is a list containing three integers: `k` - (1 << `i`), `k` + 1, `k` + 1 + (1 << `i`), `j` is 20, and the length of the list `ans` which is 3 is being printed, and all the elements of the list `ans` are being printed, stdin contains `t`-5 lines, each containing two integers.**

In this output state, the list `ans` has been updated to contain only three integers: `k` - (1 << `i`), `k` + 1, and `k` + 1 + (1 << `i`). The other variables remain unchanged. The length of the list `ans` is now 3, and its elements are being printed. The stdin still contains `t`-5 lines, each containing two integers.
