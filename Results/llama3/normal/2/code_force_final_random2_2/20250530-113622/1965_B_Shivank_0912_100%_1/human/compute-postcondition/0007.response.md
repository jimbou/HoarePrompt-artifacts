The variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `1 << i + 1` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 4. `k` being greater than or equal to 4 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than or equal to 8. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 8, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers**
