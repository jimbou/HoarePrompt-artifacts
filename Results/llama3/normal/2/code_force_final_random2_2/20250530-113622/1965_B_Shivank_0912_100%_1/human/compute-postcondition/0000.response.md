The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`. Since `t` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, the stdin now contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`. The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`.**
