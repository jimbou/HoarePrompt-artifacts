Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2^i, `i` is the smallest integer such that 1 << i + 1 > k, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` remains 0, `n` remains an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2^i, `i` is the smallest integer such that 1 << i + 1 > k, and stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers.
