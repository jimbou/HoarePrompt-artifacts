Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output. It accepts an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n). The function then generates a list of 21 integers based on the values of n and k, and prints the length of the list and its elements. The list contains the values k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), and 1 << j for all j in range(20) where j is not equal to i. The function repeats this process t times, and finally, it prints the length of the list and its elements for each test case.**
