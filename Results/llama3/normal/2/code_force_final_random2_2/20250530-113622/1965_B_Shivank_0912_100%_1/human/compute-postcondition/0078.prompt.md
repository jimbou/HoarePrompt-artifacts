Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`.
Code of the loop:
for tc in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    i = 0
    while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
        i = i + 1
    ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
    for j in range(20):
        if j != i:
            ans.append(1 << j)
    print(len(ans))
    print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2^(i-1), `i` is the smallest integer such that 1 << i + 1 > k, `ans` is a list containing 23 integers: k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers, `j` is 20, and the length of the list `ans` which is 23 is being printed, and all the elements of the list `ans` are being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 1 << `i` + 1, `i` is the smallest integer such that 1 << `i` + 1 > `k` is true, `ans` is a list containing 23 integers: `k` - (1 << `i`), `k` + 1, `k` + 1 + (1 << `i`), and 1 << `j` for `j` in range(20) excluding `i`, `j` is 20, the length of the list `ans` which is 23 has been printed, and all the elements of the list `ans` have been printed, stdin contains `t`-5 lines, each containing two integers, and the length of the list `ans` which is 23 is being printed, and all the elements of the list `ans` are being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2^i, `i` is the largest integer such that 2^i is less than or equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing 21 integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j` for all `j` in range(20) where `j` is not equal to `i`, `j` is 19, the length of the list `ans` which is 21 has been printed, and all the elements of the list `ans` have been printed, stdin contains `t-7` lines, each containing two integers, and the length of the list `ans` which is 21 is being printed, and all the elements of the list `ans` are being printed, and the length of the list `ans` which is 21 is printed, and all the elements of the list `ans` are printed: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j` for all `j` in range(20) where `j` is not equal to `i`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
