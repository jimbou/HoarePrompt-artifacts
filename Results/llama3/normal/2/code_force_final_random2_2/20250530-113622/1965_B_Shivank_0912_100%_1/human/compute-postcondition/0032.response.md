Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2^(i-1) and 1 << i + 1, `i` is the smallest integer such that 1 << i + 1 > k is not true and has been incremented by 1 and now is the smallest integer such that 1 << i + 1 > k is true, `ans` is a list containing 23 integers: k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, stdin contains t-5 lines, each containing two integers, `j` is 20, and the length of the list `ans` which is 23 is being printed, and all the elements of the list `ans` are being printed, 1 << i + 1 must be less than or equal to k**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and now it is the smallest integer such that 1 << i + 1 > k is true. All other variables remain unchanged.
