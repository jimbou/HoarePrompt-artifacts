Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), tc is 1, n is an integer, k is greater than 1 << i + 1, i is the smallest integer such that 1 << i + 1 > k is true, ans is a list containing 23 integers: k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, stdin contains t-5 lines, each containing two integers, j is 20, and the length of the list ans which is 23 is being printed, and all the elements of the list ans are being printed**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times. The loop will continue to execute until the condition 1 << i + 1 > k is true, at which point it will stop. Since k is greater than 1 << i + 1, the loop will execute until i is the smallest integer such that 1 << i + 1 > k is true. At this point, the loop will stop, and the output state will be the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times.
