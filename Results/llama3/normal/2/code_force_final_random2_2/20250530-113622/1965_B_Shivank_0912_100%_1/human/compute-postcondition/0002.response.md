Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), tc is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, i is 0, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers**.

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `tc` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The values of `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the first line of input from stdin, which contains two integers. The value of `i` is assigned 0. Stdin now contains `t-2` lines, each containing two integers, as one line has been read and processed.
