The only variable in the loop head is variable  tc and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc` and `t`. If `tc` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tc` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `tc` is increased by 1 so `tc` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2^(i-1), `i` is the smallest integer such that 1 << i + 1 > k, `ans` is a list containing 23 integers: k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing two integers, `j` is 20, and the length of the list `ans` which is 23 is being printed, and all the elements of the list `ans` are being printed**
