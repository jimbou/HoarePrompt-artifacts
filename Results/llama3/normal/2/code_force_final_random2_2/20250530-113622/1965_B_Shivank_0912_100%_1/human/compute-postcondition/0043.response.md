Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 1 << `i` + 1, `i` is the smallest integer such that 1 << `i` + 1 > `k` is true, `ans` is a list containing three integers: `k` - (1 << `i`), `k` + 1, `k` + 1 + (1 << `i`), if `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` is a list containing four integers: `k` - (1 << `i`), `k` + 1, `k` + 1 + (1 << `i`), and 1 << `j`, `j` is 1, the length of the list `ans` has been printed, and all the elements of the list `ans` have been printed, stdin contains `t`-5 lines, each containing two integers.***
