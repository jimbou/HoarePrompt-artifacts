Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2^i, `i` is the largest integer such that 2^i is less than or equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing 3 integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, `j` is 20, the length of the list `ans` which is 3 has been printed, and all the elements of the list `ans` have been printed, stdin contains `t-7` lines, each containing two integers, and the length of the list `ans` which is 3 is being printed, and all the elements of the list `ans` are being printed.**

In this output state, the list `ans` has been reinitialized to contain only three integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`. The other variables remain unchanged. The length of the list `ans` and its elements are being printed, and the stdin still contains `t-7` lines, each with two integers.
