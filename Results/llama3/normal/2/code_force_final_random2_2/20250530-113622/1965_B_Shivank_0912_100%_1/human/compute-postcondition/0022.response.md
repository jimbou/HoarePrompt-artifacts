Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2^(i-1), `i` is the smallest integer such that 1 << i + 1 > k, `ans` is a list containing 23 integers: k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers, `j` is 20**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except that the `ans` list now contains 23 integers. The first three integers in the list are the same as in the initial state: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`. The remaining 20 integers in the list are the powers of 2 from 1 to 262144, which are the values of `1 << j` for `j` ranging from 0 to 19. The value of `j` is now 20, indicating that the loop has executed 20 times.
