Functionality: This function calculates and returns the maximum profit that can be achieved by finding the optimal value of 'mid' within the range of 0 to the minimum of 'n' and 'b', where 'n', 'a', and 'b' are positive integers. The function iteratively adjusts the range of 'mid' based on the comparison of profits at the current 'mid' and the next value, and keeps track of the maximum profit found. The function ultimately returns the maximum profit that can be obtained.
