Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, low is equal to high, mid is equal to low and high, profit_mid is equal to func_1(mid, n, a, b), profit_next is equal to func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b), max_profit is the maximum of the original max_profit and profit_mid.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is such that the values of low and high are equal, and mid is also equal to low and high. The value of profit_mid is the result of func_1(mid, n, a, b), and the value of profit_next is the result of func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b). The value of max_profit is the maximum of its original value and profit_mid. The values of n, a, and b remain unchanged.
