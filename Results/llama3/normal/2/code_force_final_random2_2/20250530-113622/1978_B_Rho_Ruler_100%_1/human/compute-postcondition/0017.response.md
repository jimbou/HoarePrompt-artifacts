Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer. The values of low and high are updated based on the comparison of profit_next and profit_mid. If profit_next is greater than profit_mid, low is updated to mid + 1. Otherwise, high is updated to mid - 1. In both cases, mid is updated to the average of low and high, and max_profit is updated to the maximum of its original value and profit_mid.***
