Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, low is a positive integer and less than or equal to high, high is a positive integer, mid is a positive integer equal to (low + high) // 2, profit_mid is a value equal to func_1(mid, n, a, b), profit_next is a value equal to func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b), max_profit is a value equal to the maximum of its original value and profit_mid. If profit_next is greater than profit_mid, then low is updated to mid + 1. Otherwise, high is updated to mid - 1.***
