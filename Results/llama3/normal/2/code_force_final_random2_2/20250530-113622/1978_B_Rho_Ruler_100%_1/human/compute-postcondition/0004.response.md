Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `low` is the average of the original `low` and `high` plus 1, `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`, `mid` is the average of the original `low` and `high`, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, `max_profit` is the maximum of the original `max_profit` and `profit_mid`, and the current value of `profit_next` is greater than the current value of `profit_mid`.**

In this output state, the value of `low` has been updated to be the average of the original `low` and `high` plus 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `profit_next` and `profit_mid` is still maintained, and the value of `max_profit` is still the maximum of the original `max_profit` and `profit_mid`.
