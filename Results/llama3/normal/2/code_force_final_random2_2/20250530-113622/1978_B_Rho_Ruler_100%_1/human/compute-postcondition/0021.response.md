Functionality: This function determines the maximum profit that can be achieved by finding the optimal value of 'mid' within the range of 0 to the minimum of 'n' and 'b', where 'n', 'a', and 'b' are positive integers. It iteratively calculates the profit at the current 'mid' value and the next value, updating the maximum profit if a higher value is found. The function returns the maximum profit found during this process.
