Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, low is 0, high is the minimum of n and b, mid is the average of low and high, profit_mid is the result of func_1(mid, n, a, b), profit_next is the result of func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b), max_profit is the maximum of the original max_profit and profit_mid.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The variable `mid` is assigned the average of `low` and `high`, which is `(0 + min(n, b)) // 2`. The variables `profit_mid` and `profit_next` are assigned the results of calling the function `func_1` with different inputs. Finally, `max_profit` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and `profit_mid`.
