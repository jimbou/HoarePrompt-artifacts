Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `low` is a positive integer and less than or equal to `high`, `high` is a positive integer equal to `mid - 1`, `mid` is a positive integer equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `profit_mid` is a value equal to `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is a value equal to `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, `max_profit` is a value equal to the maximum of its original value and `profit_mid`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, `profit_next`, and `max_profit` remain unchanged. The value of `high` is updated to be `mid - 1`, which is still a positive integer. The relationship between `low` and `high` is maintained, with `low` being less than or equal to `high`.
