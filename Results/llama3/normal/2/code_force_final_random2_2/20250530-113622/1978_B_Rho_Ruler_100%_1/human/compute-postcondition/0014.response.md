Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, low is a positive integer and less than mid + 1, high is a positive integer and greater than mid, mid is a positive integer equal to (low + high) // 2, profit_mid is a value equal to func_1(mid, n, a, b), profit_next is a value equal to func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b), max_profit is a value equal to the maximum of its original value and profit_mid.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, `profit_next`, and `max_profit` remain unchanged from their initial values. The code snippet does not modify any of these variables. The `mid` variable is reassigned to the same value it already had, which is `(low + high) // 2`. The `profit_mid` and `profit_next` variables are also reassigned to the same values they already had, which are `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` and `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, respectively. The `max_profit` variable is updated to be the maximum of its original value and `profit_mid`, but since `profit_mid` is already equal to the maximum of its original value and `profit_mid`, the value of `max_profit` remains unchanged.
