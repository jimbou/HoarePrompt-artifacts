Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer. If the profit of mid + 1 is greater than the profit of mid, then low is updated to the average of the original low and high plus 1. Otherwise, high is updated to the average of low and high minus one. In both cases, mid is the average of the updated low and high, profit_mid is the result of func_1(mid, n, a, b), profit_next is the result of func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b), and max_profit is the maximum of the original max_profit and profit_mid.***
