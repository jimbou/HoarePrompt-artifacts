Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `low` is a positive integer and less than `mid`, `high` is a positive integer and equal to `mid - 1`, `mid` is a positive integer equal to `(low + high + 1) // 2`, `profit_mid` is a value equal to `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is a value equal to `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, `max_profit` is a value equal to the maximum of its original value and `profit_mid`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, `profit_next`, and `max_profit` remain the same as in the initial state. However, the value of `high` is updated to be one less than the current value of `mid`.
