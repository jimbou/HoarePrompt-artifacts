Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, low is a positive integer and less than or equal to high, high is a positive integer, mid is a positive integer equal to (low + high) // 2, profit_mid is a value equal to func_1(mid, n, a, b), profit_next is a value equal to func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b), max_profit is a value equal to the maximum of its original value and profit_mid.**

The code calculates the midpoint `mid` between `low` and `high`, then uses this value to compute `profit_mid` and `profit_next` by calling `func_1` with different arguments. Finally, it updates `max_profit` to be the maximum of its original value and `profit_mid`. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged.
