To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition in the `while` loop head, which is `low <= high`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `n` is a positive integer
* `a` is a positive integer
* `b` is a positive integer
* `low` is a positive integer and less than or equal to `high`
* `high` is a positive integer
* `mid` is a positive integer equal to `(low + high) // 2`
* `profit_mid` is a value equal to `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`
* `profit_next` is a value equal to `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`
* `max_profit` is a value equal to the maximum of its original value and `profit_mid`
* If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `low` and `high` such that `low <= high` is still true.

Since `low` is updated to `mid + 1` if `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, we need to ensure that `mid + 1` is less than or equal to `high`. Similarly, since `high` is updated to `mid - 1` otherwise, we need to ensure that `mid - 1` is greater than or equal to `low`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `high` to be greater than `mid`, and the state of `low` to be less than `mid + 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `low` is a positive integer and less than `mid + 1`, `high` is a positive integer and greater than `mid`, `mid` is a positive integer equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `profit_mid` is a value equal to `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is a value equal to `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, `max_profit` is a value equal to the maximum of its original value and `profit_mid`**
