Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit that Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The function `func_1` calculates the profit for a given value of k, and the function `func_2` uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value of k that maximizes the profit.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when k is 0 (all buns are sold at the usual price) and when k is equal to min(n, b) (all buns are sold at the modified price). The binary search approach in `func_2` ensures that the program finds the optimal value of k in an efficient manner.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
