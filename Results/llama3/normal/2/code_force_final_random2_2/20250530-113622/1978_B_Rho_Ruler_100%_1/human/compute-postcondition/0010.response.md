Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `low` is a positive integer and equal to `mid + 1`, `high` is a positive integer, `mid` is a positive integer equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `profit_mid` is a value equal to `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is a value equal to `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, `max_profit` is a value equal to the maximum of its original value and `profit_mid`.**

In this output state, the value of `low` has been updated to `mid + 1`, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `mid` and `low` and `high` is still valid, and the values of `profit_mid`, `profit_next`, and `max_profit` are still equal to their respective function calls.
