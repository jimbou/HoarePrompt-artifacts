Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, low is 0, high is the average of low and high minus one, mid is the average of low and high, profit_mid is the result of func_1(mid, n, a, b), profit_next is the result of func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b), max_profit is the maximum of the original max_profit and profit_mid. The profit of mid + 1 is less than or equal to the profit of mid**

In this output state, the value of high has been updated to be the average of low and high minus one, which is (low + high) / 2 - 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The profit of mid + 1 is still less than or equal to the profit of mid, as this condition was not affected by the update of high.
