Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `low` is a positive integer and equal to `mid + 1`, `high` is a positive integer and greater than `mid`, `mid` is a positive integer equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `profit_mid` is a value equal to `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is a value equal to `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, `max_profit` is a value equal to the maximum of its original value and `profit_mid`.**

In this output state, the value of `low` has been updated to `mid + 1`, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `low` and `mid` has also been updated to reflect the new value of `low`. The rest of the variables and their relationships remain the same as in the initial state.
