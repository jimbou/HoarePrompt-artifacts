To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `low <= high`. Given the initial states:

- `n` is a positive integer
- `a` is a positive integer
- `b` is a positive integer
- `low` is 0
- `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`
- `max_profit` is 0

The loop condition depends on the values of `low` and `high`. Since `low` is 0, for the loop to execute at least once, `high` must be greater than or equal to 0. Given that `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`, and both `n` and `b` are positive integers, `high` will always be a positive integer. Therefore, the condition `low <= high` is guaranteed to be true at least once without needing any adjustments to the states of `n`, `a`, `b`, or `max_profit`.

However, to explicitly state the condition that ensures the loop can execute, we acknowledge that `high` being a positive integer (which it is, by definition of `n` and `b` being positive integers) is sufficient for the loop to proceed. Thus, no additional constraints need to be added to the existing states for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `low` is 0, `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`, `max_profit` is 0**
