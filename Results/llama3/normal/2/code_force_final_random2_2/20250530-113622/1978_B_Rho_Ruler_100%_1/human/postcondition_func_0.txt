Calculates a value based on the input parameters k, n, a, and b, where k is a non-negative integer, n is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, and b is a positive integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b). The calculation involves multiplying k by b, subtracting the product of k and k-1 divided by 2, and adding the product of n-k and a. The function returns this calculated value.
