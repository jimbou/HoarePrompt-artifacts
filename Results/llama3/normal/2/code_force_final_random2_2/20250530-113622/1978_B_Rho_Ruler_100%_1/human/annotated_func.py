#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is a non-negative integer, n is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, and b is a positive integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b).
    return k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a
    #The program returns a value that is a result of a calculation involving the variables k, n, a, and b, where k is a non-negative integer, n is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, and b is a positive integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b). The calculation involves multiplying k by b, subtracting the product of k and k-1 divided by 2, and adding the product of n-k and a.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates a value based on the input parameters k, n, a, and b, where k is a non-negative integer, n is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, and b is a positive integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b). The calculation involves multiplying k by b, subtracting the product of k and k-1 divided by 2, and adding the product of n-k and a. The function returns this calculated value.

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)

        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
        
        if profit_next > profit_mid:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, low is equal to high, mid is equal to low and high, profit_mid is equal to func_1(mid, n, a, b), profit_next is equal to func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b), max_profit is the maximum of the original max_profit and profit_mid.
    return max_profit
    #The program returns the maximum of the original max_profit and profit_mid, where profit_mid is the result of function func_1 with arguments mid, n, a, and b, and mid is equal to low and high, which are equal to each other.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function determines the maximum profit that can be achieved by finding the optimal value of 'mid' within the range of 0 to the minimum of 'n' and 'b', where 'n', 'a', and 'b' are positive integers. It iteratively calculates the profit at the current 'mid' value and the next value, updating the maximum profit if a higher value is found. The function returns the maximum profit found during this process.
