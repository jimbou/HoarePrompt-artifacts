Output State: **stdin contains 1 input: a string of lowercase English letters of length at most 10, input() is greater than 0, _ is 0, s is a string of lowercase English letters of length at most 10, s2 is a string of the same letters as s but in a random order.**

In this output state, the first line of code assigns the integer value from stdin to s, leaving only the string in stdin. The second line creates a new string s2 by randomly rearranging the letters in s. The length of s2 is the same as s, and it contains the same letters, but in a different order. The values of input() and _ remain unchanged.
