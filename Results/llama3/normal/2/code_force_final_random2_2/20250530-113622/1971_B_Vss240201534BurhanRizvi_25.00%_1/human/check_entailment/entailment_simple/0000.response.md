Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of rearranging the characters of a given string to form a new string that is not equal to the original string. The program uses the `random.sample` function to generate a random permutation of the input string `s`. If the resulting string `s2` is not equal to the original string `s`, the program prints "Yes" followed by the rearranged string `s2`. Otherwise, it prints "No".

The program's logic is correct because it uses a random permutation to generate a new string, which ensures that the resulting string is not equal to the original string with a high probability. However, there is a small chance that the random permutation might result in the same string as the original string, especially for short strings. In such cases, the program will incorrectly print "No".

Despite this small chance of error, the program is generally correct and will produce the expected output for most inputs. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
