To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `input()` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `input()` must still be greater than 0.

Since `input()` is an expression that reads input from stdin, its value is not directly affected by the loop iteration. However, we can assume that the input is still available and has not been exhausted.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **stdin contains 1 input: a string of lowercase English letters of length at most 10, input() is greater than 1, _ is 1, s is a string of lowercase English letters of length at most 10, s2 is a string of the same letters as s but in a random order.**
