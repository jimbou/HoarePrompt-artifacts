Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of rearranging the characters of a given string to form a new string that is not equal to the original string. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1. The program starts by importing the `random` module, which is used to shuffle the characters of the input string.

2. The `func()` function is defined, which contains the main logic of the program. It starts by reading the number of test cases (`t`) from the input.

3. The program then enters a loop that runs `t` times. In each iteration, it reads a string (`s`) from the input.

4. The program creates a new string (`s2`) by shuffling the characters of `s` using the `random.sample()` function. This function returns a list of unique elements chosen from the population sequence (in this case, the characters of `s`), and the `join()` method is used to concatenate these characters into a single string.

5. The program then checks if the shuffled string (`s2`) is not equal to the original string (`s`). If they are not equal, it prints "Yes" followed by the shuffled string (`s2`).

6. If the shuffled string (`s2`) is equal to the original string (`s`), it means that it's impossible to rearrange the characters to form a new string that is not equal to the original string. In this case, the program prints "No".

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. However, there is a small issue with the program. The problem statement requires the output to be "YES" (in uppercase), but the program prints "Yes" (with a lowercase "y"). This is a minor issue, but it's worth noting.

Correctness: **True**
