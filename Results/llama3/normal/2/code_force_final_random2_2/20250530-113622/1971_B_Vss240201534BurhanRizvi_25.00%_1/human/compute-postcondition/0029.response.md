Output State: **_ is the integer input from stdin, stdin is empty, s is a string of lowercase English letters of length at most 10, s2 is a string of the same letters as s but in a random order. If s is not equal to s2, 'Yes' is printed and s2 is printed. If s is equal to s2, 'No' is printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop counter `_` will be equal to the initial integer input from `stdin`. The `stdin` will be empty because all inputs have been consumed by the loop. The variables `s` and `s2` will still be strings of lowercase English letters of length at most 10, with `s2` being a random permutation of `s`. The output will depend on whether `s` and `s2` are equal or not, printing 'Yes' and `s2` if they are not equal, and 'No' if they are equal.
