Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the problem's requirements by generating a random permutation of the input string and checking if it is different from the original string. If it is different, it prints 'Yes' followed by the permutation; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The program repeats this process for the specified number of test cases.

The use of the `random.sample` function ensures that the generated permutation is indeed random and not just a simple rotation or other predictable transformation of the original string. This is important because the problem statement requires that the output string be different from the original string, and a random permutation is a good way to achieve this.

The only potential issue with the program is that it relies on randomness to generate a different permutation, which means that there is a small chance that it could generate the same permutation as the original string, even if the string has multiple possible permutations. However, this chance is extremely low, especially for longer strings, and the program's behavior is still correct in the sense that it will eventually terminate and produce a correct output.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution summary, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
