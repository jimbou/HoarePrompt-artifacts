Correctness: **False**.

The program does not guarantee that the rearranged string `s2` will be different from the original string `s`. In the case where the original string `s` has only one unique character (e.g., "aaaaa"), the program will always print "No", which is correct. However, when the original string `s` has more than one unique character, the program uses `random.sample` to generate a new string `s2`. Although the probability of `s2` being the same as `s` is low, it is not zero. 

For example, if the input is "ab", there is a small chance that `random.sample` will generate the same string "ab", and the program will incorrectly print "No". 

To fix this issue, the program should check all possible permutations of the string `s` and return the first one that is different from `s`. Alternatively, it could use a more efficient algorithm to find a different permutation, such as swapping the first two characters if they are different.
