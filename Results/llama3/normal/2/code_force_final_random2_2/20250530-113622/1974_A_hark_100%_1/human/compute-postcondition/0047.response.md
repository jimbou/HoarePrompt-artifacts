Postcondition: ***`ap` is an integer between 3 and 10^4, `k` is 2, `x` is an integer between -1485 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin contains no input. If `x` is 0 and `y` is positive, the ceiling of `y` divided by 2 is printed. If `x` is positive and `y` is 0, the smallest integer not less than `x` divided by 15 is printed. Otherwise, 0 is printed.***
