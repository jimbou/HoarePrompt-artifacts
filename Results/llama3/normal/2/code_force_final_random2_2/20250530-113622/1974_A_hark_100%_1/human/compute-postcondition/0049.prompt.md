Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ap` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t inputs: two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)
Code of the loop:
for k in range(ap):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ap` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `k` is 0, `x` is an integer between -1485 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin contains t-1 inputs: two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If `x` > 0 and `y` > 0, the sum of bxsfory1 and bxsfory is being printed. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the ceiling of half of the current value of `y` is being printed. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the ceiling of the division of the current value of `x` by 15 is being printed. Otherwise, 0 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ap` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `k` is 1. If `x` > 0 and `y` > 0, then `x` is an integer between -1485 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, and the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory` is printed. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the ceiling of `y` divided by 2 is printed. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the ceiling of `x` divided by 15 is printed. Otherwise, the value 0 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ap` is an integer between 3 and 10^4, `k` is 2, `x` is an integer between -1485 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin contains no input. If `x` > 0 and `y` > 0, the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory` is printed, which is an integer between 0 and 58. If `x` is 0 and `y` is positive, the ceiling of `y` divided by 2 is printed. If `x` is positive and `y` is 0, the smallest integer not less than `x` divided by 15 is printed. Otherwise, 0 is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
