Output State: **`ap` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `k` is 1, `x` is an integer between 0 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin contains t-3 inputs: two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)**

In this output state, the values of `ap` and `k` remain unchanged. The values of `x` and `y` are updated to be integers between 0 and 99, as they are assigned the values from the input. The stdin now contains t-3 inputs, as two space-separated integers x and y have been read from the input.
