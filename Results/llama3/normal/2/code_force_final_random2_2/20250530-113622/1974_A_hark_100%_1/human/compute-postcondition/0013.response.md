The code prints the ceiling of the division of the current value of `x` by 15. Since the current value of `x` is greater than 0 and `x` is an integer between 0 and 99, the value of `x` is a positive integer less than or equal to 99.

Output: **the ceiling of the division of the current value of x by 15 (where x is a positive integer less than or equal to 99)**
