Postcondition: ***`ap` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `k` is 1, `x` is an integer between 0 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin contains t-3 inputs: two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If x > 0 and y == 0, the ceiling of x divided by 15 is printed. Otherwise, the value 0 is printed.***
