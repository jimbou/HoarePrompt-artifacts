Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

# Annotated Program:
import math

func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains t+1 inputs: the first input is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), the following t inputs are two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x > 0 and y > 0:
            bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
            x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
            bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
            print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        elif x == 0 and y > 0:
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
        elif x > 0 and y == 0:
            print(math.ceil(x / 15))
        else:
            print(0)
        
    #State: `ap` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `k` is `ap`, `x` is an integer between -1485 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin contains no input. If `x` > 0 and `y` > 0, the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory` is printed, which is an integer between 0 and 58. If `x` is 0 and `y` is positive, the ceiling of `y` divided by 2 is printed. If `x` is positive and `y` is 0, the smallest integer not less than `x` divided by 15 is printed. Otherwise, 0 is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of inputs from stdin, where the first input is an integer t, and the following t inputs are pairs of integers x and y. For each pair, it calculates and prints a value based on the values of x and y. If both x and y are positive, it calculates the sum of the ceiling of y divided by 2 and the ceiling of x minus the product of the ceiling of y divided by 2 and 15, plus the product of y and 4, divided by 15. If x is 0 and y is positive, it prints the ceiling of y divided by 2. If x is positive and y is 0, it prints the ceiling of x divided by 15. If both x and y are 0, it prints 0. The function processes all input pairs and then terminates, leaving stdin empty.
