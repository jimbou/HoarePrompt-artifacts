Output State: **`ap` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `k` is 0, `x` is an integer between 0 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin contains t-1 inputs: two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)**

In this output state, the values of `ap` and `k` remain unchanged. The variables `x` and `y` are assigned the values of the first two space-separated integers from the input, which are between 0 and 99. The stdin now contains t-1 inputs, as one input has been consumed by the `input().split()` function.
