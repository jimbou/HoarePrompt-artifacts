Output State: **ap is an integer between 3 and 10^4, k is 2, x is an integer between -1485 and 99, y is an integer between 0 and 99, bxsfory is an integer between 0 and 49, bxsfory1 is an integer between 0 and 9**

The code first calculates the ceiling of y divided by 2 and assigns it to bxsfory. Since y is an integer between 0 and 99, bxsfory will be an integer between 0 and 49. Then, it updates the value of x by subtracting bxsfory multiplied by 15 and adding y multiplied by 4. This operation does not change the range of x, which remains an integer between -1485 and 99. Finally, it calculates the ceiling of x divided by 15 and assigns it to bxsfory1 if x is greater than 0, otherwise, it assigns 0 to bxsfory1. Since x is an integer between -1485 and 99, bxsfory1 will be an integer between 0 and 9. The values of ap and k remain unchanged.
