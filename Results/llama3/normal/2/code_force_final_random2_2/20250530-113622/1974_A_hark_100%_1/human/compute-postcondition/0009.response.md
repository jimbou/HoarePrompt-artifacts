The code prints the ceiling of the division of the current value of `y` by 2.
Since the current value of `y` is greater than 0 and `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, the ceiling of the division of `y` by 2 will be an integer between 1 and 50.
Output: **an integer between 1 and 50 (which is the ceiling of the division of the current value of y by 2)**
