Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when x = 13 and y = 1, the program will output 1, but the correct output should be 2. This is because 13 1x1 icons and 1 2x2 icon cannot fit on one screen, as the 2x2 icon will occupy 4 cells, leaving only 11 cells for the 1x1 icons, which is not enough.

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly calculate the number of screens needed when there are both 1x1 and 2x2 icons. The program tries to calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons separately and then adds the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. However, this approach does not take into account the fact that the 2x2 icons can occupy cells that would otherwise be available for the 1x1 icons.

A correct solution would need to take into account the total number of cells needed for all icons and then calculate the minimum number of screens needed to accommodate those cells.
