The code accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The stdin contains t+1 inputs: the first input is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), the following t inputs are two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). So the first input is assigned into ap. Now stdin contains t inputs: two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). The values of the other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`ap` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t inputs: two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)**
