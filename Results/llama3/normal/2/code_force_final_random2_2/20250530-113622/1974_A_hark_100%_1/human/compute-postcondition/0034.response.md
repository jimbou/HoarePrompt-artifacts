Postcondition: ***`ap` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `k` is 1. If `x` > 0 and `y` > 0, then `x` is an integer between -1485 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, and the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory` is printed. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the ceiling of `y` divided by 2 is printed. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the ceiling of `x` divided by 15 is printed. Otherwise, the value 0 is printed.***
