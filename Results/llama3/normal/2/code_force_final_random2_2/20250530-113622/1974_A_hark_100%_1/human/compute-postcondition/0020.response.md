Postcondition: ***`ap` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `k` is 0, `x` is an integer between -1485 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin contains t-1 inputs: two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If `x` > 0 and `y` > 0, the sum of bxsfory1 and bxsfory is being printed. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the ceiling of half of the current value of `y` is being printed. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the ceiling of the division of the current value of `x` by 15 is being printed. Otherwise, 0 is being printed.***
