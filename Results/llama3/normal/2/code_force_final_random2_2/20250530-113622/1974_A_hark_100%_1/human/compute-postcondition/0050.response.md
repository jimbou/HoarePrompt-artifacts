Functionality: **This function reads a series of inputs from stdin, where the first input is an integer t, and the following t inputs are pairs of integers x and y. For each pair, it calculates and prints a value based on the values of x and y. If both x and y are positive, it calculates the sum of the ceiling of y divided by 2 and the ceiling of x minus the product of the ceiling of y divided by 2 and 15, plus the product of y and 4, divided by 15. If x is 0 and y is positive, it prints the ceiling of y divided by 2. If x is positive and y is 0, it prints the ceiling of x divided by 15. If both x and y are 0, it prints 0. The function processes all input pairs and then terminates, leaving stdin empty.**
