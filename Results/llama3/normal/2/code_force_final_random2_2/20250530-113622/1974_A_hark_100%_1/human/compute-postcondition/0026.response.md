The `print(math.ceil(y / 2))` statement will print the ceiling of half of the value of `y`, which is an integer between 0 and 99.

Since `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, half of `y` will be a decimal value between 0 and 49.5. The `math.ceil` function will round up this decimal value to the nearest integer.

Therefore, the output will be the ceiling of half of the value of `y`, which is an integer between 0 and 50.

Output: **the ceiling of half of the value of y (where y is an integer between 0 and 99)**
