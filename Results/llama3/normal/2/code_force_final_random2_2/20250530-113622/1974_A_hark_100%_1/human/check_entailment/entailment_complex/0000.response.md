Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `x` and `y` and calculates the minimum number of screens required based on the problem description.
3. The program correctly handles the cases where `x` and `y` are both positive, `x` is 0 and `y` is positive, `x` is positive and `y` is 0, and both `x` and `y` are 0.
4. The program uses the `math.ceil` function to calculate the ceiling of the division, which is correct according to the problem description.
5. The program prints the calculated value for each test case, which is correct.

The only potential issue is that the program does not check if the input values are within the specified ranges (0 <= x, y <= 99). However, since the problem statement assumes valid inputs, this is not a concern.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
