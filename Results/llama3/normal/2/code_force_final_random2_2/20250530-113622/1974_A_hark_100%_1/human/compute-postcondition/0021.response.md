The only variable in the loop head is variable  k and ap, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `ap`. If `k` is less than `ap`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 0, `ap` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be increased by 1 and `ap` must be greater than 1.
State: **`ap` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `k` is 1, `x` is an integer between -1485 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin contains t-2 inputs: two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)**
