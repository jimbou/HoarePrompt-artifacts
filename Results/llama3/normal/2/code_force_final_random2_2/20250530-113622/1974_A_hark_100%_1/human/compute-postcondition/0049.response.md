Output State: **`ap` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `k` is `ap`, `x` is an integer between -1485 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin contains no input. If `x` > 0 and `y` > 0, the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory` is printed, which is an integer between 0 and 58. If `x` is 0 and `y` is positive, the ceiling of `y` divided by 2 is printed. If `x` is positive and `y` is 0, the smallest integer not less than `x` divided by 15 is printed. Otherwise, 0 is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `ap` will be between 0 and 10^4, and `k` will be equal to `ap`. The values of `x` and `y` will still be within their respective ranges, but there will be no more input in stdin. The loop will have finished executing, and the final output will depend on the values of `x` and `y` at the end of the loop. If both `x` and `y` are positive, the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory` will be printed, which will be an integer between 0 and 58. If `x` is 0 and `y` is positive, the ceiling of `y` divided by 2 will be printed. If `x` is positive and `y` is 0, the smallest integer not less than `x` divided by 15 will be printed. Otherwise, 0 will be printed.
