The `print(math.ceil(y / 2))` statement will print the ceiling of the division of `y` by 2.

Since `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, the division of `y` by 2 will result in a value between 0 and 49.5.

The `math.ceil` function will round this value up to the nearest integer.

Therefore, the output will be an integer between 0 and 50.

Output: **an integer between 0 and 50 (inclusive)**
