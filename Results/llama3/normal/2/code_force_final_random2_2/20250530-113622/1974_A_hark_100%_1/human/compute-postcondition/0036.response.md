Output State: **`ap` is an integer between 3 and 10^4, `k` is 2, `x` is an integer between -1485 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin contains no input**.

In this output state, the values of `ap` and `k` remain unchanged. The variables `x` and `y` are assigned new values based on the input provided, which is a space-separated list of two integers. The input is consumed, leaving the stdin empty. The conditions related to the values of `x` and `y` are no longer applicable as their values have been updated.
