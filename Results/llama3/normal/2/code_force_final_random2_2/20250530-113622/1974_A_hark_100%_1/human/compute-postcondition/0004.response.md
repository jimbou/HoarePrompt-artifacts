Output State: **ap is an integer between 1 and 10^4, k is 0, x is an integer between -1485 and 99, y is an integer between 0 and 99, bxsfory is an integer between 1 and 50, bxsfory1 is an integer between 0 and 7, stdin contains t-1 inputs: two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)**

The code first calculates the value of `bxsfory` by dividing `y` by 2 and rounding up to the nearest integer. Since `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, `bxsfory` will be an integer between 1 and 50.

The second line updates the value of `x` by subtracting the product of `bxsfory` and 15, and then adding the product of `y` and 4. Since `x` is initially an integer between 0 and 99, and `bxsfory` is an integer between 1 and 50, the product `bxsfory * 15` will be an integer between 15 and 750. Subtracting this from `x` could result in a negative value, so `x` will be an integer between -1485 and 99. The addition of `y * 4` will not change the range of `x`.

The third line calculates the value of `bxsfory1` by dividing `x` by 15 and rounding up to the nearest integer, but only if `x` is greater than 0. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, `bxsfory1` will be 0. Since `x` is an integer between -1485 and 99, `bxsfory1` will be an integer between 0 and 7.

The values of `ap` and `k` are not modified by the code, so they remain the same. The stdin still contains t-1 inputs: two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).
