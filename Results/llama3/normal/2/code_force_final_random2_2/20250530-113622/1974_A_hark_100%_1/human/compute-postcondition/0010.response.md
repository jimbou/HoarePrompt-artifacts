Output: **`ap` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `k` is 0, `x` is an integer between 0 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin contains t-1 inputs: two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). The current value of `x` is 0 and the current value of `y` is greater than 0, and the ceiling of half of the current value of `y` is being printed**
