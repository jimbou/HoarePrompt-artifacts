Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer between -396 and 750, `t2` is an integer between 1 and 849 and is a multiple of 15, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 if `t` is odd, otherwise `t` is an integer between 0 and 49, stdin contains n-1 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

The code `t = t + t2 // 15` increments the value of `t` by the integer division of `t2` by 15. Since `t2` is a multiple of 15, the result of `t2 // 15` is an integer. The value of `t` is updated, but its parity (even or odd) is not changed. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains n-1 pairs of integers.
