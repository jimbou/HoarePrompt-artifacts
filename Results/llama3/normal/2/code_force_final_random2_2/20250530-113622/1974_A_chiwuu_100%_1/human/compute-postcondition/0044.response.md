Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer between -198 and 750, `t2` is an integer between -750 and 99, `t` is an integer between -6 and 101, stdin contains n-5 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated to be the sum of its original value, `t2` divided by 15, and 1. The range of `t` has been updated to be between -6 and 101, considering the possible values of `t2` and the original range of `t`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains n-5 pairs of integers x and y.
