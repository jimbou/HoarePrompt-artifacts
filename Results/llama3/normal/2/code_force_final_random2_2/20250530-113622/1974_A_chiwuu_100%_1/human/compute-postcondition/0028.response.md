Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer between -396 and 750, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is an integer between -396 and 99, `t2` is equal to `a - t * 15 + b * 4`, stdin contains `n-3` pairs of integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99). If `t` is even, `t` is an integer between 0 and 49. If `t` is odd, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50.**

In this output state, the value of `t2` is calculated by subtracting `t1` from `a`. Since `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, we can substitute this expression into the calculation of `t2`. This results in `t2` being equal to `a - t * 15 + b * 4`. The range of `t2` is determined by the ranges of `a`, `t`, and `b`, which are integers between 0 and 99, 0 and 49 (if even), or 1 and 50 (if odd), and 0 and 99, respectively. The other variables and stdin remain unchanged.
