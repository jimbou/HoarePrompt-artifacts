Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer between -198 and 750, `t` is either an integer between 0 and 49 or an integer between 1 and 50 depending on whether `t` is even or odd, stdin contains n-5 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

The code `t = t` does not change the value of `t`, so the output state is the same as the initial state. The value of `t` is still dependent on whether it is even or odd, and its range is still between 0 and 49 if even, or between 1 and 50 if odd. All other variables and the stdin remain unchanged.
