Postcondition: ***n is greater than 2, i is 2, a is an integer between 0 and 99, b is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin contains n-5 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If t is even, t is an integer between 0 and 49, t1 is an integer between -198 and 375. If t is odd, t is an integer between 1 and 50, t1 is an integer between -396 and 750 and t1 is equal to t * 15 - b * 4.***
