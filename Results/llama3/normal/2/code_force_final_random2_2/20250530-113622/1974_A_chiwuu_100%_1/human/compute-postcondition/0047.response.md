The code prints the value of `t`, which is determined by the conditions involving `t1`, `a`, and `t2`.

If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` is either an integer between 0 and 49 (if `t` is even) or an integer between 1 and 50 (if `t` is odd).

If `t1` is less than `a`, the value of `t2` is considered. If `t2` is a multiple of 15, `t` is either an integer between -49 and 100 (if `t` is even) or an integer between -48 and 101 (if `t` is odd).

If `t2` is not a multiple of 15, `t` is an integer between -6 and 101.

Output: **t (where t is an integer between 0 and 50, or between -49 and 101, or between -6 and 101, depending on the values of t1, a, and t2)**
