Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer between -396 and 750, stdin is empty. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` is an integer between 0 and 50. If `t1` is less than `a`, then if `t2` is a multiple of 15, `t` is an integer between 0 and 50 if `t` is even, otherwise `t` is an integer between 1 and 50. Otherwise, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `n` will be greater than or equal to 0, and `i` will be equal to `n`. The values of `a` and `b` will still be integers between 0 and 99. The value of `t1` will be an integer between -396 and 750. The standard input will be empty, as all pairs of integers will have been processed. The value of `t` will depend on the values of `t1` and `t2`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` will be an integer between 0 and 50. If `t1` is less than `a`, then if `t2` is a multiple of 15, `t` will be an integer between 0 and 50 if `t` is even, otherwise `t` will be an integer between 1 and 50. Otherwise, `t` will be an integer between 1 and 100.
