Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is 0, a is an integer between 0 and 99, b is an integer between 0 and 99, t is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin contains n-1 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)**

The code reads a pair of integers from stdin, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The value of `t` is set to the value of `b`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Stdin now contains one less pair of integers.
