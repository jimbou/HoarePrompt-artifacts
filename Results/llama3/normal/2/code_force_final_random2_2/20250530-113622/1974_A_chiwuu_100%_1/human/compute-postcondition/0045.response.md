Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer between -198 and 750, `t2` is an integer between -750 and 99, stdin contains n-5 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If `t2` is a multiple of 15, `t` is an integer between -49 and 100 if `t` is even, and `t` is an integer between -48 and 101 if `t` is odd. Otherwise, `t` is an integer between -6 and 101.***
