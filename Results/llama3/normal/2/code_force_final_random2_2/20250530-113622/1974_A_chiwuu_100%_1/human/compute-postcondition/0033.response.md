Based on the precondition, the value of `t` is determined by a series of conditions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` remains unchanged. In this case, `t` is either an even integer between 0 and 49 or an odd integer between 1 and 50.

2. If `t1` is less than `a`, then `t2` is calculated as `a - t * 15 + b * 4`. The value of `t2` is between -396 and 99.

3. If `t2` is divisible by 15, then `t` is an integer between 0 and 50. Otherwise, `t` is an integer between 1 and 51.

Since the exact values of `t1`, `a`, `b`, and `t2` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `t`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `t`.

Output: **t (where t is an integer between 0 and 51, determined by the conditions described in the precondition)**
