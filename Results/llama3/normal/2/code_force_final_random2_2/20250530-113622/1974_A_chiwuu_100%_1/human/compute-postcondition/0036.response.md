Output State: **n is greater than 2, i is 2, a is an integer between 0 and 99, b is an integer between 0 and 99, t1 is an integer between -396 and 750, t1 is equal to t * 15 - b * 4, t is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin contains n-5 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

The code reads a pair of integers from stdin and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The value of `t` is set to `b`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `t1` remain unchanged. The range of `t` is updated to be between 0 and 99, as it is now equal to `b`. The number of pairs of integers in stdin is reduced by 1.
