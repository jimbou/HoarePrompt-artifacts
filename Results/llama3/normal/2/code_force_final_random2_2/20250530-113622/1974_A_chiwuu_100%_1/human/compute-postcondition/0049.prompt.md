Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `n` pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b = input().split()
    a = int(a)
    b = int(b)
    t = b
    if t % 2 == 0:
        t = t // 2
    else:
        t = t // 2 + 1
    t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
    if t1 >= a:
        t = t
    else:
        t2 = a - t1
        if t2 % 15 == 0:
            t = t + t2 // 15
        else:
            t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
    print(t)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer between -396 and 750, stdin contains n-1 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` is an integer between 0 and 50. If `t1` is less than `a`, then if `t2` is a multiple of 15, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 if `t` is odd, otherwise `t` is an integer between 0 and 49. Otherwise, `t` is an integer between 2 and 100. and the value of `t` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer between -396 and 750, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, stdin contains `n-3` pairs of integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99). If `t` is even, `t` is an integer between 0 and 49. If `t` is odd, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t2` is an integer between -396 and 99, `t2` is equal to `a - t * 15 + b * 4`, and `t` is an integer between 0 and 51. If `t` is even, `t` is an integer between 0 and 50. If `t` is odd, `t` is an integer between 1 and 51. If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is an integer between 0 and 50. Otherwise, `t` is an integer between 1 and 51, and the value of `t` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer between -198 and 750, stdin contains n-5 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` is either an integer between 0 and 49 or an integer between 1 and 50 depending on whether `t` is even or odd. Otherwise, if `t2` is a multiple of 15, `t` is an integer between -49 and 100 if `t` is even, and `t` is an integer between -48 and 101 if `t` is odd. If `t2` is not a multiple of 15, `t` is an integer between -6 and 101, and the value of `t` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
