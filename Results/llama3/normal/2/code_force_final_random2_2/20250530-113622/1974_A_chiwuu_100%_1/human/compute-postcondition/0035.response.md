State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer between -396 and 750, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, stdin contains `n-4` pairs of integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99). If `t` is even, `t` is an integer between 0 and 49. If `t` is odd, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t2` is an integer between -396 and 99, `t2` is equal to `a - t * 15 + b * 4`, and `t` is an integer between 0 and 51. If `t` is even, `t` is an integer between 0 and 50. If `t` is odd, `t` is an integer between 1 and 51. If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is an integer between 0 and 50. Otherwise, `t` is an integer between 1 and 51, and the value of `t` is being printed**
