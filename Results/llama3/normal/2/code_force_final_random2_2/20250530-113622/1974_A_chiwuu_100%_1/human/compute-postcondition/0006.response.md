Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains n-1 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated to be the integer division of the original value of `t` by 2, plus 1. Since `t` was originally an odd integer between 0 and 99, the new value of `t` will be an integer between 1 and 50. The values of the other variables and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
