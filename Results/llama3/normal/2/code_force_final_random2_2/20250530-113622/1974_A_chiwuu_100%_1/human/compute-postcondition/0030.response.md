Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer between -396 and 750, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is an integer between -396 and 99, `t2` is equal to `a - t * 15 + b * 4`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 51, if `t` is even, `t` is an integer between 2 and 50, if `t` is odd, `t` is an integer between 1 and 51, stdin contains `n-3` pairs of integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99).**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated to be `t + t2 // 15 + 1`. Since `t2` is an integer between -396 and 99, `t2 // 15` can be an integer between -26 and 6. Adding 1 to this value gives a range of -25 to 7. Adding this value to `t` gives a new range of 1 to 51 for `t`. If `t` is even, its range is 2 to 50, and if `t` is odd, its range is 1 to 51. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
