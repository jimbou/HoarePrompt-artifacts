Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer between -396 and 750, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is an integer between -396 and 99, `t2` is equal to `a - t * 15 + b * 4`, `t` is an integer between 0 and 50, if `t` is even, `t` is an integer between 0 and 49, if `t` is odd, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains `n-3` pairs of integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99).**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated to be the sum of its original value and the integer division of `t2` by 15. The other variables remain unchanged. The range of `t` has been updated to be between 0 and 50, with the additional constraints that if `t` is even, it is between 0 and 49, and if `t` is odd, it is between 1 and 50. The stdin still contains `n-3` pairs of integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99).
