Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 icons `a` and the number of 2x2 icons `b`.
3. It calculates the minimum number of screens required for the 2x2 icons `t` by dividing `b` by 2 and rounding up if necessary.
4. It calculates the remaining space on the screens allocated for 2x2 icons `t1` by multiplying `t` by 15 (the total number of cells on a screen) and subtracting the number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons (`b` * 4).
5. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, it means that the remaining space on the screens allocated for 2x2 icons is sufficient to accommodate all 1x1 icons, so the program prints `t`.
6. If `t1` is less than `a`, it means that additional screens are needed to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons. The program calculates the number of additional screens required `t2` by subtracting `t1` from `a` and dividing by 15 (the number of cells on a screen). If `t2` is not a multiple of 15, it adds 1 to `t2` to round up. Finally, it adds `t2` to `t` and prints the result.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when `a` and `b` are 0, and when `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`. The output matches the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
