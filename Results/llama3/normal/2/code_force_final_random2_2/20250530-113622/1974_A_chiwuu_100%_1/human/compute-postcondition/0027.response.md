Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer between -396 and 750, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is equal to `t`, stdin contains `n-3` pairs of integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99). If `t` is even, `t` is an integer between 0 and 49. If `t` is odd, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state because the given code `t = t` does not change the values of any variables. The variable `t` is assigned its own value, which means its value remains the same. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
