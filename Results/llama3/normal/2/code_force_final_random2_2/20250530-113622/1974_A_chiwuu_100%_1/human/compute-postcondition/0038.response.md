Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer between -396 and 750, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains `n-5` pairs of integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99).**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` has been updated to be half of its original value plus one, which results in a new range of 1 to 50. All other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `n-5` pairs of integers `x` and `y` within the range 0 to 99.
