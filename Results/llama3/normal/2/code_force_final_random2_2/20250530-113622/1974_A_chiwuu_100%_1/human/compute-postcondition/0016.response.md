Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer between -396 and 750, `t2` is an integer between 1 and 849, `t1` is less than `a`, `t` is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains n-1 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated to be the sum of its original value and the integer division of `t2` by 15 plus 1. The original value of `t` was either an integer between 0 and 49 (if `t` was even) or an integer between 1 and 50 (if `t` was odd). The integer division of `t2` by 15 is an integer between 0 and 56 (since `t2` is an integer between 1 and 849). Therefore, the new value of `t` is an integer between 2 and 100. The values of the other variables and the stdin remain unchanged.
