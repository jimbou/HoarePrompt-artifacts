Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer between -198 and 750, stdin contains n-5 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If `t` is even, `t` is an integer between 0 and 49. If `t` is odd, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50.**

In this output state, the value of `t1` has been updated to be equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, which is a combination of the values of `t` and `b`. The range of `t1` has been updated to be between -198 and 750, which is the result of the calculation. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains n-5 pairs of integers x and y.
