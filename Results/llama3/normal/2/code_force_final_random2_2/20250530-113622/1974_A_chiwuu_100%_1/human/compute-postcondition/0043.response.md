Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer between -198 and 750, `t2` is an integer between -750 and 99, `t` is an integer between -49 and 100 if `t` is even, and `t` is an integer between -48 and 101 if `t` is odd, stdin contains n-5 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated by adding `t2 // 15` to it. The range of `t` has been updated accordingly, taking into account the possible values of `t2` and the fact that `t` can be either even or odd. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains n-5 pairs of integers x and y.
