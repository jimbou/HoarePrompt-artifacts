Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer between -396 and 750, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, stdin contains `n-3` pairs of integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99). If `t` is even, `t` is an integer between 0 and 49. If `t` is odd, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t1` has been updated to be equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, where `t` and `b` are integers within their respective ranges. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `n-3` pairs of integers `x` and `y` within the range 0 to 99. The parity of `t` still determines its range, with even `t` between 0 and 49, and odd `t` between 1 and 50.
