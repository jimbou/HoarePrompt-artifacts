Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer between -396 and 750, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is an integer between -396 and 99, `t2` is equal to `a - t * 15 + b * 4`, `t` is an integer between 0 and 51, if `t` is even, `t` is an integer between 0 and 50, if `t` is odd, `t` is an integer between 1 and 51, stdin contains `n-3` pairs of integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99). If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is an integer between 0 and 50. Otherwise, `t` is an integer between 1 and 51.**
