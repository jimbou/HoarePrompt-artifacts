Output State: **n is greater than 1, i is 1, a is an integer between 0 and 99, b is an integer between 0 and 99, t1 is an integer between -396 and 750, t is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin contains n-3 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

The code block reads a pair of integers from stdin, assigns the first integer to `a` and the second integer to `b`, and then assigns the value of `b` to `t`. The value of `n` is not affected by the code, so it remains greater than 1. The value of `i` is also not affected, so it remains 1. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to be integers between 0 and 99, as they are read from stdin. The value of `t1` is not affected by the code, so it remains an integer between -396 and 750. The value of `t` is updated to be an integer between 0 and 99, as it is assigned the value of `b`. The stdin now contains n-3 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99), as one pair has been read.
