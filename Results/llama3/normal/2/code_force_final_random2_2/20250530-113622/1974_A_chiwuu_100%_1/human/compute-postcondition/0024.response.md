Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer between -396 and 750, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains n-3 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated to be half of its original value plus 1. Since `t` was originally an integer between 0 and 99, its new value will be an integer between 1 and 50. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains n-3 pairs of integers x and y, where 0 <= x, y <= 99.
