Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer between -198 and 750, `t2` is an integer between -750 and 99, stdin contains n-5 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If `t` is even, `t` is an integer between 0 and 49. If `t` is odd, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50.**

In this output state, the value of `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`, where `a` is an integer between 0 and 99 and `t1` is an integer between -198 and 750. This results in `t2` being an integer between -750 and 99. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains n-5 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). The conditions on `t` also remain the same.
