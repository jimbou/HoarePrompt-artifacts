Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer between -396 and 750, stdin contains n-1 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If t is even, t is an integer between 0 and 49. Otherwise, t is an integer between 1 and 50.**

In this output state, the value of `t1` is calculated based on the initial state of `t` and `b`. Since `t` can be either even or odd, and `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, the range of `t1` is calculated as follows:

- If `t` is even (between 0 and 49), `t1` = `t` * 15 - `b` * 4, which results in a range of -396 (when `t` = 0 and `b` = 99) to 735 (when `t` = 49 and `b` = 0).
- If `t` is odd (between 1 and 50), `t1` = `t` * 15 - `b` * 4, which results in a range of -396 (when `t` = 1 and `b` = 99) to 750 (when `t` = 50 and `b` = 0).

The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains n-1 pairs of integers x and y.
