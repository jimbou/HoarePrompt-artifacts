Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `n` pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)**

In this output state, the value of `n` is assigned the integer value from the first input in stdin, which is between 1 and 10^4. The remaining inputs in stdin are `n` pairs of integers x and y, where each x and y is between 0 and 99.
