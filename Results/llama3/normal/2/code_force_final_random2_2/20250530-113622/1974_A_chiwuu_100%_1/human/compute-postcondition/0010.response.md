Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer between -396 and 750 and is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` is an integer between 0 and 50, stdin contains n-1 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)**.

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `t1`, and stdin remain unchanged. The only change is that `t` is now assigned the value of itself, which means its value remains the same. The range of `t` is still between 0 and 50, depending on whether it is even or odd.
