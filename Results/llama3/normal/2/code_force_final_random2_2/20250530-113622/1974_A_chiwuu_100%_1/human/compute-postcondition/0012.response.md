Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer between -396 and 750, `t2` is an integer between 1 and 849, `t1` is less than `a`, stdin contains n-1 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If t is even, t is an integer between 0 and 49. Otherwise, t is an integer between 1 and 50.**

In this output state, the value of `t2` is calculated as the difference between `a` and `t1`, where `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, and `t1` is an integer between -396 and 750. Since `t1` is less than `a`, the value of `t2` will be a positive integer between 1 and 849. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
