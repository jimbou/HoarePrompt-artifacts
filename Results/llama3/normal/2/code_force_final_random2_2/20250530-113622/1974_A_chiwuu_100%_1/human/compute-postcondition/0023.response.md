Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer between -396 and 750, `t` is an integer between 0 and 49, stdin contains n-3 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

The value of `t` is updated to be half of its original value, which was an integer between 0 and 99. Since the original value of `t` was an integer, the new value of `t` will be an integer between 0 and 49. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains n-3 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).
