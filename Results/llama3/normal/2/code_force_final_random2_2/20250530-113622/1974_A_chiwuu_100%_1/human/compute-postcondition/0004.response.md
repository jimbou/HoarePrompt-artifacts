Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t` is an integer between 0 and 49, and the current value of `t` is an integer, stdin contains n-1 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)**.

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated to be half of its original value, which was an even integer between 0 and 99. Therefore, the new value of `t` is an integer between 0 and 49. The values of the other variables, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and the contents of stdin, remain unchanged.
