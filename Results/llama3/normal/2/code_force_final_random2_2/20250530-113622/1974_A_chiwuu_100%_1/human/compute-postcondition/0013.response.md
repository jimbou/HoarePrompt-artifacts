Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer between -396 and 750, `t2` is an integer between 1 and 849, `t1` is less than `a`, stdin contains n-1 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If t is even, t is an integer between 0 and 49. Otherwise, t is an integer between 1 and 50. The current value of `t2` is a multiple of 15.**
