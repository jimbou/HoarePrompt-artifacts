The code prints the value of `t`, which is an integer that depends on the values of `t1` and `a`.

If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` is an integer between 0 and 50.

If `t1` is less than `a`, then if `t2` is a multiple of 15, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 if `t` is odd, otherwise `t` is an integer between 0 and 49. Otherwise, `t` is an integer between 2 and 100.

Since the exact values of `t1`, `a`, and `t2` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `t`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `t`.

Output: **t (where t is an integer between 0 and 50, or 1 and 50, or 0 and 49, or 2 and 100, depending on the values of t1, a, and t2)**
