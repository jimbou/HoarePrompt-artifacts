The function reads a series of pairs of integers from standard input, applies a transformation to the second integer of each pair based on its parity, and then adjusts the result based on the difference between the first integer and the transformed second integer. The function prints the adjusted result for each pair. The function processes all input pairs and leaves the standard input empty.
