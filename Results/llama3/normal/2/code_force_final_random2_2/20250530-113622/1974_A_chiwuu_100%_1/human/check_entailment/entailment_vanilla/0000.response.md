Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of screens needed to place application icons on a desktop. The desktop consists of screens with a grid size of 5x3, and there are two types of icons: 1x1 and 2x2.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases (n) and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 icons (a) and 2x2 icons (b).
3. It calculates the minimum number of screens needed to accommodate the 2x2 icons. If the number of 2x2 icons is even, it calculates the number of screens as b // 2. If the number of 2x2 icons is odd, it calculates the number of screens as b // 2 + 1. This is because each screen can accommodate 4 2x2 icons, and if there's an odd number of 2x2 icons, an additional screen is needed to accommodate the remaining icon.
4. It calculates the remaining space on the screens allocated for 2x2 icons. This is done by multiplying the number of screens allocated for 2x2 icons (t) by 15 (the total number of cells on a screen) and subtracting the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons (b * 4).
5. If the remaining space is sufficient to accommodate the 1x1 icons, the program uses the current number of screens (t). Otherwise, it calculates the additional number of screens needed to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons. This is done by dividing the remaining number of 1x1 icons (a - t1) by 15 and rounding up to the nearest integer using the ceiling function (// 15 + 1).
6. The program prints the total number of screens needed, which is the sum of the screens allocated for 2x2 icons and the additional screens needed for 1x1 icons.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
