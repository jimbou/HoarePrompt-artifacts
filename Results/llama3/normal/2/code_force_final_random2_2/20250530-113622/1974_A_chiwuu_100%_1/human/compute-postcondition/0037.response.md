Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer between -198 and 375, `t` is an integer between 0 and 49, stdin contains n-5 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated to be half of its original value, which is now between 0 and 49. The value of `t1` has also been updated accordingly, as it is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`. The other variables remain unchanged.
