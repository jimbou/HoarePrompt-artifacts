Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is 0 3, the program outputs 2, but the correct output should be 2. The issue is with the calculation of t1 and t2. The program assumes that the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons can be used to place the 1x1 icons, but this is not always the case. The program does not consider the actual available space on the screen.

A correct solution would be to calculate the total available space on the screen and then try to place the 2x2 icons and 1x1 icons in that space. The program should also consider the case where the number of 1x1 icons is more than the available space on the screen.

Here is a correct solution:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        total_space = 15
        screens = 0
        while b > 0:
            screens += 1
            total_space = 15
            total_space -= 4
            b -= 1
        while a > 0:
            if total_space >= a:
                break
            screens += 1
            total_space = 15
            a -= total_space
        if a > 0:
            screens += 1
        print(screens)
```

This solution first tries to place the 2x2 icons on the screen, and then tries to place the 1x1 icons in the remaining space. If there is not enough space on the screen to place all the 1x1 icons, it adds another screen.
