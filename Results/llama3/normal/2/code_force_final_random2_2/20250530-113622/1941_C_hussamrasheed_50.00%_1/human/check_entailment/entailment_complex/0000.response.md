Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in each string, removes these substrings from the string, and prints the total count of 'map' and 'pie' occurrences. The program also handles multiple test cases correctly.

The program's logic is sound. It first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the string and the string itself. It then counts the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the string, removes these substrings from the string, and prints the total count. This is exactly what the problem requires.

The program also handles edge cases correctly. For example, if the string does not contain 'map' or 'pie', the program will correctly print 0.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
