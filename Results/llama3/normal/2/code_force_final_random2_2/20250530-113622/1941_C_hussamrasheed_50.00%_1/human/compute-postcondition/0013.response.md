Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is t-1, n is an integer equal to the input integer, s is a string with all occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' removed, m is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original string, p is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the original string, and the sum of the number of occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the original string which is m + p is being printed**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `t-1`, indicating that the loop has run `t` times. The variables `n`, `s`, `m`, and `p` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop, which are the input integer, the string with all occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' removed, the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original string, and the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the original string, respectively. The sum of the number of occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the original string, which is `m + p`, will be printed as the output.
