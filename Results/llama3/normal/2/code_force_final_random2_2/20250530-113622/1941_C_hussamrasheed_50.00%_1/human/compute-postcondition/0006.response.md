Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the input integer, s is a string with all occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' removed, m is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original string, p is 0**

The code snippet first assigns the input integer to `n`, replacing its original value. Then, it assigns the input string to `s`, replacing its original value which had all occurrences of 'map' removed. The third line counts the occurrences of 'map' in the new string `s` and assigns it to `m`. The fourth line removes all occurrences of 'map' from `s`, making it a string with all occurrences of 'map' removed. The fifth line counts the occurrences of 'pie' in the new string `s` and assigns it to `p`. Since all occurrences of 'pie' were removed along with 'map', `p` becomes 0. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
