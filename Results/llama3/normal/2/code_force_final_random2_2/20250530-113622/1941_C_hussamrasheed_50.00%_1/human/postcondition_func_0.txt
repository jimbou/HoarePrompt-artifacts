This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a string s. It then counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in each string, removes these substrings from the string, and prints the total count of 'map' and 'pie' occurrences. The function processes multiple test cases, with the number of test cases specified by an initial integer t.
