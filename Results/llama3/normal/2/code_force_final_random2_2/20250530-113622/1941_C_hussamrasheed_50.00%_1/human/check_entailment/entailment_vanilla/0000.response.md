Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a given string to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

2. The provided Python program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.

3. The program then counts the occurrences of the substring "map" in the string `s` using the `count()` method and stores the count in the variable `m`.

4. It then replaces all occurrences of "map" in the string `s` with an empty string using the `replace()` method, effectively removing "map" from the string.

5. After removing "map", the program counts the occurrences of the substring "pie" in the modified string `s` using the `count()` method and stores the count in the variable `p`.

6. Finally, the program prints the sum of `m` and `p`, which represents the total number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

7. The program correctly handles the case where the string is already beautiful by printing 0, as the sum of `m` and `p` would be 0 in such cases.

8. The program also correctly handles the case where the string contains multiple occurrences of "map" and "pie" by counting and removing all occurrences.

9. The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the length of the string, as the `count()` and `replace()` methods have a linear time complexity.

10. The space complexity of the program is O(n), as the program creates a modified copy of the string `s` after removing "map".

Correctness: **True**
