Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 0, n is an integer, s is a string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, m is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original string, p is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the string after removing 'map'.**

The code first reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. Then, it reads a string from stdin and assigns it to `s`. The third line counts the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s` and assigns it to `m`. The fourth line removes all occurrences of 'map' from `s` and assigns the result back to `s`. Finally, the fifth line counts the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the modified string `s` and assigns it to `p`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged throughout the execution of the code.
