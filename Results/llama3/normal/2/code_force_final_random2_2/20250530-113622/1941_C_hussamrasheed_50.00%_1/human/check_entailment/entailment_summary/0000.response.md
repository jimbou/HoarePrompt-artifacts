Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in each string, removes these substrings from the string, and prints the total count of 'map' and 'pie' occurrences. The program processes multiple test cases, with the number of test cases specified by an initial integer t.

The program's logic is sound. It first reads the number of test cases t, then for each test case, it reads the length of the string n and the string s itself. It then counts the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the string, removes these substrings from the string, and prints the total count.

The program handles the case where the string is already beautiful (i.e., does not contain 'map' or 'pie') by printing 0.

The program also handles the case where the string contains multiple occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' by counting and removing all occurrences.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing multiple test cases and printing the correct output for each case.

Correctness: **True**
