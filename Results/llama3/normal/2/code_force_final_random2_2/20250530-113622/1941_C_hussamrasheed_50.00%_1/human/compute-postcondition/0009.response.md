The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the input integer, `s` is a string with all occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' removed, `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original string, `p` is 0, and the sum of `m` and `p` which is equal to `m` is being printed**
