The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) first, followed by `t` test cases. After accepting `t`, the stdin now contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^6) followed by a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t` test cases, each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^6) followed by a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.**
