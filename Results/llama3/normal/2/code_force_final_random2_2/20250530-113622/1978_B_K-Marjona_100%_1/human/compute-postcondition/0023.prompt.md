Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). Each of the following t lines contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    k = min(n, b - a)
    if b <= a:
        print(a * n)
    else:
        print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n, a, b, and k are integers, k is the minimum of n and b-a, and stdin contains at least one line of input minus the first line that was read. If b is less than or equal to a, the product of a and n is printed. If b is larger than a, the value of the expression b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n, a, and b are integers, k is the minimum of n and b-a, stdin contains at least two lines of input minus the first two lines that were read. If b is less than or equal to a, the product of a and n is printed which is equal to a*n. If b is greater than a, the sum of the first k terms of the arithmetic sequence with first term a and common difference 1, and the remaining (n - k) terms of the sequence with first term a and common difference 1 is printed, where k is the minimum of n and b-a.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n, a, and b are integers, k is the minimum of n and b-a. If b is less than or equal to a, the program prints a*n. Otherwise, the program prints b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
