Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input values `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case.
2. It calculates the optimal value of `k` as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. This is correct because `k` cannot be more than `n` (the number of buns) and `b - a` (the difference between the modified price and the usual price).
3. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it means that the modified price is not beneficial, so the program simply prints the total profit as `a * n`, which is correct.
4. If `b` is greater than `a`, the program calculates the total profit using the formula `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`. This formula is correct because:
	* `b * k` represents the total profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price.
	* `k * (k - 1) // 2` represents the total discount given to the first `k` buns, which is subtracted from the total profit.
	* `(n - k) * a` represents the total profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price.
5. The program correctly handles the case where `k` is 0, in which case the total profit is simply `a * n`.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit that Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns.

Correctness: **True**
