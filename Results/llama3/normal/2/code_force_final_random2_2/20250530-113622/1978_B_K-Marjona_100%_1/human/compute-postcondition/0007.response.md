Output: **n is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, k is an integer equal to the minimum of n and b-a, stdin contains at least one line of input minus the first line that was read, and b is larger than a, and this is printed: b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a, which is the value of the expression b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a where k is the minimum of n and b-a, b is larger than a, and n, a, b, and k are integers**
