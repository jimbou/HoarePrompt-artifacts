Output: **n, a, and b are integers, k is the minimum of n and b-a, stdin contains at least two lines of input minus the first two lines that were read, and this is printed: the value of the expression b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a, which is the sum of the first k terms of the arithmetic sequence with first term a and common difference 1, and the remaining (n - k) terms of the sequence with first term a and common difference 1, where k is the minimum of n and b-a**
