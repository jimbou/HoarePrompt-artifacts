Postcondition: ***n, a, b, and k are integers, k is the minimum of n and b-a, and stdin contains at least one line of input minus the first line that was read. If b is less than or equal to a, the product of a and n is printed. If b is larger than a, the value of the expression b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a is printed.***
