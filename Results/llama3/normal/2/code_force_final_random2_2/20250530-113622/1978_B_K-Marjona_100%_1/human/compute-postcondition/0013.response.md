The code prints the result of a mathematical expression involving the variables `b`, `k`, `n`, and `a`. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the expression:

1. `b * k`: This term multiplies the value of `b` by the value of `k`. Since `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b-a`, its value depends on the relationship between `n` and `b-a`.

2. `k * (k - 1) // 2`: This term calculates the sum of the first `k-1` integers. The `//` operator performs integer division, which means any fractional part of the result is discarded.

3. `(n - k) * a`: This term multiplies the difference between `n` and `k` by the value of `a`.

The overall expression is the sum of these three terms.

Output: **b times the minimum of n and b-a, minus the sum of the first k-1 integers, plus the product of the difference between n and the minimum of n and b-a, and a (where b, n, a are the values of the variables b, n, a respectively)**
