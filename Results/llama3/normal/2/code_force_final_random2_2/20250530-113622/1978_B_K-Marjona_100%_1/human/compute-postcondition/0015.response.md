Postcondition: ***n, a, and b are integers, k is the minimum of n and b-a, stdin contains at least two lines of input minus the first two lines that were read. If b is less than or equal to a, the product of a and n is printed which is equal to a*n. If b is greater than a, the sum of the first k terms of the arithmetic sequence with first term a and common difference 1, and the remaining (n - k) terms of the sequence with first term a and common difference 1 is printed, where k is the minimum of n and b-a.***
