This function reads a series of input lines from standard input, where the first line contains an integer t, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers n, a, and b, and calculates the minimum cost by either multiplying a with n or using a formula involving a, b, and k (the minimum of n and b-a). It then prints the calculated cost for each test case. The function repeats this process for the number of test cases specified by the input t, producing a separate output for each case.
