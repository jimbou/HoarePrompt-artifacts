Postcondition: **nodes is a dictionary with n keys, where each key maps to a list containing all the other keys, edges is an empty list, empty is True, n is an integer greater than 1, t is an integer, start is an integer, i is n - 1, leaves is a deque containing all the keys in nodes that have a value of length 1, stdin is empty, moves is the result of func_1(nodes, start) and the current value of moves is not empty**
