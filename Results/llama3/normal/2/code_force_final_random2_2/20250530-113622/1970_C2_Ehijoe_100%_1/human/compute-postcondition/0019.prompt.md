Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: nodes is a dictionary with n keys, where each key maps to a list containing all the other keys, edges is an empty list, empty is True, n is an integer greater than 1, t is an integer, start is a node in the tree represented as an integer, i is n - 1, leaves is an empty deque, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for key in nodes:
    if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
        leaves.append(key)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`nodes` is a dictionary with `n` keys that must not be empty, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is an integer, `start` is a node in the tree represented as an integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `stdin` is empty. If the length of the value of `nodes[key]` is 1, then `leaves` is a deque containing the key. Otherwise, `leaves` remains an empty deque.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`nodes` is a dictionary with at least one key left to process, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is an integer, `start` is a node in the tree represented as an integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `stdin` is empty. If the length of the value of `nodes[key]` is 1, then `leaves` is a deque containing the key. Otherwise, `leaves` remains an empty deque.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`nodes` is a dictionary with at least one key left to process, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is an integer, `start` is a node in the tree represented as an integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `stdin` is empty. If the length of the value of `nodes[key]` is 1, then `leaves` is a deque containing the key. Otherwise, `leaves` remains an empty deque.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
