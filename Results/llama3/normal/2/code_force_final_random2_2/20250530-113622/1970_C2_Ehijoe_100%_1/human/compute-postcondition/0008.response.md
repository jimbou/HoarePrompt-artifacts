Output State: **nodes is a dictionary with n keys, where each key maps to a list containing all the other keys, edges is an empty list, empty is True, n is an integer greater than 1, t is an integer, start is a node in the tree represented as an integer, i is n - 1, leaves is an empty deque, stdin is empty**

In this output state, a new variable `leaves` has been introduced and is assigned an empty deque. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin is still empty.
