Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. The problem requires determining the winner of a game played on a tree, where the game starts at a given node and players alternate moves until no valid move is available. The program correctly implements this game by using a recursive function (func_1) to check if there is a node in the tree that is not equal to the parent node and if the result of a recursive function call is False for any of the child nodes. The main function (func_2) reads the input, constructs the tree, and calls func_1 to determine the winner.

The program correctly handles the base case of the recursion in func_1, where it returns False if the length of nodes at index start is equal to 1 and the first element of nodes at index start is equal to parent. It also correctly handles the recursive case, where it appends the opposite of the result of func_1(nodes, node, start) to the distances list if node is not equal to parent.

In func_2, the program correctly reads the input, constructs the tree, and calls func_1 to determine the winner. It also correctly prints the result, either 'Ron' or 'Hermione', based on the result of func_1.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
