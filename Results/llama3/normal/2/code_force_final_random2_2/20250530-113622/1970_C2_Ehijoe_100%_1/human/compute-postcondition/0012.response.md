Postcondition: ***`nodes` is a dictionary with `n` keys that must not be empty, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is an integer, `start` is a node in the tree represented as an integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `stdin` is empty. If the length of the value of `nodes[key]` is 1, then `leaves` is a deque containing the key. Otherwise, `leaves` remains an empty deque.***
