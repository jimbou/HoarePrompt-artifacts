To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1, and `n` should still be greater than 1.

State: **nodes is a dictionary with two keys: u and v, where u and v are integers, and each key maps to a list containing the other integer, edges is an empty list, empty is True, n is an integer greater than 1, t is an integer, start is a node in the tree represented as an integer, i is 1, stdin contains 1 less input: a space-separated list of integers**
