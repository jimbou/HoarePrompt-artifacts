Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is an integer between 0 and `n*(n-1)/2`, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2), t is an integer between 1 and 10^3 and t is greater than 0.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input from stdin. The range of `n` and `k` is specified based on the given constraints. The stdin now contains t-1 lines, as one line has been consumed by the input operation. The value of t is still between 1 and 10^3 and is greater than 0, as it was in the initial state.
