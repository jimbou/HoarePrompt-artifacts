To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head and how it changes from one iteration to the next.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. Here, `_` is a throwaway variable that doesn't affect the state, and `range(int(input()))` is the key part that determines when the loop will execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is 1, which means `int(input())` has already been executed once, consuming one line from `stdin`. For the loop to execute again, `int(input())` must be able to consume another line from `stdin`.

Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, and it's currently 1, it means there are still more lines to read from `stdin`. Specifically, there are `t-1` lines left to read.

For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1, so that `int(input())` can consume another line from `stdin`.

The other variables, `n` and `k`, are not directly related to the loop head, so their values don't affect whether the loop will execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is an integer between 0 and `n*(n-1)/2`, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2), t is an integer between 2 and 10^3**
