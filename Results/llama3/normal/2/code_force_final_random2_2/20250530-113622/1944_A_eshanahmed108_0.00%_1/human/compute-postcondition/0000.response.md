To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`. The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` is greater than 0.

State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2), t must be greater than 0**
