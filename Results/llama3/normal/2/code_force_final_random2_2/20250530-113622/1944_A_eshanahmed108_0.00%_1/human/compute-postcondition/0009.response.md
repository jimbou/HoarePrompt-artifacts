Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is an integer between 0 and `n*(n-1)/2`, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2), t is an integer between 2 and 10^3**

The code reads two integers from the input, which are assigned to `n` and `k`, respectively. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to be between 1 and 100, and between 0 and `n*(n-1)/2`, respectively. The stdin now contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k, as one line has been read. The value of t remains unchanged, still between 2 and 10^3.
