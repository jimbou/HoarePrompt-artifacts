The code prints the value of `n` if the difference between `n` and `k` is less than or equal to 1, otherwise it prints 1. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `k` is an integer between 0 and `n*(n-1)/2`, the difference between `n` and `k` can be at most `n-1`. Therefore, the condition `n - k <= 1` is equivalent to `k >= n-1`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`, then `n` is printed, otherwise 1 is printed.
Output: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is an integer between 0 and `n*(n-1)/2`, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2), t is an integer between 1 and 10^3 and t is 1, and this is printed: n if k is greater than or equal to n-1, otherwise 1**
