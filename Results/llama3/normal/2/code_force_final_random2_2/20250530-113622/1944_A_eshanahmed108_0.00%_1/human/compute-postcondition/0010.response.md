The code prints the value of `n` if the difference between `n` and `k` is less than or equal to 1, otherwise it prints 1. Here, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `k` is an integer between 0 and `n*(n-1)/2`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of the expression `n - k`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either the value of `n` or 1.

Output: **n if n-k <= 1, otherwise 1 (where n is an integer between 1 and 100, and k is an integer between 0 and n*(n-1)/2)**
