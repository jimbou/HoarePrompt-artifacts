Output: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is an integer between 0 and `n*(n-1)/2`, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2), t is an integer between 2 and 10^3, and this is printed: the value of `n` if the difference between `n` and `k` is less than or equal to 1, otherwise 1**
