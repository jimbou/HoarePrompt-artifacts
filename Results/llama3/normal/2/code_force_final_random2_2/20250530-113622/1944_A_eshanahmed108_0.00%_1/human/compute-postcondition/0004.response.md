The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t` from the input, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decreased by 1. Also, stdin contains t-1 lines, so for the loop to execute again stdin must contain t-2 lines.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is an integer between 0 and `n*(n-1)/2`, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2), t is an integer between 1 and 10^3 and t is 1**
