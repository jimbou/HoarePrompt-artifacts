Output State: **the value of `n` if the difference between `n` and `k` is less than or equal to 1, otherwise 1, is printed t times.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the program will print the value of `n` if the difference between `n` and `k` is less than or equal to 1, otherwise it will print 1, for each of the `t` input pairs of `n` and `k`.
