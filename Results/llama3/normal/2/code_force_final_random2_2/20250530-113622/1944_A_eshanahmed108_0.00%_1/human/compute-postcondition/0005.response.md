Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is an integer between 0 and `n*(n-1)/2`, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2), t is an integer between 1 and 10^3 and t is 1**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` have been updated to the new values read from the input, which are integers between 1 and 100 and between 0 and `n*(n-1)/2`, respectively. The stdin now contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k, since one line has been read. The value of t remains the same, which is 1.
