The code prints the value of `n` if the difference between `n` and `k` is less than or equal to 1, otherwise it prints 1.
Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `k` is an integer between 0 and `n*(n-1)/2`, the difference between `n` and `k` can be either less than or equal to 1 or greater than 1.
If the difference is less than or equal to 1, the code prints the value of `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 100.
If the difference is greater than 1, the code prints 1.
Output: **n (if n - k <= 1), otherwise 1**
