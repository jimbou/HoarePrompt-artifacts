The code prints the value of `n` if the difference between `n` and `k` is less than or equal to 1, otherwise it prints 1. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `k` is an integer between 0 and `n*(n-1)/2`, the difference between `n` and `k` will always be less than or equal to 1 when `k` is 0 or `n-1`. In all other cases, the difference will be greater than 1.

Output: **1 or n (where n is an integer between 1 and 100)**
