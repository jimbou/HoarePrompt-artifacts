The code prints the value of `num`, which is calculated as `min(less) - max(big) - count`. 

Here, `min(less)` is the smallest integer in the `less` list, `max(big)` is the largest integer in the `big` list, and `count` is not defined in the initial state. However, based on the structure of the problem, it seems that `count` is likely an integer value that is being used in the calculation.

Since the exact values of `less`, `big`, and `count` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `num`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `num`.

Output: **num (where num is min(less) - max(big) - count)**
