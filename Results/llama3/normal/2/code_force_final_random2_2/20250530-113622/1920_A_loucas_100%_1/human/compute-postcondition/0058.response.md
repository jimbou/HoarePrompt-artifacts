Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 1, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` contains the integer `a`, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an integer not equal to 1 and not equal to 2, `a` is an integer, `num` is 0, `stdin` contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables maintain their initial values except for the list `no`, which now contains the integer value of `a`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains no input.
