Postcondition: ***`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer at least 1, `iterable2` is at least 0, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is undefined, stdin contains no input. If `x` is 1, then `big` contains one integer which is `a`. If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `no` and `big` are empty lists. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing one integer `a` and `less` and `big` are empty lists.***
