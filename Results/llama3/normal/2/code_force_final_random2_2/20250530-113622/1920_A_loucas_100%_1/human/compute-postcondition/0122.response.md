Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop` - 1, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is undefined, stdin contains no input. If `x` is 1, then `big` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers: `a` (at least `innerLoop` times). If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers: `a` (at least `innerLoop` times). If `x` is not 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers: `a` (at least `innerLoop` times).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

*   The value of `loop` remains an integer between 2 and 100.
*   The value of `iterable` remains 2.
*   The value of `innerLoop` remains an integer.
*   The value of `iterable2` is `innerLoop` - 1.
*   The value of `num` remains 0.
*   The value of `x` remains an integer.
*   The value of `a` remains an integer.
*   The value of `i` remains undefined.
*   The stdin remains empty.

The lists `big`, `less`, and `no` are populated based on the value of `x`. If `x` is 1, `big` contains `innerLoop` integers, all of which are `a`. If `x` is 2, `less` contains `innerLoop` integers, all of which are `a`. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` contains `innerLoop` integers, all of which are `a`.
