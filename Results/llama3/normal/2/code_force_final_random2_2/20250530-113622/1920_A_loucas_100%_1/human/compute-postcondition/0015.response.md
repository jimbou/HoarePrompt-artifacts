Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, if `x` is equal to 1, then `big` is a list containing one integer and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is equal to 2, then `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing one integer and `less` and `big` are empty lists.**

In this output state, the values of `loop`, `iterable`, `num`, `innerLoop`, and `iterable2` remain unchanged. The value of `x` is now an integer, and the value of `a` is also an integer. The lists `big`, `less`, and `no` are updated based on the value of `x`. If `x` is 1, `big` contains one integer, and `less` and `no` are empty. If `x` is 2, `less` contains one integer `a`, and `big` and `no` are empty. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `no` contains one integer, and `less` and `big` are empty.
