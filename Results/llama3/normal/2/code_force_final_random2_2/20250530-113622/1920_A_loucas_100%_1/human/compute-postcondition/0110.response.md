Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer at least 2, `iterable2` is at least 1, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is undefined, `big` is a list containing the integer `a`, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `loop`, `iterable`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, `num`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `x` and `a` are still integers, but their specific values are not specified. The list `big` now contains the integer `a`, which was appended to it by the code. The stdin remains empty, containing no input.
