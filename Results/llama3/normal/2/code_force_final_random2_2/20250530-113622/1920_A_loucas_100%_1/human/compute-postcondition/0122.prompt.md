Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: loop is an integer between 2 and 100, iterable is 2, innerLoop is an integer from stdin, iterable2 is innerLoop - 1, num is 0, x is an integer, a is an integer, stdin contains no input, no is an empty list, i is undefined, less is an empty list, big is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer at least 1, `iterable2` is at least 0, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is undefined, stdin contains no input. If `x` is 1, then `big` contains one integer which is `a`. If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `no` and `big` are empty lists. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing one integer `a` and `less` and `big` are empty lists.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer at least 2, `iterable2` is at least 1, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is undefined, stdin contains no input. If `x` is 1, then `big` is a list containing the integer `a`. If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing the integer `a`. If `x` is not 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing the integer `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer at least 2, `iterable2` is 2, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is undefined, stdin contains no input. If `x` is 1, then `big` is a list containing at least two integers: `a` (at least two times). If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing the integer `a`. If `x` is not 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing the integer `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
