Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: loop is an integer between 2 and 100, iterable is 0, less is an empty list, big is an empty list, no is an empty list, num is 0, innerLoop is an integer
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable2` is 0, `a` is an integer, stdin contains one input: a space-separated list of integers. If `x` is equal to 1, then `big` is a list containing one integer and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is equal to 2, then `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing one integer and `less` and `big` are empty lists.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer. If `x` is equal to 1, then `big` is a list containing two integers and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is equal to 2, then `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing one integer and `less` and `big` are empty lists. If `x` is equal to 1, then `big` is a list containing one integer and `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `no` is a list containing one integer `a`. If `x` is equal to 2, then `less` is a list containing two integers `a` and `big` is a list containing one integer and `no` is empty. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing two integers and `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `big` is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 3, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `x` and `a` are the two integers from the input, stdin contains no input. If `x` is equal to 1, then `big` is a list containing three integers and `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `no` is a list containing one integer `a`. If `x` is equal to 2, then `less` is a list containing three integers `a` and `big` is a list containing one integer and `no` is empty. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing one integer and `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `big` is a list containing one integer.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
