Output: ** `loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop` - 1, `num` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input. If `x` is 1, then `less` is either an empty list or a list containing one or more integers `a`, `big` is a list containing either one or more integers `a`, and `no` is either an empty list or a list containing the integer `a`. If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing either one or more integers `a`, and `big` and `no` are either empty lists or a list containing the integer `a`. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, then `less` contains either one or more integers `a`, and `big` contains one or more integers `a`, and `no` contains the integer `a`. The current value of `num` is less than 1, which means the minimum value in `less` minus the maximum value in `big` plus 1 is less than 1, and the number 0 is being printed**
