To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `no`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is not the last element in the list `no`. Since `i` is currently the first element in `no`, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be the next element in `no`.

State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop` - 1, `num` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input, `no` is a list containing at least two integers, `i` is the second element in `no`.**
