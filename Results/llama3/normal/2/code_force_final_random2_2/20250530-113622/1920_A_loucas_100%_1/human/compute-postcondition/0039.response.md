The only object in the loop head is variable `i` and list `no`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `no`. If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `no` has at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the `i` is the second element in the list.
State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 0, `less` is a list containing between 0 and `innerLoop` integers, `big` is a list containing between 0 and `innerLoop` integers, `no` is a list containing at least 2 integers, `num` is `min(less) - max(big)`, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is the second element in the list `no`.**
