Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop` - 1, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input. If `x` is 1, then `less` is either an empty list or a list containing one or more integers `a`, `big` is a list containing either one or more integers `a`, and `no` is either an empty list or a list containing the integer `a`. If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing either one or more integers `a`, and `big` and `no` are either empty lists or a list containing the integer `a`. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, then `less` contains either one or more integers `a`, and `big` contains one or more integers `a`, and `no` contains the integer `a`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same structure as the initial state, but with the following changes:

*   `iterable2` will be equal to `innerLoop` - 1.
*   The lists `less`, `big`, and `no` will contain either zero or more integers `a`, depending on the values of `x` and `a` in each iteration.
*   The values of `x` and `a` will be the last values read from the input.
*   The input `stdin` will be empty.
*   The other variables (`loop`, `iterable`, `innerLoop`, and `num`) will remain unchanged.
