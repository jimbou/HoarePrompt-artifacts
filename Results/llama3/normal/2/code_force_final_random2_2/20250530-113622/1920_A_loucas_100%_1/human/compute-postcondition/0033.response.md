Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 0, `less` is a list containing between 0 and `innerLoop` integers, `big` is a list containing between 0 and `innerLoop` integers, `no` is a list containing between 0 and `innerLoop` integers, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1` and its current value is less than 1, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration, due to the `continue` statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
