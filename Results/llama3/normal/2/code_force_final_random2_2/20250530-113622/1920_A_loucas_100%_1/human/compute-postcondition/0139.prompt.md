Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop` - 1, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is undefined, stdin contains no input. If `x` is 1, then `big` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers: `a` (at least `innerLoop` times). If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers: `a` (at least `innerLoop` times). If `x` is not 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers: `a` (at least `innerLoop` times). If `num` is less than 1, the current iteration of the most internal loop or if statement is skipped. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statement.
Code of the loop:
for i in no:
    if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
        num -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop` - 1, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `x` is not 1 or 2, `a` is an integer, `no` is a list containing at least one integer: `a` (at least once), stdin contains no input. If the first element `i` in `no` is within the range of `min(less)` and `max(big)`, then `i` is within this range. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop` - 1, `num` is `min(less) - max(big)`, `x` is not 1 or 2, `a` is an integer, `no` is a list containing at least two integers: `a` (at least once). If the second element `i` in `no` is within the range of `min(less)` and `max(big)`, then `i` is within this range. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop` - 1, `x` is not 1 or 2, `a` is an integer, `no` is a list containing at least three integers: `a` (at least once). If the third element `i` in `no` is within the range of `min(less)` and `max(big)`, then `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - 1` and `i` is within this range. Otherwise, `num` is `min(less) - max(big)` and no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
