To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `iterable2` and `innerLoop`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `innerLoop`. If `iterable2` is less than `innerLoop`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `iterable2` is 1 and `innerLoop` is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `iterable2` needs to be incremented by 1, so it becomes 2, and `innerLoop` must be greater than 2.

State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` must be greater than 2, `iterable2` is 2, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input. If `x` is 1, then `less` is either an empty list or a list containing one integer `a`, `big` is a list containing either one or two integers `a`, and `no` is either an empty list or a list containing the integer `a`. If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing either one or two integers `a`, and `big` and `no` are either empty lists or a list containing the integer `a`. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, then `less` contains the integer `a`, and `big` and `no` contains the integer `a`.**
