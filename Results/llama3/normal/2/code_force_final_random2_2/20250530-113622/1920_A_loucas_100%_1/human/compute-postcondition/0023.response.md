Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 3, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `x` and `a` are the two integers from the input, stdin contains no input, If `x` is equal to 1, then `big` is a list containing three integers and `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `no` is a list containing one integer `a`. If `x` is equal to 2, then `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `big` is a list containing one integer and `no` is empty. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing one integer and `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `big` is a list containing one integer.**

In this output state, the value of `big` has been updated to include the value of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for the lists `big`, `less`, and `no` have been updated based on the value of `x`.
