Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop` - 1, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is undefined, stdin contains no input. If `x` is 1, then `big` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers: `a` (at least `innerLoop` times). If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers: `a` (at least `innerLoop` times). If `x` is not 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers: `a` (at least `innerLoop` times). The current value of `num` is less than 1, and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement due to the `continue` statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `x` and the lists `big`, `less`, and `no` still hold.
