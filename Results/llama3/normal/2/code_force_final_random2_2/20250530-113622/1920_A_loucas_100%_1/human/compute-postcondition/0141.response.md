Output: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop` - 1, `x` is not 1 or 2, `a` is an integer, `no` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers: `a` (at least `innerLoop` times), `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - innerLoop + 1` if all elements `i` in `no` are within the range of `min(less)` and `max(big)`, otherwise `num` is `min(less) - max(big)` if no elements `i` in `no` are within the range of `min(less)` and `max(big)`, otherwise `num` is between `min(less) - max(big) - innerLoop + 1` and `min(less) - max(big)` (inclusive), stdin contains no input, and `num` is printed**
