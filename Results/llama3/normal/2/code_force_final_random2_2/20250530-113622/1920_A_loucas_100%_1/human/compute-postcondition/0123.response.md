Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop` - 1, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is undefined, stdin contains no input. If `x` is 1, then `big` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers: `a` (at least `innerLoop` times). If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers: `a` (at least `innerLoop` times). If `x` is not 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers: `a` (at least `innerLoop` times).**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to be the result of the expression `min(less) - max(big) + 1`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. Note that the value of `num` depends on the values of `less` and `big`, which in turn depend on the value of `x`. If `x` is 1, then `big` is a list of `a`s, and if `x` is 2, then `less` is a list of `a`s. If `x` is not 1 or 2, then `no` is a list of `a`s. The value of `num` is calculated based on the minimum value in `less` and the maximum value in `big`, and then adding 1 to the result.
