Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer at least 2, `iterable2` is 2, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is undefined, stdin contains no input. If `x` is 1, then `big` is a list containing at least two integers: `a` (at least two times). If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing the integer `a`. If `x` is not 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing the integer `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `big` has been updated to include at least two occurrences of the integer `a` when `x` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
