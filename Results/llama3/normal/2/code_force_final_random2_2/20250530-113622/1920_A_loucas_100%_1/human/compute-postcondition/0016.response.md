Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, if `x` is equal to 1, then `big` is a list containing two integers and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is equal to 2, then `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing one integer and `less` and `big` are empty lists.**

In this output state, the value of `big` has been updated to include the integer `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `x` being equal to 1, 2, or neither still hold, but now `big` contains two integers when `x` is 1.
