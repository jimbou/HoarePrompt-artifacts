Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer at least 1, `iterable2` is at least 0, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer equal to 2, `a` is an integer, `no` is an empty list, `i` is undefined, `less` is a list containing one integer `a`, `big` is an empty list, stdin contains no input**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `less` has been updated to include the integer value of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged, with `loop` still between 2 and 100, `iterable` still 2, `innerLoop` still at least 1, `iterable2` still at least 0, `num` still 0, `x` still 2, `a` still an integer, `no` still an empty list, `i` still undefined, `big` still an empty list, and stdin still contains no input.
