To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `iterable` and `loop`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `loop`. If `loop` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `loop` is already an integer between 2 and 100, it is guaranteed to be at least 1. Therefore, we only need to adjust the state of `iterable` to be 0, which is the initial value of the range.

State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing two integers a and x, `iterable` is 0**
