Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 3, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `x` and `a` are the two integers from the input, If `x` is equal to 1, then `big` is a list containing two integers and `less` is a list containing two integers `a` and `no` is a list containing one integer `a`. If `x` is equal to 2, then `less` is a list containing three integers `a` and `big` is a list containing one integer and `no` is empty. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing two integers and `less` is a list containing two integers `a` and `big` is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `loop`, `iterable`, `num`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, `x`, and `a` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is in the lists `less`, `big`, and `no`, which are updated based on the value of `x`. If `x` is 1, `less` now contains two integers `a`, and `big` contains two integers. If `x` is 2, `less` now contains three integers `a`, and `big` contains one integer. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `less` now contains two integers `a`, and `no` contains two integers.
