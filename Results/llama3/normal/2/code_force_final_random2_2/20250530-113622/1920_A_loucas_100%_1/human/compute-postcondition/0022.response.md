Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 3, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `x` and `a` are the two integers from the input, stdin contains no input, If `x` is equal to 1, then `big` is a list containing two integers and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is equal to 2, then `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing one integer and `less` and `big` are empty lists. If `x` is equal to 1, then `big` is a list containing one integer and `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `no` is a list containing one integer `a`. If `x` is equal to 2, then `less` is a list containing two integers `a` and `big` is a list containing one integer and `no` is empty. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing two integers and `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `big` is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `loop`, `iterable`, `num`, `innerLoop`, and `iterable2` remain unchanged. The values of `x` and `a` are updated to the two integers from the input. The stdin is now empty. The lists `big`, `less`, and `no` are updated based on the value of `x`.
