Postcondition: ***`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 0, `less` is a list containing between 0 and `innerLoop` integers, `big` is a list containing between 0 and `innerLoop` integers, `no` is a list containing at least 1 integer, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is the first element in the list `no`. The current value of `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`.***
