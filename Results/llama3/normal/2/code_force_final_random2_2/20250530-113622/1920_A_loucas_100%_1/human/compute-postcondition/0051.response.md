Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 1, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `num` is 0, `stdin` contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `x` and `a` are updated to be integers from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin now contains no input. The values of the other variables are not affected.
