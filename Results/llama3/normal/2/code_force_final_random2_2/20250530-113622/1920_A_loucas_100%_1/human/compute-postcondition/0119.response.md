Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer at least 2, `iterable2` is 2, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is undefined, `no` is a list containing the integer `a` (if `x` is not 1 or 2), stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `loop`, `iterable`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, `num`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. However, the list `no` is updated to contain the integer `a` only if `x` is not 1 or 2. If `x` is 1, the list `big` still contains the integer `a`, and if `x` is 2, the list `less` still contains the integer `a`. The stdin remains empty, containing no input.
