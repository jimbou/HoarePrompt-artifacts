Postcondition: ***`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable2` is 0, `a` is an integer, stdin contains one input: a space-separated list of integers. If `x` is equal to 2, then `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not equal to 2, then `no` is a list containing one integer and `less` and `big` are empty lists.***
