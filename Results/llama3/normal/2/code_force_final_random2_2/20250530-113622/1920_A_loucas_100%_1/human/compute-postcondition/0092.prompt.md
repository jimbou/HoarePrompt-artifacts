Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop` - 1, `num` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input. If `x` is 1, then `less` is either an empty list or a list containing one or more integers `a`, `big` is a list containing either one or more integers `a`, and `no` is either an empty list or a list containing the integer `a`. If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing either one or more integers `a`, and `big` and `no` are either empty lists or a list containing the integer `a`. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, then `less` contains either one or more integers `a`, and `big` contains one or more integers `a`, and `no` contains the integer `a`. `num` is equal to the minimum value in `less` minus the maximum value in `big` plus 1. If `num` is less than 1, the rest of the current iteration is skipped and the next iteration of the most internal loop is executed. Otherwise, the program continues with the rest of the current iteration.
Code of the loop:
for i in no:
    if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
        num -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop` - 1, `num` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input, `no` is a list containing the integer `a`, `i` is the first element in `no`. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value of `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value of `big`, then the current value of `i` satisfies this condition. Otherwise, no specific condition is met.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop` - 1, `num` is at least -1, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input, `no` is a list containing at least two integers, `i` is the second element in `no`. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum of `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum of `big`, then `num` is at least -1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop` - 1, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input, `no` is a list containing at least three integers, `i` is the third element in `no`. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum of `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum of `big`, then `num` is at least -2. Otherwise, `num` is at least -1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
