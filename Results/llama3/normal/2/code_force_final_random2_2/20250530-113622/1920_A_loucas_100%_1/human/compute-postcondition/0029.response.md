Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 0, `less` is a list containing between 0 and `innerLoop` integers, `big` is a list containing between 0 and `innerLoop` integers, `no` is a list containing between 0 and `innerLoop` integers, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `num` has been updated to be the difference between the smallest element in the `less` list and the largest element in the `big` list, plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
