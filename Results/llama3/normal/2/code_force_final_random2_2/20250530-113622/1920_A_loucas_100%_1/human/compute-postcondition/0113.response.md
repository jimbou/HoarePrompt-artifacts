Postcondition: ***`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer at least 2, `iterable2` is at least 1, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is undefined, stdin contains no input. If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing the integer `a`. Otherwise, `no` is a list containing the integer `a`.***
