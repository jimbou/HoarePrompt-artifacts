Postcondition: ***`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop` - 1, `num` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input. If `x` is 1, then `less` is either an empty list or a list containing one or more integers `a`, `big` is a list containing either one or more integers `a`, and `no` is either an empty list or a list containing the integer `a`. If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing either one or more integers `a`, and `big` and `no` are either empty lists or a list containing the integer `a`. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, then `less` contains either one or more integers `a`, and `big` contains one or more integers `a`, and `no` contains the integer `a`. `num` is equal to the minimum value in `less` minus the maximum value in `big` plus 1. If `num` is less than 1, the rest of the current iteration is skipped and the next iteration of the most internal loop is executed. Otherwise, the program continues with the rest of the current iteration.***
