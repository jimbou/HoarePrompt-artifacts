Postcondition: ***`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop` - 1, `num` is at least 1, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input, `no` is a list containing the integer `a`, `i` is the first element in `no`. The current value of `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value of `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value of `big`.***
