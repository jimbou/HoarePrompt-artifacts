Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing two integers a and x.
Code of the loop:
for iterable in range(loop):
    less = []
    big = []
    no = []
    num = 0
    innerLoop = int(input())
    for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
        x, a = map(int, input().split())
        if x == 1:
            big.append(a)
        elif x == 2:
            less.append(a)
        else:
            no.append(a)
    num = min(less) - max(big) + 1
    if num < 1:
        print(0)
        continue
    for i in no:
        if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
            num -= 1
    print(num)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 0, `less` is a list containing between 0 and `innerLoop` integers, `big` is a list containing between 0 and `innerLoop` integers, `no` is a list containing between 0 and `innerLoop` integers, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, and `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - count` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop` - 1, `num` is at least -len(no), `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input, `no` is a list containing at least len(no) integers, `i` is the last element in `no`. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum of `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum of `big`, then `num` is at least -len(no). Otherwise, `num` is at least -len(no) + 1, and the value of `num` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop` - 1, `x` is not 1 or 2, `a` is an integer, `no` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers: `a` (at least `innerLoop` times), `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - innerLoop + 1` if all elements `i` in `no` are within the range of `min(less)` and `max(big)`, otherwise `num` is `min(less) - max(big)` if no elements `i` in `no` are within the range of `min(less)` and `max(big)`, otherwise `num` is between `min(less) - max(big) - innerLoop + 1` and `min(less) - max(big)` (inclusive), stdin contains no input, and `num` is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
