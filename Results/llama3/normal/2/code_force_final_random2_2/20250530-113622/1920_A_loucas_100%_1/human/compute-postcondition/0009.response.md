Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 0, `less` is a list containing one integer `a`, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an integer equal to 2, `a` is an integer, stdin contains one input: a space-separated list of integers.**

The code appends the value of `a` to the list `less`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `less` now contains one integer `a`. The stdin still contains a space-separated list of integers as input.
