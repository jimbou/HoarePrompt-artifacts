Postcondition: ***`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop` - 1, `num` is `min(less) - max(big)`, `x` is not 1 or 2, `a` is an integer, `no` is a list containing at least two integers: `a` (at least once). If the second element `i` in `no` is within the range of `min(less)` and `max(big)`, then `i` is within this range. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
