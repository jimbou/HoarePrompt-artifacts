Postcondition: ***`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `num` is 0, `stdin` contains no input. If `x` is equal to 2, then `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not equal to 2, then `less` and `big` are empty lists and `no` contains the integer `a`.***
