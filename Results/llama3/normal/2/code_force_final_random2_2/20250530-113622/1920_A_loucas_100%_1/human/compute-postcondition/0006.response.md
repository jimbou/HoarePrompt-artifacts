Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is a list containing one integer, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable2` is 0, `a` is an integer, stdin contains one input: a space-separated list of integers. The current value of `x` is 1.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `big` now contains one integer, which is the value of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains a space-separated list of integers.
