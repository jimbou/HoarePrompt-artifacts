Output: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop` - 1, `num` is at least -len(no), `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input, `no` is a list containing at least len(no) integers, `i` is the last element in `no`. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum of `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum of `big`, then `num` is at least -len(no). Otherwise, `num` is at least -len(no) + 1, and the value of `num` is being printed**
