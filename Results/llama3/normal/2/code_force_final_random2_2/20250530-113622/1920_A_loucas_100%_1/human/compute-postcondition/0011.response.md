The code `no.append(a)` adds the value of `a` to the end of the list `no`. The value of `a` is an integer. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing one integer, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an integer not equal to 1 and not equal to 2, `a` is an integer, stdin contains one input: a space-separated list of integers**
