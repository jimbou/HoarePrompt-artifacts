The only objects in the loop head are variables  iterable2 and innerLoop, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the innerLoop.  If the innerLoop has at least 2 iterations the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, innerLoop has at least 2 iterations, iterable2 is at least 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the innerLoop must have at least 2 iterations and the iterable2 is 2.
State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer at least 2, `iterable2` is 2, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is undefined, stdin contains no input. If `x` is 1, then `big` is a list containing the integer `a`. If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing the integer `a`. If `x` is not 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing the integer `a`.**
