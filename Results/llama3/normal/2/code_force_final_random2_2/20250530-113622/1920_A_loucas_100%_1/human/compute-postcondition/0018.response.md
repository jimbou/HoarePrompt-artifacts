Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, if `x` is equal to 1, then `big` is a list containing one integer and `less` and `no` are lists where `no` contains one integer `a`. If `x` is equal to 2, then `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `big` and `no` are lists where `no` contains one integer `a`. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing two integers and `less` and `big` are empty lists.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `loop`, `iterable`, `num`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged. The list `no` now contains the integer `a` in all cases. If `x` is 1, `big` still contains one integer and `less` is empty. If `x` is 2, `less` still contains one integer `a` and `big` is empty. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `no` now contains two integers and `less` and `big` are empty.
