Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it initializes three lists: `less`, `big`, and `no`, to store the constraints of type 2, type 1, and type 3, respectively.

3. It then reads the number of constraints for the current test case and iterates over each constraint.

4. For each constraint, it checks the type of the constraint and appends the value to the corresponding list.

5. After reading all constraints, it calculates the range of possible values for `k` by subtracting the maximum value in `big` from the minimum value in `less` and adding 1. This is because `k` must be greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big` and less than or equal to the minimum value in `less`.

6. If the calculated range is less than 1, it means that there are no possible values for `k` that satisfy all constraints, so it prints 0 and continues to the next test case.

7. Otherwise, it iterates over the values in `no` and checks if each value is within the calculated range. If a value is within the range, it decrements the count of possible values for `k`.

8. Finally, it prints the count of possible values for `k`.

Correctness: **True**
