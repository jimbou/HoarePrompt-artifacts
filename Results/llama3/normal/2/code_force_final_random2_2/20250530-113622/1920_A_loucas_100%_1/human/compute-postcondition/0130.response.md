Postcondition: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop` - 1, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `x` is not 1 or 2, `a` is an integer, `no` is a list containing at least one integer: `a` (at least once), `i` is the first element in `no` and its current value is within the range of `min(less)` and `max(big)`, stdin contains no input.**
