The only objects in the loop head are variables  iterable2 and innerLoop, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the innerLoop.  If the innerLoop is at least 1 the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, iterable is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the innerLoop must be at least 1 and the iterable2 is 0.
State: **loop is an integer between 2 and 100, iterable is 0, less is an empty list, big is an empty list, no is an empty list, num is 0, innerLoop is at least 1, iterable2 is 0**
