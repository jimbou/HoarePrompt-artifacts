The only object in the loop head is variable  i and list no, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list no.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, no has at least 2 elements, i is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the i is the third element in the list.
State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop` - 1, `num` is at least -1, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input, `no` is a list containing at least three integers, `i` is the third element in `no`. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum of `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum of `big`, then `num` is at least -1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
