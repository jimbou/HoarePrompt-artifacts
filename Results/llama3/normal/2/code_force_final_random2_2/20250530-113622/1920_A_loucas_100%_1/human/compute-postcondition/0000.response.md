The code `loop = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `loop`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case starts with an integer n, the first integer in the input is assigned to `loop`. 

The value of `loop` is now an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), as specified in the initial state. The stdin now contains the remaining input for the test case, which includes n-1 lines, each containing two integers a and x.

Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing two integers a and x.**
