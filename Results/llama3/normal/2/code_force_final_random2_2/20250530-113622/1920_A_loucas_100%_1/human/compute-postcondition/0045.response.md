Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 0, `less` is a list containing between 0 and `innerLoop` integers, `big` is a list containing between 0 and `innerLoop` integers, `no` is a list containing between 0 and `innerLoop` integers, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - count`, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop variable `loop` remains an integer between 2 and 100, and the lists `less`, `big`, and `no` contain between 0 and `innerLoop` integers. The variable `num` is decreased by the count of elements in `no` that are less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`. The other variables `iterable`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged.
