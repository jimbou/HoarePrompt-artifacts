Postcondition: ***`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 3, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `x` and `a` are the two integers from the input. If `x` is equal to 2, then `less` is a list containing three integers `a` and `big` is a list containing one integer and `no` is empty. If `x` is not equal to 2, then the state of the lists `big`, `less` and `no` is the same as in the precondition. stdin contains no input.***
