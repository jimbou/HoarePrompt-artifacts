Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` must be greater than 1, `iterable2` is 1, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input. If `x` is 1, then `less` is an empty list, `big` is a list containing two integers `a`, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing one integer `a`, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, then `less` and `big` are empty lists and `no` contains the integer `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `big` has been updated to include the integer `a` when `x` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
