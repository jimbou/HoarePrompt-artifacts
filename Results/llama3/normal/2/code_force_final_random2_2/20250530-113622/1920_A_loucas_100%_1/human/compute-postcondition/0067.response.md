Postcondition: ***`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` must be greater than 1, `iterable2` is 1, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input. If `x` is 1, then `less` is either an empty list or a list containing one integer `a`, `big` is a list containing either one or two integers `a`, and `no` is either an empty list or a list containing the integer `a`. If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing either one or two integers `a`, and `big` and `no` are either empty lists or a list containing the integer `a`. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, then `less` contains the integer `a`, and `big` and `no` contains the integer `a`.***
