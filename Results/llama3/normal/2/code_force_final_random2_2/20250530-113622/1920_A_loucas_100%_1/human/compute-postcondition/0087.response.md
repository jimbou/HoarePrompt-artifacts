Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop` - 1, `num` is at least -1, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input, `no` is a list containing at least two integers, `i` is the second element in `no`.**

The value of `num` is decreased by 1. Since `num` was at least 0, it is now at least -1. The values of the other variables are not affected.
