Output: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop` - 1, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is undefined, stdin contains no input. If `x` is 1, then `big` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers: `a` (at least `innerLoop` times). If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers: `a` (at least `innerLoop` times). If `x` is not 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers: `a` (at least `innerLoop` times). The current value of `num` is less than 1, and the number 0 is being printed**
