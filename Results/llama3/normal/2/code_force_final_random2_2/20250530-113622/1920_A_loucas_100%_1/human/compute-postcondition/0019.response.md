Postcondition: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer. If `x` is equal to 1, then `big` is a list containing one integer and `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `no` is a list containing one integer `a`. If `x` is equal to 2, then `less` is a list containing two integers `a` and `big` is a list containing one integer and `no` is empty. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing two integers and `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `big` is empty.**
