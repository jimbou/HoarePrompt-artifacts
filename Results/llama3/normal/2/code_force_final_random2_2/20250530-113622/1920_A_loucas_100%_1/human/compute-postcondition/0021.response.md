The only objects in the loop head are variables  iterable2 and innerLoop, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the innerLoop.  If the innerLoop is at least 3 the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, innerLoop is at least 2, iterable2 is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the innerLoop must be at least 3 and the iterable2 is 2.
State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 3, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer. If `x` is equal to 1, then `big` is a list containing two integers and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is equal to 2, then `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing one integer and `less` and `big` are empty lists. If `x` is equal to 1, then `big` is a list containing one integer and `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `no` is a list containing one integer `a`. If `x` is equal to 2, then `less` is a list containing two integers `a` and `big` is a list containing one integer and `no` is empty. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing two integers and `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `big` is empty.**
