Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: loop is an integer between 2 and 100, iterable is 1, less is an empty list, big is an empty list, no is an empty list, innerLoop is an integer, iterable2 is innerLoop - 1, x is an integer, a is an integer, num is 0, stdin contains 1 less input: an integer
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `num` is 0, `stdin` contains no input. If `x` is 1, then `less` is an empty list, `big` is a list containing one integer `a`, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing one integer `a`, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, then `less` and `big` are empty lists and `no` contains the integer `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` must be greater than 1, `iterable2` is 1, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input. If `x` is 1, then `less` is either an empty list or a list containing one integer `a`, `big` is a list containing either one or two integers `a`, and `no` is either an empty list or a list containing the integer `a`. If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing either one or two integers `a`, and `big` and `no` are either empty lists or a list containing the integer `a`. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, then `less` contains the integer `a`, and `big` and `no` contains the integer `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` must be greater than 2, `iterable2` is 2, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input. If `x` is 1, then `less` is either an empty list or a list containing one or two integers `a`, `big` is a list containing either one, two or three integers `a`, and `no` is either an empty list or a list containing the integer `a`. If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing either one, two or three integers `a`, and `big` and `no` are either empty lists or a list containing the integer `a`. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, then `less` contains either one or two integers `a`, and `big` contains two integers `a`, and `no` contains the integer `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
