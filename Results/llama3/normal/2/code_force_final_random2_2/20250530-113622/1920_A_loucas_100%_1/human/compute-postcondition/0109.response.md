Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer at least 2, `iterable2` is at least 1, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is undefined, stdin contains no input. `x` and `a` are assigned the values from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The values of `loop`, `iterable`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, `num`, and `i` are not affected.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `loop`, `iterable`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, `num`, and `i` remain the same. The values of `x` and `a` are updated to the integers from the input. The stdin is now empty.
