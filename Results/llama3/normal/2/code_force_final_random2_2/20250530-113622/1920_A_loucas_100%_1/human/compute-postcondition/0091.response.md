Postcondition: ***`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop` - 1, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input, `no` is a list containing at least three integers, `i` is the third element in `no`. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum of `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum of `big`, then `num` is at least -2. Otherwise, `num` is at least -1.***
