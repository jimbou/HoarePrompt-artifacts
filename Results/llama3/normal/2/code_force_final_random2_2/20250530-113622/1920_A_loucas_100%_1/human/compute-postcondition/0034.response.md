Postcondition: ***`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100, `iterable` is 0, `less` is a list containing between 0 and `innerLoop` integers, `big` is a list containing between 0 and `innerLoop` integers, `no` is a list containing between 0 and `innerLoop` integers, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer. If `num` is less than 1, the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped and the program moves on to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statements.***
