Postcondition: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, x is greater than 1, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains no input, i is 0, num is equal to list0[1] - list0[0] - 1. If the current value of num is 1, then count is 1. Otherwise, count remains 0.**
