Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 2, `num` is the difference between the fourth and third elements of `list0` minus 1, and `count` is either 1 plus its previous value or 2, depending on the value of `num`. If `num` is 1, `count` is either 2 plus its previous value or 3, depending on the value of `num`.***
