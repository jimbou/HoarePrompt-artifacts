Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, where n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2*10^5), and y is 0. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, and stdin contains one less test case than before.**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `T` is assigned the value of the first input, which is a positive integer. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one less than before because we have already read the first test case. Each test case still consists of two lines, with the first line containing three integers: n, x, and y, where n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2*10^5), and y is 0. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.
