Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, x is greater than 2, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains no input, i is 2, num is equal to list0[3] - list0[2] - 1. If the current value of num is 1, then count is 3. Otherwise, count is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: T is still a positive integer greater than 0, _ is still 0, n is still an integer, x is still greater than 2, y is still an integer, list0 is still a sorted list of integers, stdin still contains no input, i is still 2, and num is still equal to list0[3] - list0[2] - 1. However, the value of count has changed. If num is 1, count is now 3. If num is not 1, count is now 2.
