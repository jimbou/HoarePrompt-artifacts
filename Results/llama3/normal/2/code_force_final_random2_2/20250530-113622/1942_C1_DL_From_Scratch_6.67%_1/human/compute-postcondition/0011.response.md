Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, x is greater than 2, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains no input, i is 1, num is equal to list0[2] - list0[1] - 1. If the current value of num is 1, then count is 2. Otherwise, count is 1.***
