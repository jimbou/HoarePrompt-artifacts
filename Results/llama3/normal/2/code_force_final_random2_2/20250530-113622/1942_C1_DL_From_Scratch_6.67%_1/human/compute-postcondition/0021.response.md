The code prints the sum of `count` and `x - 2`. Since `count` is either `x - 1` or `x - 2`, and `x` is a positive integer, the sum will be either `2x - 3` or `2x - 4`. However, if `num` is 1, then `count` is either `x - 1` or `x - 1`, which means the sum will be `2x - 3`. Otherwise, the sum will be either `2x - 3` or `2x - 4`.

Output: **2x - 3 or 2x - 4 (where x is a positive integer)**
