Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 2, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 2, `num` is the result of `list0[3] - list0[2] - 1`. If `num` is 1, then `count` is 3. Otherwise, `count` is 2.***
