Postcondition: **T is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 1, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, i is 0, and count is 1 if the difference between the second and first elements of list0 minus 1 equals 1. Otherwise, the values of T, _, n, x, y, list0, i, and count remain unchanged.**
