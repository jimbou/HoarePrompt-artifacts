Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, where n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2*10^5), and y is 0. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function then sorts the list of integers, counts the number of consecutive pairs of elements that have a difference of 2, and increments the count if the difference between n and the last element in the list is 1. Finally, it prints the count plus x minus 2 for each test case.**
