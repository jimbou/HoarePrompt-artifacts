Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, x is greater than 2, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains no input, i is 2, num is equal to list0[3] - list0[2] - 1. If the current value of num is 1, then count is 3. Otherwise, count is 2.***
