To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `T` and the loop variable `_`. Since the loop is a `for` loop with a range, the loop will execute if `T` is greater than 0. Also, the loop variable `_` will take on the values from 0 to `T-1` during each iteration.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0**
