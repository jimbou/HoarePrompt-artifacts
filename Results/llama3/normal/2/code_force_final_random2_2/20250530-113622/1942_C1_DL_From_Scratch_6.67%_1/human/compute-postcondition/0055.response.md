Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 1, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, i is 1, and num is the difference between the third and second elements of list0 minus 1. If num is 1, count is 2 if the difference between the second and first elements of list0 minus 1 equals 1, otherwise count is 1 plus its previous value. If num is not 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
