Postcondition: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, i is x - 1, and the current value of num is 1. Additionally, if n - list0[-1] is 1, then count is the number of times num is 1 in the loop. Otherwise, count is the number of times num is 1 in the loop minus 1.**
