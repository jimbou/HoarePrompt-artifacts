Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, i is x - 1, and num is n - list0[-1]. If num is 1, count is either the number of times num is 1 in the loop plus 1 if n - list0[-1] is 1, or the number of times num is 1 in the loop minus 1 plus 1 if n - list0[-1] is not 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
