Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, where n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2*10^5), and y is 0. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, and stdin contains one less test case than before.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    list0 = sorted(list0)
    count = 0
    for i in range(x - 1):
        num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
    num = n - list0[-1]
    if num == 1:
        count += 1
    print(count + x - 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, x is a positive integer, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains no input, i is x - 1, num is either 1 or not equal to 1, and count is either x - 1 or x - 2. If num is 1, then count is either x - 1 or x - 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and the sum of count and x - 2 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, i is x - 1, and num is n - list0[-1]. If num is 1, count is either the number of times num is 1 in the loop plus 1 if n - list0[-1] is 1, or the number of times num is 1 in the loop minus 1 plus 1 if n - list0[-1] is not 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and the sum of count and x minus 2 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: T is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, i is x - 1, and count is the number of consecutive pairs of elements in list0 that have a difference of 2. If n - list0[-1] is 1, then count is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made. , and this is printed: count + x - 2 (where count is the number of consecutive pairs of elements in list0 that have a difference of 2, and x is an integer)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
