Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers (1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9), stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two integers.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains the same, but the value of `i` is incremented by 1. The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values of the two integers from the first line of input. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two integers, as one line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
