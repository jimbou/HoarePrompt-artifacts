Based on the initial state, the code will print 'Alice' regardless of the values of `a` and `b` because the print statement is not conditional. The condition that determines whether 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed is not relevant in this case because the print statement is a simple statement that prints 'Alice' without any conditions.

Output: **Alice**
