Reasoning: 

The given program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. The key insight here is that the game's outcome depends on the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

The program uses the expression `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0` to check if the absolute difference is even. If it is, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This logic is correct because the game's rules imply that the player who can make the last move (i.e., remove the last coin) will win. By analyzing the possible moves and their outcomes, it can be shown that the player with the wallet having the smaller number of coins (in terms of parity) will ultimately make the last move and win the game.

The program's implementation is also correct, as it reads the input pairs, applies the logic, and prints the result for each pair.

Correctness: **True**
