To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `t` is not changed by the loop, its value remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `i` is 3, `a` and `b` are integers (1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9) and are the last two integers from the input, stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two integers. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, 'Bob' is printed. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd, 'Alice' is printed.**
