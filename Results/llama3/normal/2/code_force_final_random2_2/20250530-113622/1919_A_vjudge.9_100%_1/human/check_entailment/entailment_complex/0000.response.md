Reasoning:

The problem states that the game is won by the player who can make a valid move on their turn. A valid move involves choosing to exchange wallets with their opponent or keeping their current wallet, and then removing 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move, which means their wallet is empty.

The given program determines the winner based on the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. If the absolute difference is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

This solution is correct because the game can be analyzed as follows:

* If the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even, then Alice and Bob can alternate turns, with each player removing 1 coin from their wallet on each turn. Since the difference is even, they will eventually reach a state where both wallets have the same number of coins. At this point, Bob can make a valid move by keeping his wallet and removing 1 coin, while Alice cannot make a valid move because her wallet would be empty. Therefore, Bob wins.
* If the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is odd, then Alice and Bob can alternate turns, with each player removing 1 coin from their wallet on each turn. Since the difference is odd, they will eventually reach a state where one wallet has 1 coin and the other wallet has 0 coins. At this point, Alice can make a valid move by swapping wallets and removing 1 coin, while Bob cannot make a valid move because his wallet would be empty. Therefore, Alice wins.

The given program correctly implements this logic, printing "Bob" when the absolute difference is even and "Alice" when the absolute difference is odd.

Correctness: **True**
