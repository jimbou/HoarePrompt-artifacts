Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to determine who will win the game based on the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key insight is that the game is won by the player who can make the last move, which is determined by the parity of the difference between the number of coins in the two wallets.

The program uses the expression `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0` to check if the difference between the number of coins in the two wallets is even. If it is, then Bob will win, because Alice will be forced to make a move that will leave Bob with the last coin. If the difference is odd, then Alice will win, because she can make a move that will leave Bob with no coins.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where one or both of the wallets have only one coin. The examples provided in the problem description also demonstrate the correctness of the program.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is **True**.
