Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `i` is 3, `a` and `b` are integers (1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9) and are the last two integers from the input, stdin contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two integers. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, 'Bob' is printed. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd, 'Alice' is printed.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two integers, since one line has been read. The condition for printing 'Bob' or 'Alice' is still valid, but the specific values of `a` and `b` have changed.
