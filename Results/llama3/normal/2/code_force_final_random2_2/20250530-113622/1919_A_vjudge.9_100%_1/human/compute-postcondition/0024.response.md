Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is `t`, `a` and `b` are integers (1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9) and are the last two integers from the input, stdin is empty. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, 'Bob' is printed. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd, 'Alice' is printed, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed `t-1` times.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains the same, the value of `i` is equal to `t`, the values of `a` and `b` are the last two integers from the input, and the standard input is empty. The loop has printed either 'Alice' or 'Bob' `t` times, depending on the parity of the absolute difference between `a` and `b` in each iteration.
