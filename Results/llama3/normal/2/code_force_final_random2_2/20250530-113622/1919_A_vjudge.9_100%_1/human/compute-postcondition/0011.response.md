Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers (1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9) and are the last two integers from the input, stdin contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, 'Bob' is printed. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd, 'Alice' is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the last two integers from the input, which are within the range of 1 to 10^9. The stdin now contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers, as one line has been consumed by the input operation. The condition for printing 'Bob' or 'Alice' remains the same, based on the absolute difference between `a` and `b`.
