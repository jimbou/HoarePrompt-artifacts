Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `i` is 3, `a` and `b` are integers (1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9) and are the last two integers from the input, stdin contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two integers. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, 'Bob' is printed. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd, 'Alice' is printed, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed again.***
