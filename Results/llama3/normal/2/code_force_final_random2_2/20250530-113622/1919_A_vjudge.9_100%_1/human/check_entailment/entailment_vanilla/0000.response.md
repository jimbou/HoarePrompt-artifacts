Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

The provided program uses a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem. It calculates the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets and checks if it is even or odd. If the difference is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

The reasoning behind this approach is as follows:

* If the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even, it means that the number of coins in both wallets is either both even or both odd. In this case, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that he will not run out of coins before Alice does. Therefore, Bob wins.
* If the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is odd, it means that the number of coins in one wallet is even, and the number of coins in the other wallet is odd. In this case, Alice can always make a move that will leave Bob with an even number of coins, forcing him to make a move that will leave Alice with an odd number of coins. This process continues until Bob runs out of coins, at which point Alice wins.

The program correctly implements this logic, and the output matches the expected results for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
