Reasoning:

The problem can be solved by analyzing the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. If the absolute difference is even, Bob will win, and if it is odd, Alice will win.

The given program correctly implements this logic by using the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even (i.e., `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`). If it is even, the program prints 'Bob', and if it is odd, the program prints 'Alice'.

The program also correctly handles the input and output formats, reading the number of test cases `t` and the two integers `a` and `b` for each test case, and printing the result for each test case.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
