Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `t` lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the first line of input, which is between 1 and 1000. The stdin still contains `t` lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b`, where `a` and `b` are between 1 and 10^9.
