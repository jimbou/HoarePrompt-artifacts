Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `n` is 0, `ax` is the minimum of all x values when a is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all x values when a is 1, `cx` is a set containing all x values when a is 3 that must have at least 1 element, `r` is a list containing two integers where the first integer is the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive and the second integer is either 0 if bx is greater than or equal to ax, or the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive if bx is less than ax, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, `_` is n, `tmp` is 0, stdin contains 0 test cases, and `i` is the first element in the set `cx`. The current value of `i` is between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, and `bx` is less than `ax`.**
