Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, _ is an integer between 3 and 101 inclusive, n is an integer, cx is an empty set, ax is 1000000007, bx is -1, a is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, x is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, r is a list containing one integer which is the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive, stdin contains -1 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state can be described as follows:

After executing the code, the values of `t`, `_`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged. The value of `n` is updated to an integer value read from the input. The set `cx` is reset to an empty set. The values of `ax` and `bx` are updated to 1000000007 and -1, respectively. The list `r` is updated to contain a single integer, which is the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1, minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive. Since `cx` is empty, this difference is simply `ax - bx + 1`. The number of test cases in `stdin` is decremented by 1.
