The only object in the loop head is variable `i` and set `cx`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `cx`. If the set `cx` has at least two elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `cx` has at least two elements, `i` is one of the elements in `cx`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the set `cx` must have at least two elements and `i` is another element in `cx`.
State: **`tmp` is 1 or 2 if `i` is between `bx` and `ax` inclusive and `i` is an element in `cx`, otherwise `tmp` is 0 or 1. `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and all x values where a is 2, `bx` is the maximum of -1 and all x values where a is 1, `cx` is a set containing at least two x values where a is not 1 or 2, `r` is a list containing one integer which is the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive, stdin contains -n test cases, a is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, x is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, `i` is another element in `cx`.**
