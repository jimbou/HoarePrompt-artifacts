To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for _ in range(n):`. The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` needs to be decremented by 1.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `_` is 1
* `n` is greater than 0, but specifically, it is one less than its previous value.

The other variables (`t`, `ax`, `bx`, `x`, `r`, `cx`, `a`, and `stdin`) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise -1, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, `r` is a list containing one integer which is the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, stdin contains -2 test cases. If `a` is 1, `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is 2, `cx` is an empty set and `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `cx` is a set containing one integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive and `a` is an integer between 3 and 100 inclusive.**
