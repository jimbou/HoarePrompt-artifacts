To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, we can adjust its state to be at least 1. We can also adjust the state of `_` to be 0, as it is the loop variable.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1**
