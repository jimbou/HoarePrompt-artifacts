Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` is 2, `bx` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. In all other cases, `bx` is -1. `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `r`, `_`, and `n` remain unchanged. The value of `stdin` is updated to `t-3` test cases because one test case has been consumed by the `input()` function. The values of `cx` and `bx` are updated based on the new values of `a` and `x`, which are assigned the values from the input. The range of `a` and `x` is updated to reflect the possible values they can take based on the input.
