Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It correctly handles the three types of constraints:

1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x
2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x
3. k must be not equal to some integer x

The program initializes the minimum and maximum possible values of k (bx and ax) and a set to store the values that k cannot be equal to (cx). It then iterates through the constraints, updating bx and ax accordingly, and adding values to cx when a constraint of type 3 is encountered.

After processing all constraints, the program checks if bx is greater than or equal to ax, which would mean that there are no possible values of k that satisfy all constraints. If this is the case, it appends 0 to the result list. Otherwise, it calculates the number of possible values of k by subtracting bx from ax, adding 1, and then subtracting the number of values in cx that are within the range [bx, ax].

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. It also efficiently uses a set to store the values that k cannot be equal to, which allows it to quickly check if a value is in cx.
