Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer**.

In this output state, the values of `t`, `r`, `_`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, and `bx` remain unchanged. The `stdin` now contains `t-2` test cases because one test case has been read by the `input()` function. The new variables `a` and `x` are assigned integer values from the input, which are split by the `split()` function and converted to integers by the `map(int, ...)` function.
