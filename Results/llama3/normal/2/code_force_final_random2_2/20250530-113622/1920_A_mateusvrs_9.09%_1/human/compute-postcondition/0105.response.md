Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `n` is greater than 1, `ax` is either 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 depending on whether `a` is 2 or not, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise -1, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing one integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive depending on whether `a` is 2 or not, `r` is a list containing two integers where the first integer is the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive and the second integer is either 0 if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, or the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive if `bx` is less than `ax`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive and is assigned the value of the second integer from the input, `_` is 1, stdin contains `-n-2` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `ax`, `bx`, `cx`, `r`, and `_` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `a` is updated to the first integer from the input, and the value of `x` is updated to the second integer from the input. The number of test cases in stdin is decreased by 1.
