Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, _ is n, n is greater than or equal to 0, ax is the minimum of 1000000007 and all x values where a is 2, bx is the maximum of -1 and all x values where a is 1, cx is a set containing all x values where a is not 1 or 2, r is a list containing one integer which is the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive, stdin contains -n test cases, a is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, x is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The value of `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive.
- The value of `_` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times.
- The value of `n` is greater than or equal to 0, as it was before the loop started.
- The value of `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and all `x` values where `a` is 2. This means that `ax` will be the smallest value that `x` took when `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if `a` was never 2.
- The value of `bx` is the maximum of -1 and all `x` values where `a` is 1. This means that `bx` will be the largest value that `x` took when `a` was 1, or -1 if `a` was never 1.
- The value of `cx` is a set containing all `x` values where `a` is not 1 or 2. This means that `cx` will contain all the values of `x` that were not used to update `ax` or `bx`.
- The value of `r` is a list containing one integer which is the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive. This means that `r` will contain the count of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in `cx`.
- The value of `stdin` contains `-n` test cases, indicating that the loop has consumed `n` test cases.
- The values of `a` and `x` are still integers between 1 and 100 inclusive and between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, respectively, but their exact values are not specified as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
