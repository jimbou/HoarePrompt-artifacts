Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `cx` is a set containing one integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an integer between 3 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, `r` is a list containing one integer which is the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, stdin contains -2 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is still 0, `n` is still greater than 0, `cx` now contains one integer which is the value of `x` that is between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, `ax` is still 1000000007, `bx` is still -1, `a` is still an integer between 3 and 100 inclusive, `x` is still an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, `r` is still a list containing one integer which is the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, and stdin contains -2 test cases.
