Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 test cases, `_` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `n` is 0, `cx` is a set containing integers that must have at least 2 integers, `ax` is an integer between 1 and 1000000007 inclusive, `bx` is an integer between -1 and 1000000000 inclusive, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, `bx` is less than `ax`. If the second integer `i` in the set `cx` is between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, then `tmp` is 2. Otherwise, `tmp` is 1. `i` is the second integer in the set `cx`.***
