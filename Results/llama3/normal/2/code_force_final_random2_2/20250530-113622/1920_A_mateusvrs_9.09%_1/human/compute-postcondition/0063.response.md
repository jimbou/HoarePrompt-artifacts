Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise -1, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, `r` is a list containing one integer which is the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `cx` is a set containing one integer which is `x`, stdin contains -1 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still between 2 and 500 inclusive. The value of `_` is still 1. The value of `n` is still greater than 0. The value of `ax` is still 1000000007. The value of `bx` is still the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise -1. The value of `x` is still an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive. The value of `r` is still a list containing one integer which is the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive. The value of `a` is still an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. The set `cx` now contains one integer which is `x`. The stdin still contains -1 test cases.
