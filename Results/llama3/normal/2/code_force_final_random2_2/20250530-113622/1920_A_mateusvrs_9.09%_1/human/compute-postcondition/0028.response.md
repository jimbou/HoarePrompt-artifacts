Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 test cases, `_` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `n` is 0, `cx` is a set containing integers, `ax` is an integer between 1 and 1000000007 inclusive, `bx` is an integer between -1 and 1000000000 inclusive, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the following characteristics:

- `t` remains an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
- `r` remains an empty list.
- `stdin` will be empty, containing 0 test cases.
- `_` will be an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, representing the number of iterations of the loop.
- `n` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
- `cx` will be a set containing integers, which are the values of `x` when `a` is 3.
- `ax` will be an integer between 1 and 1000000007 inclusive, which is the minimum value of `x` when `a` is 2.
- `bx` will be an integer between -1 and 1000000000 inclusive, which is the maximum value of `x` when `a` is 1.
- `a` will be an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, representing the last value of `a` processed.
- `x` will be an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, representing the last value of `x` processed.
