Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, stdin contains -2 test cases. If `a` is 1, `ax` is either 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and either the previous value of `bx` or -1, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing one integer which is `x`, and `r` is a list containing one integer which is the difference between `ax` and either the previous value of `bx` or `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between either the previous value of `bx` and `ax` inclusive or `bx` and `ax` inclusive. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing one integer which is `x`, and `r` is a list containing one integer which is the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `ax` is either 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is either a set containing one integer which is `x` or a set containing two integers which are `x` and the previous value of `cx`, and `r` is a list containing one integer which is the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive.***
