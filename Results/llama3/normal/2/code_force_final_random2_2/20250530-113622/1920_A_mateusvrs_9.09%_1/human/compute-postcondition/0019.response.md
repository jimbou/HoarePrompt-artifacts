Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the integer `x` and possibly other integers. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` is 2, `bx` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. In all other cases, `bx` is -1. `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`.**
