Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 test cases, `_` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `n` is 0, `cx` is a set containing integers that must have at least 2 integers, `ax` is an integer between 1 and 1000000007 inclusive, `bx` is an integer between -1 and 1000000000 inclusive, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, `bx` is less than `ax`, and `tmp` is 2 if the second integer `i` in the set `cx` is between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, otherwise `tmp` is 1, `i` is the second integer in the set `cx`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `tmp` has been incremented by 1. If the second integer `i` in the set `cx` is between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, `tmp` is now 2, otherwise it is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
