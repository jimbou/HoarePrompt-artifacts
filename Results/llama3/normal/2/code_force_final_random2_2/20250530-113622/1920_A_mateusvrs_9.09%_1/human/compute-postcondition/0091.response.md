The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is not specified, but we can assume it is equal to the number of iterations that have been executed so far. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be less than `t`. Since `_` is not specified, we can assume it is equal to the number of iterations that have been executed so far, which is 1. So for the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and all x values where a is 2, `bx` is the maximum of -1 and all x values where a is 1, `cx` is a set containing all x values where a is not 1 or 2, `r` is a list containing two integers where the first integer is the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive and the second integer is either 0 if bx is greater than or equal to ax, or the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive if bx is less than ax, stdin contains -n test cases, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, `_` is 1**
