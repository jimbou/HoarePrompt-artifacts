Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `n` is 0, `ax` is the minimum of all x values when a is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all x values when a is 1, `cx` is a set containing all x values when a is 3 that must have at least 3 elements, `r` is a list containing two integers where the first integer is the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive and the second integer is either 0 if bx is greater than or equal to ax, or the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive if bx is less than ax, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, `_` is n, `tmp` is either 2 or 3, stdin contains 0 test cases, and `i` is the third element in the set `cx`. If `i` is between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, then `tmp` is 3, otherwise `tmp` is 2.**

The value of `tmp` is incremented by 1. Since `tmp` was either 1 or 2, it is now either 2 or 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
