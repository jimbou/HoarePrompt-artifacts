Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 3 and 100 inclusive, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is 2, `bx` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, and `cx` is an empty set. In all other cases, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is a set containing the integer `x` and possibly other integers. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The values of `t`, `r`, `_`, `n`, `bx`, `cx`, and `ax` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `a` is now an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, and the value of `x` is now an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive. The stdin now contains `t-4` test cases.
