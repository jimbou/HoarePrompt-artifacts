Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is 2, `x` is an integer**

The code updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of its current value (1000000007) and the value of `x`. This means that `ax` will be either its original value (1000000007) or the value of `x`, whichever is smaller. The other variables remain unchanged.
