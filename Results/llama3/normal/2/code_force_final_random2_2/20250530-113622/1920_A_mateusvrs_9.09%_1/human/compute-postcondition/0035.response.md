Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 test cases, `_` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `n` is 0, `cx` is a set containing integers that must have at least 1 integer, `ax` is an integer between 1 and 1000000007 inclusive, `bx` is an integer between -1 and 1000000000 inclusive, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, `bx` is less than `ax`, `i` is the first integer in the set `cx`, `tmp` is 1, and the current value of `i` is between `bx` and `ax` inclusive.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `tmp` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
