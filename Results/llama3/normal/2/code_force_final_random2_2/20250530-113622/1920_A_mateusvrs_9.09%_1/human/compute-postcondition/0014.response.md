The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` is 2, `bx` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. In all other cases, `bx` is -1. `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer.**
