Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise -1, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, `r` is a list containing one integer which is the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains -1 test cases. If `a` is 1, `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is 2, `cx` is an empty set and `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `cx` is a set containing one integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive.**

The code updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. This change affects the value of `ax` only, and the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ax` is now the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, which means it can take any value between -1000000000 and 1000000007 inclusive. The rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
