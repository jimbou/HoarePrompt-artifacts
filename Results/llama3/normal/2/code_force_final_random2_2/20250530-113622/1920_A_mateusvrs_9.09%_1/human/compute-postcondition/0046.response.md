The only variables in the loop head are variables  `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`. 
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `stdin` contains 0 test cases, `_` is an integer between 3 and 101 inclusive, `n` is 0, `cx` is a set containing integers, `ax` is an integer between 1 and 1000000007 inclusive, `bx` is an integer between -1 and 1000000000 inclusive, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` is a list containing a single element 0. Otherwise, `r` is a list containing one integer which is the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive.**
