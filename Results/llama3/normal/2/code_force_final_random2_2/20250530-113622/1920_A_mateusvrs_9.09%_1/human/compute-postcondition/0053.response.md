Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is 2, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, `r` is a list containing one integer which is the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, stdin contains -2 test cases.***
