To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t` test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 100) followed by `n` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `x` (`a` in {1,2,3}, 1 <= `x` <= 10^9), `_` is 0**
