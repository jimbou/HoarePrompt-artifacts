Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tmp` is 0, `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and all x values where a is 2, `bx` is the maximum of -1 and all x values where a is 1, `cx` is a set containing all x values where a is not 1 or 2, `r` is a list containing one integer which is the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive, stdin contains -n test cases, a is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, x is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive. bx is less than ax
Code of the loop:
for i in cx:
    if i >= bx and i <= ax:
        tmp += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tmp` is 0 or 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and all x values where a is 2, `bx` is the maximum of -1 and all x values where a is 1, `cx` is a set containing at least one x value where a is not 1 or 2, `r` is a list containing one integer which is the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive, stdin contains -n test cases, a is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, x is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, and `tmp` is 1 if and only if the current value of `i` is an element in `cx` such that `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tmp` is 1 or 2 if `i` is between `bx` and `ax` inclusive and `i` is an element in `cx`, otherwise `tmp` is 0 or 1. `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and all x values where a is 2, `bx` is the maximum of -1 and all x values where a is 1, `cx` is a set containing at least two x values where a is not 1 or 2, `r` is a list containing one integer which is the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive, stdin contains -n test cases, a is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, x is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tmp` is 2 or 3 if `i` is between `bx` and `ax` inclusive and `i` is an element in `cx`, otherwise `tmp` is 1 or 2. `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and all x values where a is 2, `bx` is the maximum of -1 and all x values where a is 1, `cx` is a set containing at least two x values where a is not 1 or 2, `r` is a list containing one integer which is the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive, stdin contains -n test cases, a is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, x is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, `i` is another element in `cx`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
