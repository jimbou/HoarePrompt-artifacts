Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, _ is an integer between 3 and 101 inclusive, n is an integer, cx is an empty set, ax is 1000000007, bx is -1, a is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, x is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, r is a list containing one integer which is the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive, stdin contains -1 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    a, x = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 1:
        bx = max(x, bx)
    elif a == 2:
        ax = min(x, ax)
    else:
        cx.add(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise -1, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, `r` is a list containing one integer which is the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, stdin contains -2 test cases. If `a` is 1, `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is 2, `cx` is an empty set and `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `cx` is a set containing one integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive and `a` is an integer between 3 and 100 inclusive.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains -1 test cases. If `a` is 1, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`, `cx` is an empty set, and `r` is a list containing one integer which is the difference between `ax` and the previous value of `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between the previous value of `bx` and `ax` inclusive. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is an empty set, and `r` is a list containing one integer which is the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is a set containing one integer which is `x`, and `r` is a list containing one integer which is the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, stdin contains -2 test cases. If `a` is 1, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`, `cx` is an empty set, and `r` is a list containing one integer which is the difference between `ax` and the previous value of `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between the previous value of `bx` and `ax` inclusive. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is an empty set, and `r` is a list containing one integer which is the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is a set containing one integer which is `x`, and `r` is a list containing one integer which is the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
