The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and set `cx`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `cx`. If the set `cx` has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 test cases, `_` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `n` is 0, `ax` is an integer between 1 and 1000000007 inclusive, `bx` is an integer between -1 and 1000000000 inclusive, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, `bx` is less than `ax`, and `tmp` is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the set `cx` must have at least 1 integer and the `i` is the first integer in the set `cx`.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 test cases, `_` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `n` is 0, `cx` is a set containing integers that must have at least 1 integer, `ax` is an integer between 1 and 1000000007 inclusive, `bx` is an integer between -1 and 1000000000 inclusive, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, `bx` is less than `ax`, `i` is the first integer in the set `cx`, and `tmp` is 0**
