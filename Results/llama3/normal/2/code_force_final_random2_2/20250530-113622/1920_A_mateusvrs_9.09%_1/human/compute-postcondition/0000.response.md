Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, r is an empty list, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n lines, each containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9).**

Explanation:
The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since `t` is between 1 and 500 inclusive, it can take any integer value in this range. The second line initializes an empty list `r`. No other variables are affected. The state of `stdin` remains the same, containing `t` test cases. Each test case still starts with an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `x` (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9).
