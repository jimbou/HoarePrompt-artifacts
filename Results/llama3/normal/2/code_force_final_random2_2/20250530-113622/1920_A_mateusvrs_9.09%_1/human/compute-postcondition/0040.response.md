The only object in the loop head is variable  i and set cx, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cx.  If the set cx has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, cx has at least 2 integers, i is the second integer in the set cx. So for the loop to be executed one more time the set cx must have at least 3 integers and the i is the third integer in the set cx.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 test cases, `_` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `n` is 0, `cx` is a set containing integers that must have at least 3 integers, `ax` is an integer between 1 and 1000000007 inclusive, `bx` is an integer between -1 and 1000000000 inclusive, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, `bx` is less than `ax`. If the third integer `i` in the set `cx` is between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, then `tmp` is 3. Otherwise, `tmp` is 2. `i` is the third integer in the set `cx`.**
