Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 3 and 100 inclusive, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. If `a` is 2, `bx` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, and `cx` is an empty set. In all other cases, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is a set containing the integer `x` and possibly other integers. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the set `cx` now contains the integer `x` in all cases where `a` is not 2. If `a` is 2, `cx` remains an empty set.
