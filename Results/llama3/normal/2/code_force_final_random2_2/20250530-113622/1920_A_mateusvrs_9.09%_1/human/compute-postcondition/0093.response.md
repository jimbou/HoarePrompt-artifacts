To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `_` is the loop variable, it will take on values from 0 to `n-1` during the loop execution.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set, `r` is a list containing two integers where the first integer is the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive and the second integer is either 0 if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, or the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive if `bx` is less than `ax`, `stdin` contains `-n` test cases, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, `_` is 0**
