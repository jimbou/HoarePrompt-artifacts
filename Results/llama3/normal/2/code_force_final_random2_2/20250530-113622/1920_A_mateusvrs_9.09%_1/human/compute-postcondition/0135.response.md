Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, n is 0, ax is the minimum of all x values when a is 2, bx is the maximum of all x values when a is 1, cx is a set containing all x values when a is 3, r is a list containing three integers where the first integer is the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive, the second integer is 0 if bx is greater than or equal to ax, otherwise it is the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive, and the third integer is 0 if bx is greater than or equal to ax, otherwise it is the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive, a is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, x is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, _ is n, stdin contains 0 test cases, and if bx is less than ax, tmp is the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive, and i is the last element in the set cx.***
