Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an integer not equal to 1 and not equal to 2, `x` is an integer**

In this output state, the only change is that the set `cx` now contains the integer `x`, which was previously empty. All other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still between 1 and 500, `r` still an empty list, `stdin` still containing `t-2` test cases, `_` still 0, `n` still between 1 and 100, `ax` still 1000000007, `bx` still -1, `a` still not equal to 1 or 2, and `x` still an integer.
