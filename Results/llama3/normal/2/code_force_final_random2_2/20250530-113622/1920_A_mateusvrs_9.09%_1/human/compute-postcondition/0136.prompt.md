Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, r is an empty list, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n lines, each containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cx = set()
    ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
    bx = -1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, x = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1:
            bx = max(x, bx)
        elif a == 2:
            ax = min(x, ax)
        else:
            cx.add(x)
    if bx >= ax:
        r.append(0)
    else:
        tmp = 0
        for i in cx:
            if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                tmp += 1
        r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `stdin` contains 0 test cases, `_` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `n` is 0, `cx` is a set containing integers, `ax` is an integer between 1 and 1000000007 inclusive, `bx` is an integer between -1 and 1000000000 inclusive, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` is a list containing a single element 0. Otherwise, `r` is a list containing one integer which is the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, n is greater than or equal to 0, ax is the minimum of 1000000007 and all x values where a is 2, bx is the maximum of -1 and all x values where a is 1, cx is a set containing all x values where a is not 1 or 2, r is a list containing two integers where the first integer is the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive and the second integer is either 0 if bx is greater than or equal to ax, or the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive if bx is less than ax, stdin contains -n test cases, a is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, x is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, n is 0, ax is the minimum of all x values when a is 2, bx is the maximum of all x values when a is 1, cx is a set containing all x values when a is 3, r is a list containing three integers where the first integer is the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive, the second integer is 0 if bx is greater than or equal to ax, otherwise it is the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive, and the third integer is 0 if bx is greater than or equal to ax, otherwise it is the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive, a is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, x is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, _ is n, stdin contains 0 test cases, and if bx is less than ax, tmp is the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive, and i is the last element in the set cx.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
