Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, r is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n lines, each containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9), _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, cx is an empty set, ax is 1000000007, bx is -1
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    a, x = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 1:
        bx = max(x, bx)
    elif a == 2:
        ax = min(x, ax)
    else:
        cx.add(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. In all other cases, `bx` is -1. `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is 2, `bx` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, and `cx` is an empty set. In all other cases, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is a set containing the integer `x` and possibly other integers. `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 3 and 100 inclusive, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is a set containing the integer `x` if `a` is not 2, otherwise `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is 2, `bx` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, and `cx` is an empty set. In all other cases, `bx` is the maximum of the maximum of `x` and -1 and the previous value of `bx`, and `cx` is a set containing the integer `x` and possibly other integers. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
