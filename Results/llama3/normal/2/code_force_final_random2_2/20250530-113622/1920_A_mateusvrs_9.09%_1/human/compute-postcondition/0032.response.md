Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 test cases, `_` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `n` is 0, `cx` is a set containing integers, `ax` is an integer between 1 and 1000000007 inclusive, `bx` is an integer between -1 and 1000000000 inclusive, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, `bx` is less than `ax`, and `tmp` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `tmp` that has been initialized to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
