Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, n is greater than 2, a is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, x is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive and is assigned the value of the second integer from the input, _ is 2. If a is 1, ax is either 1000000007 or the minimum of x and 1000000007 depending on whether a is 2 or not, bx is the maximum of x and the previous value of bx if a is 1, otherwise the maximum of x and -1, cx is either an empty set or a set containing one or two integers between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive depending on whether a is 2 or not, r is a list containing two integers where the first integer is the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive and the second integer is either 0 if bx is greater than or equal to ax, or the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive if bx is less than ax. stdin contains -n-1 test cases if a is not 2, otherwise stdin contains -n-2 test cases.***
