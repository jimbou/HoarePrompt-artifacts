Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `n` is 0, `ax` is the minimum of all x values when a is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all x values when a is 1, `cx` is a set containing all x values when a is 3, `r` is a list containing three integers where the first integer is the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive, the second integer is either 0 if bx is greater than or equal to ax, or the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive if bx is less than ax, and the third integer is the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, `_` is n, `tmp` is the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive, stdin contains 0 test cases, and `i` is the last element in the set `cx`.**

In this output state, the list `r` has been updated to include a third integer, which is the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive. The other variables remain unchanged.
