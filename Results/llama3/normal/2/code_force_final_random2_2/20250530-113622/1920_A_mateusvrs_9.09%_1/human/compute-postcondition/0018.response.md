Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `cx` is a set containing the integer `x` if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the integer `x` and possibly other integers. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` is 2, `bx` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. In all other cases, `bx` is -1. `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The value of `t` remains unchanged, ranging from 1 to 500. The list `r` is still empty. There are `t-3` test cases remaining in the standard input. The variable `_` is still 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged, ranging from 2 to 100. The set `cx` now contains the integer `x` if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise it contains `x` and possibly other integers. The value of `bx` depends on the value of `a`: if `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1; if `a` is 2, `bx` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007; otherwise, `bx` is -1. The value of `a` remains unchanged, ranging from 1 to 100. The value of `x` remains unchanged, ranging from -1000000000 to 1000000000.
