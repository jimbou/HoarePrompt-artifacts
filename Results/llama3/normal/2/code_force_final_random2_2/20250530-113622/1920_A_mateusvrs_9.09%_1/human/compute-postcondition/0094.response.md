Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set, `r` is a list containing two integers where the first integer is the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive and the second integer is either 0 if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, or the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive if `bx` is less than `ax`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, `_` is 0, stdin contains `-n-1` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` is now an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, and the value of `x` is now an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive. The values of `t`, `n`, `ax`, `bx`, `cx`, `r`, and `_` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1.
