Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, n is greater than or equal to 0, ax is 1000000007, bx is -1, cx is an empty set, r is a list containing two integers where the first integer is the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive and the second integer is either 0 if bx is greater than or equal to ax, or the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive if bx is less than ax, stdin contains -n test cases, a is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, x is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, _ is 1
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    a, x = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 1:
        bx = max(x, bx)
    elif a == 2:
        ax = min(x, ax)
    else:
        cx.add(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `ax` is either 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 depending on whether `a` is 2 or not, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise -1, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing one integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive depending on whether `a` is 2 or not, `r` is a list containing two integers where the first integer is the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive and the second integer is either 0 if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, or the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive if `bx` is less than `ax`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, `_` is 0, stdin contains `-n-1` test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive and is assigned the value of the second integer from the input, `_` is 1. If `a` is 1, `ax` is either 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 depending on whether `a` is 2 or not, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx` if `a` is 1, otherwise the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing one integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive depending on whether `a` is 2 or not, `r` is a list containing two integers where the first integer is the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive and the second integer is either 0 if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, or the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive if `bx` is less than `ax`, and stdin contains `-n-1` test cases. If `a` is not 1, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is either 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1 if `a` is 2, otherwise `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing one integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing one integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive. `r` is a list containing two integers where the first integer is the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive and the second integer is either 0 if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, or the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive if `bx` is less than `ax`. stdin contains `-n-2` test cases if `a` is 2, otherwise stdin contains `-n-1` test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, n is greater than 2, a is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, x is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive and is assigned the value of the second integer from the input, _ is 2. If a is 1, ax is either 1000000007 or the minimum of x and 1000000007 depending on whether a is 2 or not, bx is the maximum of x and the previous value of bx if a is 1, otherwise the maximum of x and -1, cx is either an empty set or a set containing one or two integers between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive depending on whether a is 2 or not, r is a list containing two integers where the first integer is the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive and the second integer is either 0 if bx is greater than or equal to ax, or the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive if bx is less than ax. stdin contains -n-1 test cases if a is not 2, otherwise stdin contains -n-2 test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
