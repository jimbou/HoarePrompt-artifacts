Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program initializes variables to keep track of the minimum and maximum values of x for constraints of type 1 and 2, respectively. It also initializes a set to store the x values for constraints of type 3.

2. The program then iterates over each constraint. For constraints of type 1, it updates the minimum value of x. For constraints of type 2, it updates the maximum value of x. For constraints of type 3, it adds the x value to the set.

3. After processing all constraints, the program checks if the minimum value of x is greater than or equal to the maximum value of x. If so, it means that there are no possible values of k that satisfy all constraints, so it appends 0 to the result list.

4. Otherwise, the program calculates the number of possible values of k by subtracting the minimum value of x from the maximum value of x, adding 1, and then subtracting the number of x values in the set that fall within this range.

5. Finally, the program prints the results for each test case.

The program correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of possible values of k that satisfy all constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
