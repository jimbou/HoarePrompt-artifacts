Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the results. It accepts no parameters and returns no values. The function reads an integer t, representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n, representing the number of lines, followed by n lines, each containing two integers a and x. The function processes each test case by maintaining the minimum value of x when a is 2, the maximum value of x when a is 1, and a set of x values when a is 3. It then calculates the difference between the minimum and maximum x values plus 1, minus the number of x values in the set that fall within this range. The function stores these results in a list and prints them at the end. The final state of the program is that the input has been processed, and the results have been printed to stdout.**
