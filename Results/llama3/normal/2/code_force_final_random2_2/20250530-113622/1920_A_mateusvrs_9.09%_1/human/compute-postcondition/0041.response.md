Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 test cases, `_` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `n` is 0, `cx` is a set containing integers that must have at least 3 integers, `ax` is an integer between 1 and 1000000007 inclusive, `bx` is an integer between -1 and 1000000000 inclusive, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, `bx` is less than `ax`. If the third integer `i` in the set `cx` is between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, then `tmp` is 4. Otherwise, `tmp` is 3. `i` is the third integer in the set `cx`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `tmp` has been incremented by 1. If the third integer `i` in the set `cx` is between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, then `tmp` is now 4, otherwise it is 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
