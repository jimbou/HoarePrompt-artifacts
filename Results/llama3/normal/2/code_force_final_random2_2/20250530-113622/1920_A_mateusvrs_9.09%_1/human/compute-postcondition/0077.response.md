Output State: **`tmp` is 0, `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and all x values where a is 2, `bx` is the maximum of -1 and all x values where a is 1, `cx` is a set containing all x values where a is not 1 or 2, `r` is a list containing one integer which is the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive, stdin contains -n test cases, a is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, x is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive. bx is less than ax**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `tmp` which is initialized to 0. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
