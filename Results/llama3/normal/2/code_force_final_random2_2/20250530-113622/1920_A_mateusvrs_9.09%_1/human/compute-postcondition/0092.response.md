Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, n is greater than or equal to 0, ax is 1000000007, bx is -1, cx is an empty set, r is a list containing two integers where the first integer is the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive and the second integer is either 0 if bx is greater than or equal to ax, or the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive if bx is less than ax, stdin contains -n test cases, a is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, x is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, _ is 1**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `r`, `a`, `x`, and `_` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The value of `ax` is set to 1000000007, and the value of `bx` is set to -1. The set `cx` is initialized as an empty set. The list `r` still contains two integers, but their values are not explicitly defined in the output state as they depend on the values of `ax`, `bx`, and `cx`, which are now known. Stdin still contains -n test cases.
