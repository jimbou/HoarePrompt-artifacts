The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 3 and 100 inclusive. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is 2, `bx` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, and `cx` is an empty set. In all other cases, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is a set containing the integer `x` and possibly other integers. `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`.**
