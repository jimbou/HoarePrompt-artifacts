Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise -1, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, `r` is a list containing one integer which is the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains -1 test cases. If `a` is 1, `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is 2, `cx` is an empty set and `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `cx` is a set containing one integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `ax`, `bx`, `x`, and `r` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `a` is updated to be an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, and the value of `x` is updated to be an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive. The stdin now contains -1 test cases. The conditions for `cx` and `ax` are also updated based on the value of `a`.
