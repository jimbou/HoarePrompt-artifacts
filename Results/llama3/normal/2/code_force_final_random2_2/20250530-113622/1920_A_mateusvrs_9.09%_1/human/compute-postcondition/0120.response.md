Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `n` is 0, `ax` is the minimum of all x values when a is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all x values when a is 1, `cx` is a set containing all x values when a is 3, `r` is a list containing three integers where the first integer is the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive, the second integer is 0, and the third integer is 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, `_` is n, and stdin contains 0 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to include an additional element, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `r` now contains three integers: the first integer is the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, the second integer is 0, and the third integer is 0.
