Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `a` is an integer not equal to 1. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. Otherwise, `cx` is a set containing the integer `x` and `a` is not equal to 2. In both cases, `bx` is -1.***
