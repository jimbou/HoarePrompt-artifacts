Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, n is 0, ax is the minimum of all x values when a is 2, bx is the maximum of all x values when a is 1, cx is a set containing all x values when a is 3, r is a list containing two integers where the first integer is the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive and the second integer is either 0 if bx is greater than or equal to ax, or the difference between ax and bx plus 1 minus the number of integers in cx that are between bx and ax inclusive if bx is less than ax, a is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, x is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, _ is n, stdin contains 0 test cases.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the variables have been updated accordingly. The value of `t` remains unchanged, `n` is now 0, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values when `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values when `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing all `x` values when `a` is 3, and `r` is a list containing two integers that represent the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive. The values of `a`, `x`, and `_` are also updated, and stdin contains 0 test cases.
