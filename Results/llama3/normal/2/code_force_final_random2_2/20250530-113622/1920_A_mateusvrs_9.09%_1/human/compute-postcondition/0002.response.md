Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, r is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n lines, each containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9), _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, cx is an empty set, ax is 1000000007, bx is -1**

In this final state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `r` is still empty as no elements are added to it. The `stdin` now contains `t-1` test cases because one test case has been read and processed by the code. The variables `n`, `cx`, `ax`, and `bx` are assigned new values based on the code. The value of `_` remains 0 as it is not modified.
