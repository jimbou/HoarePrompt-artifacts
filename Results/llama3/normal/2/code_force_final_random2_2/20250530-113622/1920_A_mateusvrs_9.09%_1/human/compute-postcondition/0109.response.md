Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive and is assigned the value of the second integer from the input, `_` is 1. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing one integer between -100000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive. If `a` is not 2, `ax` is either 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is a set containing one integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive. `r` is a list containing two integers where the first integer is the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive and the second integer is either 0 if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, or the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive if `bx` is less than `ax`. stdin contains `-n-2` test cases if `a` is 2, otherwise stdin contains `-n-1` test cases.***
