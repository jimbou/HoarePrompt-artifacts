Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an integer between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, `r` is a list containing one integer which is the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains -2 test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`, and `r` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `x` are updated to the integers read from the input, which can be any integer. The stdin now contains -2 test cases, as one test case has been read.
