Output State: **The loop will terminate when `y` is no longer less than `x`. Since `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration and `y` remains unchanged, the loop will terminate when `x` is equal to `n + 2`. At this point, `t` will be `n + 2 - (n + 1) + 1 = 2`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop will terminate when `x` is equal to `n + 2`, and at this point, `t` will be 2. The values of `a`, `n`, `s`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged.
