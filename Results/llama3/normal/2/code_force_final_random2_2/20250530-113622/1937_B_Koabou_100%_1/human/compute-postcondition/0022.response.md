Output State: **`a` is a list containing four elements: the first element is an integer (n >= 2), the second element is a string (the first input of the first test case), the third element is a binary string of length n, the fourth element is a binary string of length n; `n` is an integer (n > 2). If the current value of the first element of `a` at index `i + 1` is '1' and the current value of the second element of `a` at index `i` is '0', then `s` is a string containing the first i + 1 characters of the first element of `a` and the rest of the characters of the second element of `a`, `x` is 1 and `y` is 2. Otherwise, `s` is an empty list, `x` is 0 and `y` is 2. `_` is 2 and `i` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
