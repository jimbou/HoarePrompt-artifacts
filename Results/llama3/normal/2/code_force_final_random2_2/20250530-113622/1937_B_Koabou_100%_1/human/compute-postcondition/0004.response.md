Output State: **`a` is a list containing two elements: the first element is an integer (n >= 2), the second element is a string (the first input of the first test case); `n` is an integer (n >= 2); stdin contains at least one test case, each test case contains two inputs: two binary strings of length n; `_` is 1**

In this output state, the list `a` now contains two elements: the first element is an integer (n >= 2), which was already present, and the second element is a string, which is the first input of the first test case. The value of `n` remains the same, an integer (n >= 2). The stdin now contains at least one test case, but the first input of the first test case has been consumed, leaving only two binary strings of length n as inputs for each test case. The value of `_` remains 1.
