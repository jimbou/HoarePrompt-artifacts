Output State: **`a` is a list containing four elements: the first element is an integer (n >= 2), the second element is a string (the first input of the first test case), the third element is a binary string of length n, the fourth element is a binary string of length n; `n` is an integer (n >= 2); `s` is a list. If the current value of the first element of `a` at index `i + 1` is '1' and the current value of the second element of `a` at index `i` is '0', then `s` is a string containing the first i + 1 characters of the first element of `a` and the rest of the characters of the second element of `a`. Otherwise, `s` is an empty list. `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `_` is 2; `i` is n - 1; `t` is 1.**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state remain unchanged, except that a new variable `t` has been introduced and assigned the value 1. The rest of the variables retain their original values and properties.
