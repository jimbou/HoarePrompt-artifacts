Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is an empty list, n is an integer (n >= 2), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each remaining test case contains three inputs: first an integer (n >= 2), then two binary strings of length n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(2):
    a.append(input())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list containing one integer (n >= 2), `n` is an integer (n >= 2), stdin contains at least one test case, each test case contains three inputs: first an integer (n >= 2), then two binary strings of length n

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list containing two elements: the first element is an integer (n >= 2), the second element is a string (the first input of the first test case); `n` is an integer (n >= 2); stdin contains at least one test case, each test case contains two inputs: two binary strings of length n; `_` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list containing three elements: the first element is an integer (n >= 2), the second element is a string (the first input of the first test case), the third element is a binary string of length n; `n` is an integer (n >= 2); stdin contains at least one test case, each test case contains one input: a binary string of length n; `_` is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
