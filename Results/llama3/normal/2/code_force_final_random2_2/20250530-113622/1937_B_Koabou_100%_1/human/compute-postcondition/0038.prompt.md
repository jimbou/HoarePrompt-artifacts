Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list containing four elements: the first element is an integer (n >= 2), the second element is a string (the first input of the first test case), the third element is a binary string of length n, the fourth element is a binary string of length n; `n` is an integer (n >= 2); `s` is a list. If the current value of the first element of `a` at index `i + 1` is '1' and the current value of the second element of `a` at index `i` is '0', then `s` is a string containing the first i + 1 characters of the first element of `a` and the rest of the characters of the second element of `a`. Otherwise, `s` is an empty list. `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `_` is 2; `i` is n - 1; `t` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(y, x):
    if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
        t = x - i + 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list containing four elements: the first element is an integer (n >= 2), the second element is a string (the first input of the first test case), the third element is a binary string of length n, the fourth element is a binary string of length n; `n` is an integer (n >= 2); `s` is a list. If the current value of the first element of `a` at index `i + 1` is '1' and the current value of the second element of `a` at index `i` is '0', then `s` is a string containing the first `i + 1` characters of the first element of `a` and the rest of the characters of the second element of `a`. Otherwise, `s` is an empty list. `x` is greater than 0; `y` is less than `x`; `_` is 2; `i` is `n - 1`. If the substring of `a[1]` from index `i` to `x` is equal to the substring of `s` from index `i + 1` to `x + 1`, then `t` is `x - i + 1`. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *a is a list containing four elements: the first element is an integer (n >= 2), the second element is a string (the first input of the first test case), the third element is a binary string of length n, the fourth element is a binary string of length n; n is an integer (n >= 2); s is a list. If the current value of the first element of a at index i + 1 is '1' and the current value of the second element of a at index i is '0', then s is a string containing the first i + 1 characters of the first element of a and the rest of the characters of the second element of a. Otherwise, s is an empty list. x is greater than n; y is less than x; _ is 2; i is n. If the substring of a[1] from index i to x is equal to the substring of s from index i + 1 to x + 1, then t is x - i + 1. Otherwise, t remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list containing four elements: the first element is an integer (n >= 2), the second element is a string (the first input of the first test case), the third element is a binary string of length n, the fourth element is a binary string of length n; `n` is an integer (n >= 2); `s` is a list. If the current value of the first element of `a` at index `i + 1` is '1' and the current value of the second element of `a` at index `i` is '0', then `s` is a string containing the first `i + 1` characters of the first element of `a` and the rest of the characters of the second element of `a`. Otherwise, `s` is an empty list. `x` is greater than `n + 1`; `y` is less than `x`; `_` is 2; `i` is `n + 1`. If the substring of `a[1]` from index `i` to `x` is equal to the substring of `s` from index `i + 1` to `x + 1`, then `t` is `x - i + 1`. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
