The code `a.append(input())` appends the first input from stdin to the list `a`. The first input from stdin is an integer (n >= 2). 

Output State: **`a` is a list containing one integer (n >= 2), `n` is an integer (n >= 2), stdin contains at least one test case, each test case contains three inputs: first an integer (n >= 2), then two binary strings of length n**
