Output: **The loop will terminate when `y` is no longer less than `x`. Since `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration and `y` remains unchanged, the loop will terminate when `x` is equal to `n + 2`. At this point, `t` will be `n + 2 - (n + 1) + 1 = 2`, and the string `s` is printed without any separator**
