Output State: **a is a list containing four elements: the first element is an integer (n >= 2), the second element is a string (the first input of the first test case), the third element is a binary string of length n, the fourth element is a binary string of length n; n is an integer (n >= 2); s is a string containing the first i + 1 characters of the first element of a and the rest of the characters of the second element of a; x is 0; y is 0; _ is 2; i is 0. The first element of a at index i + 1 is '1' and the second element of a at index i is '0'.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the first `i + 1` characters of the first element of `a` and the rest of the characters of the second element of `a`. The value of `x` has been updated to `i`, which is 0. The values of `y`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged. The first element of `a` at index `i + 1` is '1' and the second element of `a` at index `i` is '0'.
