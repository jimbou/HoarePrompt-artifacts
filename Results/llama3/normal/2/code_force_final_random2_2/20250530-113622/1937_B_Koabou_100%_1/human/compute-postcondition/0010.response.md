Postcondition: **`a` is a list containing four elements: the first element is an integer (n >= 2), the second element is a string (the first input of the first test case), the third element is a binary string of length n, the fourth element is a binary string of length n; `n` is an integer (n >= 2); `s` is an empty list; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `_` is 2; `i` is 0. The current value of the first element of `a` at index `i + 1` is '0' and the current value of the second element of `a` at index `i` is '1'.**
