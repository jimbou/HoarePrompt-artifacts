Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider the input:

```
3
2
11
00
```

The program will output:

```
110
1
```

However, the correct output should be:

```
100
2
```

The program fails to consider the case where the lexicographically smallest string can be obtained by moving down first and then moving right. In this case, the program incorrectly outputs the string "110" and the count "1", when the correct output should be the string "100" and the count "2".

The program's logic is flawed because it only checks for the case where the lexicographically smallest string can be obtained by moving right first and then moving down. It does not consider the case where the smallest string can be obtained by moving down first and then moving right. This is evident in the line `if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':`, which only checks for the case where the top row has a '1' and the bottom row has a '0'. It does not check for the case where the top row has a '0' and the bottom row has a '1'.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
