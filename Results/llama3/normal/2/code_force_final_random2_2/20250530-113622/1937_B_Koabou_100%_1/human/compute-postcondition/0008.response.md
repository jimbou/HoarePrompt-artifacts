Output State: **a is a list containing four elements: the first element is an integer (n >= 2), the second element is a string (the first input of the first test case), the third element is a binary string of length n, the fourth element is a binary string of length n; n is an integer (n >= 2); s is an empty list; x is 0; y is 0; _ is 2**

The code initializes three new variables: `s` as an empty list, `x` as 0, and `y` as 0. The initial state's variables `a`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged as the code does not modify them. Stdin remains empty as there are no input operations in the code.
