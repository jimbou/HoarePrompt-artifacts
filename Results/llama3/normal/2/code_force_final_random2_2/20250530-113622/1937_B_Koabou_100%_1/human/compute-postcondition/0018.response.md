Postcondition: ***`a` is a list containing four elements: the first element is an integer (n >= 2), the second element is a string (the first input of the first test case), the third element is a binary string of length n, the fourth element is a binary string of length n; `n` is an integer (n >= 2); `s` is a list. If the current value of the first element of `a` at index `i + 1` is '1' and the current value of the second element of `a` at index `i` is '0', then `s` is a string containing the first i + 1 characters of the first element of `a` and the rest of the characters of the second element of `a`. Otherwise, `s` is an empty list. If `a[0][i + 1]` is '0' and `a[1][i]` is '1', then `x` is 0 and `y` is 1. Otherwise, `x` is 0 and `y` is 0. `_` is 2 and `i` is 1.***
