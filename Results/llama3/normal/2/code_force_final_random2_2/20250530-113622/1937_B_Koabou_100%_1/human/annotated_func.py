#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer (n >= 2), then two binary strings of length n.
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: `a` is a list containing four elements: the first element is an integer (n >= 2), the second element is a string (the first input of the first test case), the third element is a binary string of length n, the fourth element is a binary string of length n; `n` is an integer (n >= 2); stdin is empty; `_` is 2
    s = []
    x = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
            y = i
        
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]

    #State: `a` is a list containing four elements: the first element is an integer (n >= 2), the second element is a string (the first input of the first test case), the third element is a binary string of length n, the fourth element is a binary string of length n; `n` is an integer (n >= 2); `s` is a list. If the current value of the first element of `a` at index `i + 1` is '1' and the current value of the second element of `a` at index `i` is '0', then `s` is a string containing the first i + 1 characters of the first element of `a` and the rest of the characters of the second element of `a`. Otherwise, `s` is an empty list. `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `_` is 2; `i` is n - 1.
    t = 1
    for i in range(y, x):
        if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: The loop will terminate when `y` is no longer less than `x`. Since `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration and `y` remains unchanged, the loop will terminate when `x` is equal to `n + 2`. At this point, `t` will be `n + 2 - (n + 1) + 1 = 2`.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: The value of s (where s is the value of s after the loop terminates)
    print(t)
    #This is printed: 2

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two binary strings of the same length from standard input, modifies the first string by replacing a suffix with the corresponding suffix from the second string if a specific condition is met, and prints the modified string and the length of the replaced suffix.
