Output State: **`a` is a list containing four elements: the first element is an integer (n >= 2), the second element is a string (the first input of the first test case), the third element is a binary string of length n, the fourth element is a binary string of length n; `n` is an integer (n >= 2); stdin is empty; `_` is 2**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `a` will contain four elements: the first element is an integer greater than or equal to 2, the second element is a string representing the first input of the first test case, and the third and fourth elements are binary strings of length `n`. The variable `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 2. The standard input `stdin` is empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The loop counter `_` is 2, indicating that the loop has executed twice.
