To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `y`, and `x`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `y` is less than `x`, and `x` is greater than `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes `n + 1`. Since `y` is less than `x`, we can keep `y` unchanged. However, for the loop to execute again, `x` must be greater than `n + 1`.

State: **`a` is a list containing four elements: the first element is an integer (n >= 2), the second element is a string (the first input of the first test case), the third element is a binary string of length n, the fourth element is a binary string of length n; `n` is an integer (n >= 2); `s` is a list. If the current value of the first element of `a` at index `i + 1` is '1' and the current value of the second element of `a` at index `i` is '0', then `s` is a string containing the first `i + 1` characters of the first element of `a` and the rest of the characters of the second element of `a`. Otherwise, `s` is an empty list. `x` is greater than `n + 1`; `y` is less than `x`; `_` is 2; `i` is `n + 1`. If the substring of `a[1]` from index `i` to `x` is equal to the substring of `s` from index `i + 1` to `x + 1`, then `t` is `x - i + 1`. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged.**
