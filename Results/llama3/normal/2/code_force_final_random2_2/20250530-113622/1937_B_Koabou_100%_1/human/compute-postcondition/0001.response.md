To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `_` and the range `2`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the loop execution, we can ignore it. The range `2` is a constant and doesn't need adjustment.

However, we need to consider the state of the stdin, which contains multiple test cases minus one test case. For the loop to execute, there must be at least two test cases remaining in the stdin.

State: **a is an empty list, n is an integer (n >= 2), stdin contains at least two test cases, each test case contains three inputs: first an integer (n >= 2), then two binary strings of length n**
