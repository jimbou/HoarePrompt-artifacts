Output State: **`a` is a list containing three elements: the first element is an integer (n >= 2), the second element is a string (the first input of the first test case), the third element is a binary string of length n; `n` is an integer (n >= 2); stdin contains at least one test case, each test case contains one input: a binary string of length n; `_` is 2**

In this output state, the list `a` has been updated to include a new element, which is a binary string of length `n`, obtained from the input. The value of `n` remains the same, and the stdin still contains at least one test case, but with one less input, as one binary string has been read and appended to the list `a`. The value of `_` remains unchanged.
