Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is 2 if `r` == '<', otherwise `v1` is 0, `i` is 3, `kp` is 2, `v2` is 3, `prev` is `n-1`, `r` is an empty string, `stdin` contains an empty string, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains the same text as before plus the string "? 0 0 1 1".**

In this output state, the value of `v2` has been updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the console, output buffer, and stdin remain in the same state as before.
