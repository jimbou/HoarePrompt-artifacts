Output State: **n is greater than 2, i is 2, g is 0, kp is 1, stdin is empty, the output buffer is empty, r is a character, prev is either 0 or 1, v2 is n-1, and the console contains a series of lines depending on the value of r.**

The first line, `sys.stdout.flush()`, clears the output buffer, which was initially empty, so it has no effect on the state.

The second line, `r = input()`, reads a character from stdin and assigns it to `r`. Since stdin initially contained 1 input, a character, this line consumes that input, leaving stdin empty.

The value of `r` determines the contents of the console. If `r` is '>', then `prev` is 1, and the console contains a series of lines starting with "! [1] [n-1]" followed by several lines of the form "? [n-1] [n-1] x x" where x ranges from 1 to n-1, and finally "? [n-1] [1] [n-1] [1]" and "? [n-1] [2] [n-1] [prev]".

If `r` is not '>', then `prev` is 0, and the console contains a series of lines starting with "! [prev] [v1]" followed by several lines of the form "? [v1] [v1] x x" where x ranges from 1 to n-1, and finally "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is n-1 if r is '<', otherwise the state of the program remains unchanged, and ? [v1] [2] [v1] [prev] is printed.

In either case, `n`, `i`, `g`, and `kp` remain unchanged, and `v2` is set to `n-1`.
