The code prints a formatted string containing the values of `v1` and `v2`. Where `v1` is 0 and `v2` is 1.
Output: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v2` is 1, `stdin` is empty, and the output buffer contains "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either `n-1` if `r` is '>' or either 0, 1, 2, ..., or `n-2` depending on the value of `r`, and `v1` is 0, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1"**
