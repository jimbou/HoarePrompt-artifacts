The code prints a formatted string containing a question mark, the value of `v1`, the value of `i`, the value of `v1` again, and the value of `prev`.

Based on the precondition, `i` is 3, so the second and third values in the string will be 3.

The value of `v1` is not explicitly defined in the precondition, so we can't determine its exact value. However, we can describe it as `v1`.

The value of `prev` depends on the value of `r`. If `r` is '>', then `prev` is 2. Otherwise, `prev` is either 0 or 1.

Output: **? [v1] 3 [v1] [prev] (where v1 is the value of v1 and prev is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the value of r)**
