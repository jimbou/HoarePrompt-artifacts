Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, g is 0, v1 is n-1 if all r == '<', otherwise v1 is 0, i is n, kp is 2, v2 is n-1, prev is n-1, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains the same text as before plus the string "? 0 0 1 1" repeated n-1 times.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the final values of the variables are as follows:

*   `n` remains the same as the initial value.
*   `g` remains 0.
*   `v1` is `n-1` if all inputs `r` were '<', otherwise it is 0.
*   `i` is equal to `n`.
*   `kp` remains 2.
*   `v2` is `n-1`.
*   `prev` remains `n-1`.
*   `stdin` is empty.
*   The output buffer is empty.
*   The console contains the same text as before plus the string "? 0 0 1 1" repeated `n-1` times.
