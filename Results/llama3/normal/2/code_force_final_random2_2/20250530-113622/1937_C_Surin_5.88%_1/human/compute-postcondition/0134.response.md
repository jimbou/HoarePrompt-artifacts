Output: **n is an integer greater than 2, g is 0, v1 is 0 if r is '>', otherwise v1 is n-1 if all r == '<', otherwise v1 is 0, i is 2, kp is 2, v2 is n-1, prev is 1 if r is '>', otherwise prev is 0, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains the same text as before plus the string "? 0 0 1 1" repeated n-1 times, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is either n-1 or 0 depending on the value of r, i is 2, and prev is either 1 or 0 depending on the value of r, r is a string containing the input from stdin**
