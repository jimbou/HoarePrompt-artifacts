Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 3, g is 0, v1 is 0 if r is '>', otherwise v1 is n-1, i is 3, kp is 2, v2 is n-1, stdin is empty, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains the same text as before plus the string "? 0 0 1 1" repeated n-1 times, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is either n-1 or 0 depending on the value of r, i is 3, and prev is either 2 or 3 depending on the value of r.***
