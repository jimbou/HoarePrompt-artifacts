Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, g is 0, v1 is 0 if r is '>', otherwise v1 is n-1 if all r == '<', otherwise v1 is 0, i is 2, kp is 2, v2 is n-1, prev is 2, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains the same text as before plus the string "? 0 0 1 1" repeated n-1 times, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is either n-1 or 0 depending on the value of r, i is 2, and prev is either 2 depending on the value of i, r is a string containing the input from stdin**

In this output state, the value of `prev` has been updated to be equal to `i`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The console still contains the same text as before, with the string "? 0 0 1 1" repeated n-1 times, and the output buffer is still empty. The stdin is still empty. The value of `prev` is now equal to `i`, which is 2.
