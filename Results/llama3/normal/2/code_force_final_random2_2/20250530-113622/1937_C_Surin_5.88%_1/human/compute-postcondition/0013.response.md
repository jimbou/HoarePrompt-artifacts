The code prints a formatted string containing a question mark and the values of `v1` and `v2`. However, the precondition states that the values of `v1` and `v2` are only assigned if the current value of `r` is '<'. If this condition is not met, the state of the variables remains unchanged, implying that `v1` and `v2` would retain their previous values or remain undefined.

Since the precondition does not explicitly state the value of `r`, we cannot determine the exact values of `v1` and `v2`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output a string in the format '? v1 v1 v2 v2'.

Output: **? v1 v1 v2 v2 (where v1 and v2 are the values of v1 and v2, respectively, which are either 1 and 2 if r is '<', or their previous values if r is not '<')**
