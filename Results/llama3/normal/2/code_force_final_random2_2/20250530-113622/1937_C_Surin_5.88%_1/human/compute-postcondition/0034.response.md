The only variable in the loop head is variable i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **n is at least 3, i is 2, kp is 0, g is 0, v2 is n-1, v1 is n-1, stdin is empty, and if r is '>', then prev is 1 and r is '>', otherwise prev is 0.**
