Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

The print statement is `print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')`. This is a formatted string that will be printed to the console.

The variables `v1` and `v2` are used in the print statement. According to the precondition, `v2` is always 2.

The value of `v1` depends on the user's input `r`. If the user inputs '<', then `v1` is 1. If the user inputs anything else, `v1` remains 0.

Since the precondition states that the console contains "! [prev] [v1]" followed by "? 0 0 1 1", we can infer that the user has already input '<' at some point, because `v1` is 1 in the console output. Therefore, when the print statement is executed, `v1` will be 1.

So, the print statement will output a string with `v1` being 1 and `v2` being 2.

Output: **? 1 1 2 2**
