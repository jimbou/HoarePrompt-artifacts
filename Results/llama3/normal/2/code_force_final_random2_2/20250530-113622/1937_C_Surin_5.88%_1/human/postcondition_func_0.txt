The function reads a series of integers from standard input, where each integer represents the number of elements in a sequence. For each sequence, it performs a series of comparisons and outputs the indices of the maximum element in the sequence. The function iterates over multiple sequences, as specified by the initial input, and outputs the results for each sequence.
