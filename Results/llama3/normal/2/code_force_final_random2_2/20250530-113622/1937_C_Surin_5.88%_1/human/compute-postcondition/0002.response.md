The code snippet reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, then initializes `g` and `v1` to 0. The value of `n` is greater than 0, as specified in the precondition. The value of `kp` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, kp is 0, g is 0, v1 is 0, stdin is empty**
