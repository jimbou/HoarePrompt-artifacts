According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2. Also, the variable `i` is introduced in the loop head, so its state needs to be adjusted as well. Since the loop starts from 1, `i` should be 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `stdin` is empty**
