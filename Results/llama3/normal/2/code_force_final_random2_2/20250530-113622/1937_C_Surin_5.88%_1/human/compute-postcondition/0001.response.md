To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head involves the variable `kp` and the expression `int(input())`. Since `kp` is defined within the loop, its state is dependent on the execution of the loop, which in turn depends on the value of `int(input())`.

Given that `stdin` contains one input: an integer (greater than 0), we can infer that `int(input())` will yield a positive integer. For the loop to execute at least once, this integer must be greater than 0.

The functions `I` and `R` are not directly involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **stdin contains one input: an integer (greater than 0), `kp` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
