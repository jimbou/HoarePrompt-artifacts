Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, g is 0, v1 is 0, i is 1, kp is 2, v2 is 1, prev is n-1, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains the same text as before, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1"**

The first line flushes the output buffer, which means that any pending output is immediately written to the console. Since the console already contains the same text as before, this line does not change the console's content. The second line reads an empty string from stdin and assigns it to the variable `r`. Since stdin is empty, `r` becomes an empty string. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.
