To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 3. To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `n` is at least 3, it must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0, `v2` is n-1, `v1` is n-1, `r` is a string containing a single character, `stdin` is empty. If `r` is '>', then `prev` is 2. Otherwise, `prev` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `r`.**
