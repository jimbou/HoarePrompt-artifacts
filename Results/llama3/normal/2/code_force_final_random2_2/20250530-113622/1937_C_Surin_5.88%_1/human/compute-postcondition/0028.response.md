The code prints a formatted string containing four values: `v1`, `i`, `v1`, and `prev`. Based on the initial state, we can determine the values of these variables.

`v1` is equal to `n-1`, where `n` is at least 2. So, `v1` is at least 1.

`i` is equal to 1.

`prev` is equal to 0.

Therefore, the output will be a string containing the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1`, and `prev`, which are at least 1, 1, at least 1, and 0, respectively.

Output: **? [at least 1] 1 [at least 1] 0**
