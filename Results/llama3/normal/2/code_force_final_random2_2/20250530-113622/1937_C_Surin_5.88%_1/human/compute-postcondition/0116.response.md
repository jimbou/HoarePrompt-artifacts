To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables in the state, such as `g`, `v1`, `kp`, `v2`, `prev`, `r`, `stdin`, the output buffer, and the console, are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is 2 if `r` == '<', otherwise `v1` is 0, `i` is 3, `kp` is 2, `v2` is 2, `prev` is `n-1`, `r` is an empty string, `stdin` contains an empty string, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains the same text as before plus the string "? 0 0 1 1".**
