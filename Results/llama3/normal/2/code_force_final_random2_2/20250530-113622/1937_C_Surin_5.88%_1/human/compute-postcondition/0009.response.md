Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `v2` is 1, stdin contains 1 input: an empty string, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", and the current value of `r` is '<'.**

In this output state, the value of `v1` has been updated to be equal to `v2`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The input in stdin is still an empty string, and the printed output and the value of `r` are also unchanged.
