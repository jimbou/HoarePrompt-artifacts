The code prints a formatted string containing a question mark, two occurrences of the value of `v1`, and two occurrences of the value of `v2`. The value of `v1` is 0 if `r` is not '<', otherwise it is 1. However, the value of `r` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can't determine the exact value of `v1`. The value of `v2` is 2.

Output: **? [v1] [v1] 2 2 (where v1 is either 0 or 1, depending on the value of r)**
