Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0 if `r` != '<', otherwise `v1` is 1, `i` is 2, `kp` is 2, `v2` is 2, `prev` is `n-1`, `stdin` contains an empty string, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains the same text as before, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1"**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `v2` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged. The console still contains the same text as before, and the output buffer is still empty. The input buffer is also empty, and the printed text remains the same.
