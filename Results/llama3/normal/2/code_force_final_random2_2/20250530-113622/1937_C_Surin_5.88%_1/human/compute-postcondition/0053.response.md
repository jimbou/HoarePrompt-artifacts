Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v2` is 1, `stdin` is empty, and the output buffer contains "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either `n-1` if `r` is '>' or either 0, 1, 2, ..., or `n-2` depending on the value of `r`, and `v1` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `v2` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer still contains the same message, with `prev` depending on the value of `r` and `v1` being 0.
