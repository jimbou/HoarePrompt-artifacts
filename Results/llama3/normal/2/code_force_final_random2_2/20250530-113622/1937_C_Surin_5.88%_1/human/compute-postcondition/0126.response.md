Based on the initial state, let's break down the variables and objects involved in the print statement:

* `v1`: This variable is set to `n-1` if all `r` == '<', otherwise it's 0. Since the initial state doesn't specify the value of `r`, we can't determine the exact value of `v1`. However, we can describe it as "either `n-1` or 0, depending on the value of `r`".
* `i`: This variable is set to 1.
* `prev`: This variable is set to 0.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')`

The print statement uses an f-string to format the output. The variables `v1`, `i`, and `prev` are inserted into the string using curly braces `{}`.

Based on the values of the variables, the output will be:

Output: **? [either n-1 or 0, depending on the value of r] 1 [either n-1 or 0, depending on the value of r] 0**

Note that the value of `v1` is described as "either `n-1` or 0, depending on the value of `r`", since we can't determine its exact value based on the initial state.
