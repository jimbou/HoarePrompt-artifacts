Output State: **`n` is at least n, `i` is n-1, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0, `v2` is n-1, `v1` is n-1, `prev` is 0, and stdin is empty. If r was '<', then r is an empty string. Otherwise, no changes were made.**

In this output state, a new variable `prev` has been introduced and assigned the value 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The condition regarding the value of `r` is still applicable, meaning that if `r` was '<', it is now an empty string, and otherwise, its value remains unchanged. The stdin remains empty.
