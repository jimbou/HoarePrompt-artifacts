Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

The print statement is: `print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')`

From the precondition, we know that:

* `v1` is 0
* `v2` is 1

So, when the print statement is executed, it will print the string `'? 0 0 1 1'`.

Here's the explanation:

* `?` is a literal character printed as is.
* `{v1}` is replaced with the value of `v1`, which is 0.
* `{v1}` is again replaced with the value of `v1`, which is 0.
* `{v2}` is replaced with the value of `v2`, which is 1.
* `{v2}` is again replaced with the value of `v2`, which is 1.

Therefore, the output will be the string `'? 0 0 1 1'`.

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
