Output State: **n is greater than or equal to n, i is n, g is 0, kp is 1, v2 is n-1, prev is n-1, stdin is empty, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains "! [prev] [v1]" followed by "? 0 0 1 1", followed by "? [v1] [v1] 2 2", followed by "? [v1] [v1] 3 3", ..., followed by "? [v1] [v1] (n-1) (n-1)". If r is '<', then v1 is n-1. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `n` remains the same as the initial state.
* The value of `i` is now equal to `n`.
* The value of `g` remains 0.
* The value of `kp` remains 1.
* The value of `v2` remains `n-1`.
* The value of `prev` is now `n-1`.
* The `stdin` is empty.
* The output buffer is empty.
* The console contains a series of lines starting with "! [prev] [v1]" followed by "? 0 0 1 1", then "? [v1] [v1] 2 2", then "? [v1] [v1] 3 3", and so on until "? [v1] [v1] (n-1) (n-1)".
* If the input character `r` is '<', then the value of `v1` is `n-1`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.
