Output State: **n is at least 4, i is 3, kp is 0, g is 0, v2 is 3, stdin is empty. If r is '<', then r is an empty string and v1 is equal to v2. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In this output state, the value of `v2` has been updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `r`, `v1`, and `v2` are still valid. The stdin is still empty.
