Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v2` is 3, `v1` is 3, `r` is either 0 or 1, stdin is empty, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains "! [prev] [v1]" followed by "? 0 0 1 1", followed by "? [v1] [v1] 2 2", followed by "? [v1] [v1] 3 3".**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `v1` is now equal to `v2`, which is 3. All other variables remain unchanged. The console still contains the same text, and the output buffer and stdin are still empty. The value of `r` is still dependent on the user's input, and can be either 0 or 1.
