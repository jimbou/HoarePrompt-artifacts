Output State: **`n` is at least n, `i` is n-1, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0, `v2` is n-1, `v1` is n-1, stdin is empty, and if `r` is '>', then `prev` is n-1 and `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n-2 depending on the value of `r`, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is either n-1 if `r` is '>' or either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n-2 depending on the value of `r`, and `v1` is n-1, and the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the output buffer is flushed, meaning that any pending output is immediately displayed. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
