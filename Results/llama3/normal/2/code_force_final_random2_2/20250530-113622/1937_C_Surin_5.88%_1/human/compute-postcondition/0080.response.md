Postcondition: ***n is greater than 1, i is 1, g is 0, kp is 1, the current value of v2 is n-1, prev is 0, stdin contains 1 input: a character, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains "! [prev] [v1]" followed by "? 0 0 1 1", followed by "? [v1] [v1] 2 2", followed by "? [v1] [v1] 3 3", ..., followed by "? [v1] [v1] (n-1) (n-1)", followed by "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is n-1 if r is '<', otherwise the state of the program remains unchanged. The current value of r is '>'***
