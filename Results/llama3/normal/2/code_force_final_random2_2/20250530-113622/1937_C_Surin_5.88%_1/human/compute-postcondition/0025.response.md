Output State: **n is at least n, i is n-1, kp is 0, g is 0, v2 is n-1, v1 is n-1, and stdin is empty. If r was '<', then r is an empty string. Otherwise, no changes were made.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variables have reached their final values. The value of `n` remains unchanged, `i` has reached `n-1`, `kp` and `g` are still 0, `v2` and `v1` have both reached `n-1`, and the standard input is empty. If the input `r` was '<' during the last iteration, it is now an empty string; otherwise, no changes were made to `r`.
