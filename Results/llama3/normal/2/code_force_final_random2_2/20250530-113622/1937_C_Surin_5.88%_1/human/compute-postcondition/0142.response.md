Output State: **n is an integer greater than 3, g is 0, v1 is 0 if r is '>', otherwise v1 is n-1, i is 3, kp is 2, v2 is n-1, prev is 3, stdin is empty, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains the same text as before plus the string "? 0 0 1 1" repeated n-1 times, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is either n-1 or 0 depending on the value of r, i is 3, and prev is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `prev` has been updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The console output still contains the repeated string "? 0 0 1 1" n-1 times, and the last printed line is "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" with the updated value of `prev`.
