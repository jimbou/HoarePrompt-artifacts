Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0 if `r` is '>', otherwise `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `kp` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `n-1` if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is 0, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains the same text as before plus the string "? 0 0 1 1" repeated `n-1` times, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where `v1` is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `r`, `i` is `n`, and `prev` is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `r`, `r` is a string containing the input from stdin, and the string "! [prev] [v1]" is printed where `prev` is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `r`, and `v1` is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `r`, and the output buffer is flushed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, which means that any pending output is immediately written to the console. In this case, the output buffer is empty, so there is no change to the console output. The values of the variables remain the same, and the console still contains the same text as before, including the repeated string "? 0 0 1 1" and the printed strings "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" and "! [prev] [v1]". The only change is that the output buffer is now guaranteed to be empty.
