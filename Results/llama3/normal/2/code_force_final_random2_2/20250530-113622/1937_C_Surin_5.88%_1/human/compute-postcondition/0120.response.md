Output State: **n is an integer greater than 3, g is 0, v1 is 2 if r == '<', otherwise v1 is 0, i is 3, kp is 2, v2 is 3, prev is n-1, r is an empty string, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains the same text as before plus the string "? 0 0 1 1", and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1"**

The first line, `sys.stdout.flush()`, clears the output buffer, but since the output buffer is already empty, this line has no effect. The second line, `r = input('')`, assigns an empty string to `r` because `stdin` contains an empty string. This means that `v1` will be 0 since `r` is not equal to '<'. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.
