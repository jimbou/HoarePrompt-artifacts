Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer read from stdin, g is 0, v1 is 0, i is n-1, kp is 1, v2 is n-1, stdin is empty, and the output buffer contains "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either n-1 if r is '>' or either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n-2 depending on the value of r, and v1 is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    v2 = i
    print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    r = input('')
    if r == '<':
        v1 = v2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The program's state after executing the if-else block is as follows: `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v2` is 1, `stdin` is empty, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains "! [prev] [v1]" followed by "? 0 0 1 1". If the user's input `r` is '<', then `v1` is 1 and `prev` is `n-1`. If the user's input `r` is not '<', then the state remains unchanged from the precondition, with `v1` being 0 and `prev` being either `n-1` or a value between 0 and `n-2` depending on the value of `r`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is at least 2, i is 2, g is 0, kp is 1, v2 is 2, stdin is empty, the output buffer is empty, the console contains "! [prev] [v1]" followed by "? 0 0 1 1", followed by "? [v1] [v1] 2 2", and r is either 0 or 1 depending on the user's input. If r is '<', the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is at least 3, i is 3, g is 0, kp is 1, v2 is 3, stdin is empty, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains "! [prev] [v1]" followed by "? 0 0 1 1", followed by "? [v1] [v1] 2 2", followed by "? [v1] [v1] 3 3". If r is '<', then v1 is 3. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
