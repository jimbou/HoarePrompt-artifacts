The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 2.
State: **n is greater than 2, i is 2, g is 0, kp is 1, stdin contains 1 input: a character, the output buffer is empty. If r is '>', then prev is 1, v2 is n-1, and the console contains "! [1] [n-1]" followed by "? 0 0 1 1", followed by "? [n-1] [n-1] 2 2", followed by "? [n-1] [n-1] 3 3", ..., followed by "? [n-1] [n-1] (n-1) (n-1)", followed by "? [n-1] [1] [n-1] [1]". If r is not '>', then prev is 0, v2 is n-1, and the console contains "! [prev] [v1]" followed by "? 0 0 1 1", followed by "? [v1] [v1] 2 2", followed by "? [v1] [v1] 3 3", ..., followed by "? [v1] [v1] (n-1) (n-1)", followed by "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is n-1 if r is '<', otherwise the state of the program remains unchanged.**
