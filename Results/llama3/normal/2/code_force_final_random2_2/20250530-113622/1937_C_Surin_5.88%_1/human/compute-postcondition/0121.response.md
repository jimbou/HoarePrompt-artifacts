Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is 3, `i` is 3, `kp` is 2, `v2` is 3, `prev` is `n-1`, `r` is an empty string, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains the same text as before plus the string "? 0 0 1 1", and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1"**

In this output state, the value of `v1` has been updated to 3, which is the value of `v2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The console and output buffer still contain the same text as before, and the stdin is still empty.
