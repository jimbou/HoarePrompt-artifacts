Postcondition: ***n is at least 2, i is 2, g is 0, kp is 1, v2 is 2, stdin is empty, the output buffer is empty, the console contains "! [prev] [v1]" followed by "? 0 0 1 1", followed by "? [v1] [v1] 2 2", and r is either 0 or 1 depending on the user's input. If r is '<', the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
