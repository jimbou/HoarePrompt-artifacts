Based on the initial state, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `prev` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n-2 depending on the value of `r`, or `n-1` if `r` is '>'.
* `v1` is `n-1`.

The print statement is a formatted string that includes the values of `prev` and `v1`. Therefore, the output will be a string that includes the value of `prev` and `v1`.

Output: **! [prev] [n-1] (where prev is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n-2 depending on the value of r, or n-1 if r is '>', and n-1 is the value of v1)**
