Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, g is 0, v1 is 0 if r is '>', otherwise v1 is n-1, i is n, kp is 2, v2 is n-1, prev is n-1 if r is '>', otherwise prev is 0, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains the same text as before plus the string "? 0 0 1 1" repeated n-1 times, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is either n-1 or 0 depending on the value of r, i is n, and prev is either n-1 or 0 depending on the value of r, r is a string containing the input from stdin**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

The loop has finished executing, and the state of the variables has been updated accordingly. The value of `i` has reached `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `prev` is either `n-1` if the last input `r` was '>', or 0 if the last input `r` was '<'. The value of `v1` is either `n-1` if all inputs `r` were '<', or 0 if any input `r` was '>'. The other variables `g`, `kp`, and `v2` remain unchanged. The console contains the same text as before, plus the string "? 0 0 1 1" repeated `n-1` times, and the last printed line is "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where `v1` is either `n-1` or 0, `i` is `n`, and `prev` is either `n-1` or 0.
