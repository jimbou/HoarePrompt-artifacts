Output State: **n is greater than 1, i is 1, g is 0, kp is 1, v2 is n-1, prev is 0, stdin contains 1 input: a character, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains "! [prev] [v1]" followed by "? 0 0 1 1", followed by "? [v1] [v1] 2 2", followed by "? [v1] [v1] 3 3", ..., followed by "? [v1] [v1] (n-1) (n-1)", followed by "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is n-1 if r is '<', otherwise the state of the program remains unchanged.**

The first line flushes the output buffer, which is already empty, so it has no effect. The second line reads a character from stdin and assigns it to r. Since stdin is empty, it will wait for input. The state of the program remains unchanged until a character is entered. If the entered character is '<', then v1 becomes n-1, otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.
