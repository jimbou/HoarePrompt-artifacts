Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, g is 0, v1 is 1, i is 1, kp is 2, v2 is 1, prev is n-1, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains the same text as before, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1". The current value of r is '<'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `v1` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `v2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The console still contains the same text as before, and the output buffer is still empty. The current value of `r` is still '<'.
