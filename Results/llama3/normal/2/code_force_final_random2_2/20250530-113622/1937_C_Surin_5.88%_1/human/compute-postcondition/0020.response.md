To determine what will be printed when the given `print` statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State:
- `n` is at least 4.
- `i` is 3.
- `kp` is 0.
- `g` is 0.
- `v2` is 3.
- `stdin` is empty.
- If `r` is '<', then `r` is an empty string and `v1` is equal to `v2`. Otherwise, no changes are made.

Given Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Since the value of `r` is not explicitly provided in the initial state, we have two scenarios based on the condition related to `r`:

1. **If `r` is '<'**:
   - `r` becomes an empty string.
   - `v1` is equal to `v2`, which means `v1` is also 3.

2. **If `r` is not '<'**:
   - No changes are made, so we cannot determine the value of `v1` from the given information. However, we know `v2` is 3.

Given the uncertainty about `r` and consequently `v1`, we can describe the output in terms of the conditions:

- If `r` is '<', then `v1` equals `v2` (which is 3), so the output would be: `? 3 3 3 3`.
- If `r` is not '<', we cannot determine `v1`, but we know `v2` is 3. Thus, the output would be in the format `? [v1] [v1] 3 3`, where `[v1]` represents the unknown value of `v1`.

Since we cannot definitively determine the value of `v1` without knowing the value of `r`, the most precise description of the output, given the initial state, is conditional.

Output: **? [v1] [v1] 3 3 (where [v1] equals 3 if r is '<', otherwise [v1] is unknown)**
