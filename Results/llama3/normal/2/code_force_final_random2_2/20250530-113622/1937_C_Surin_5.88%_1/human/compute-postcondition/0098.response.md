Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `n`, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `n-1`, stdin is empty, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains "! [prev] [v1]" followed by "? 0 0 1 1", followed by "? [v1] [v1] 2 2", followed by "? [v1] [v1] 3 3", ..., followed by "? [v1] [v1] (n-1) (n-1)", and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is n-1 and v1 is n-1 if r is '<', otherwise the state of the program remains unchanged, and the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the output buffer is flushed. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `g`, `kp`, `v2`, and `prev` remain unchanged. The console still contains the same output, and the output buffer is now empty. The only change is that the output buffer is flushed, which means that any pending output is sent to the console.
