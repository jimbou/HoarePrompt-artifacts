Output State: **n is an integer read from stdin, g is 0, v1 is 0, i is n-1, kp is 1, v2 is n-1, stdin is empty, and the output buffer contains "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either n-1 if r is '>' or either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n-2 depending on the value of r, and v1 is 0.**

In this final state, the value of `n` is updated to the integer read from stdin, `g` is reset to 0, and `v1` is set to 0. The values of `i`, `kp`, and `v2` remain unchanged. The output buffer still contains the printed message "! [prev] [v1]" with the updated value of `v1` as 0. The stdin is empty after reading the integer value for `n`.
