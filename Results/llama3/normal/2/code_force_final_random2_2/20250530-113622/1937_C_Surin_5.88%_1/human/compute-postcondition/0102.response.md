Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 1, `kp` is 2, `v2` is 1, `prev` is `n-1`, `stdin` is empty, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains the same text as before.**

In this output state, the value of `v2` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin, output buffer, and console state also remain the same.
