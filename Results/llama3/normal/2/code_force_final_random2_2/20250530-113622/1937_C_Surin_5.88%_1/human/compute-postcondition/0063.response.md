Based on the precondition, the postcondition can be calculated as follows:

The code prints a formatted string containing the values of `v1` and `v2`. Since `v1` is either 0 or 1 depending on the user's input `r`, and `v2` is always 2, the printed string will be either "? 0 0 2 2" or "? 1 1 2 2".

Output: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v2` is 2, `stdin` is empty, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains "! [prev] [v1]" followed by "? 0 0 1 1", and this is printed: "? [v1] [v1] 2 2" where [v1] is either 0 or 1 depending on the user's input `r`**
