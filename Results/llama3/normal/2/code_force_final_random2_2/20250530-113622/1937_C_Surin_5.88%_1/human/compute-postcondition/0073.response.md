Postcondition: ***n is at least 3, i is 3, g is 0, kp is 1, v2 is 3, stdin is empty, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains "! [prev] [v1]" followed by "? 0 0 1 1", followed by "? [v1] [v1] 2 2", followed by "? [v1] [v1] 3 3". If r is '<', then v1 is 3. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
