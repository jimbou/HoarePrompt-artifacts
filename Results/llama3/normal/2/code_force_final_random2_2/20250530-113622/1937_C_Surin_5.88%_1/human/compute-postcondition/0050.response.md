To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for kp in range(int(input())):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `kp` is within the range of the input value.

At the end of the previous iteration, `kp` is 0, and the input value is at least `n`. For the loop to execute again, `kp` must be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is at least n, `i` is n-1, `kp` is 1, `g` is 0, `v2` is n-1, `v1` is n-1, stdin is empty, and if `r` is '>', then `prev` is n-1 and `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n-2 depending on the value of `r`, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is either n-1 if `r` is '>' or either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n-2 depending on the value of `r`, and `v1` is n-1, and the output buffer is flushed.**
