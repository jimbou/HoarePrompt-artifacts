Output State: **n is at least 2, i is 1, kp is 0, g is 0, v1 is 0, v2 is 1, stdin contains 1 input: an empty string, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1"**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line, `sys.stdout.flush()`, ensures that any buffered output is immediately written to the standard output. Since the initial state already includes the printed output "? 0 0 1 1", this line does not change the output state.

The second line, `r = input('')`, reads an empty string from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `r`. Since the initial state specifies that `stdin` is empty, this line does not modify any variables. However, it does change the state of `stdin` to contain 1 input: an empty string.

The values of `n`, `i`, `kp`, `g`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code snippet.
