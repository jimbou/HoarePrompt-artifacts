Output: **n is at least n, i is n-1, kp is 0, g is 0, v2 is n-1, v1 is n-1, stdin is empty, and if r is '>', then prev is n-1 and r is '>', otherwise prev is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n-2 depending on the value of r., and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either n-1 if r is '>' or either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n-2 depending on the value of r, and v1 is n-1**
