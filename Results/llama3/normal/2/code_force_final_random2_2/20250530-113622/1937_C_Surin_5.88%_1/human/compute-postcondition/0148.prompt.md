Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains one input: an integer (greater than 0), I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer.
Code of the loop:
for kp in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    g = 0
    v1 = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        v2 = i
        print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r = input('')
        if r == '<':
            v1 = v2
    prev = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r = input()
        if r == '>':
            prev = i
    print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
    sys.stdout.flush()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least n, `i` is n-1, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0, `v2` is n-1, `v1` is n-1, stdin is empty, and if `r` is '>', then `prev` is n-1 and `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n-2 depending on the value of `r`, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is either n-1 if `r` is '>' or either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n-2 depending on the value of `r`, and `v1` is n-1, and the output buffer is flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `n`, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `n-1`, stdin is empty, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains "! [prev] [v1]" followed by "? 0 0 1 1", followed by "? [v1] [v1] 2 2", followed by "? [v1] [v1] 3 3", ..., followed by "? [v1] [v1] (n-1) (n-1)", and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is n-1 and v1 is n-1 if r is '<', otherwise the state of the program remains unchanged, and the output buffer is flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0 if `r` is '>', otherwise `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `kp` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `n-1` if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is 0, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains the same text as before plus the string "? 0 0 1 1" repeated `n-1` times, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where `v1` is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `r`, `i` is `n`, and `prev` is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `r`, `r` is a string containing the input from stdin, and the string "! [prev] [v1]" is printed where `prev` is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `r`, and `v1` is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `r`, and the output buffer is flushed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
