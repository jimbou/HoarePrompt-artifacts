Output: **n is greater than or equal to n, i is n, g is 0, kp is 1, v2 is n-1, prev is n-1, stdin is empty, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains "! [prev] [v1]" followed by "? 0 0 1 1", followed by "? [v1] [v1] 2 2", followed by "? [v1] [v1] 3 3", ..., followed by "? [v1] [v1] (n-1) (n-1)", and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is n-1 and v1 is n-1 if r is '<', otherwise the state of the program remains unchanged**
