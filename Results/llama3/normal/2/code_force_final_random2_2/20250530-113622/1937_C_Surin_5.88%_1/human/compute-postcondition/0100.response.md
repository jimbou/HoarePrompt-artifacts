Output State: **n is an integer equal to the input value, g is 0, v1 is 0, i is n, kp is 2, v2 is n-1, prev is n-1, stdin is empty, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains the same text as before.**

The code snippet does not modify the values of `i`, `kp`, `v2`, or `prev`, so they remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `n` is updated to the integer value read from the input, which is now empty. The variables `g` and `v1` are assigned the value 0. The console and output buffer remain unchanged.
