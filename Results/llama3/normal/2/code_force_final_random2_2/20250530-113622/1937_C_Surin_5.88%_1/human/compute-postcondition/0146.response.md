Output: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, g is 0, v1 is 0 if r is '>', otherwise v1 is n-1, i is n, kp is 2, v2 is n-1, prev is n-1 if r is '>', otherwise prev is 0, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains the same text as before plus the string "? 0 0 1 1" repeated n-1 times, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is either n-1 or 0 depending on the value of r, i is n, and prev is either n-1 or 0 depending on the value of r, r is a string containing the input from stdin, and the string "! [prev] [v1]" is printed where prev is either n-1 or 0 depending on the value of r, and v1 is either n-1 or 0 depending on the value of r**
