The code prints a formatted string containing a question mark, the value of `v1` (which is `n-1`), the value of `i` (which is 2), the value of `v1` again (which is `n-1`), and the value of `prev` (which is 1 if `r` is '>' and 0 otherwise).

Since `n` is at least 3, `v1` and `v2` are both `n-1`, which is at least 2.

The value of `prev` depends on the value of `r`. If `r` is '>', then `prev` is 1, otherwise `prev` is 0.

Output: **? [n-1] 2 [n-1] [prev] (where n is at least 3, and prev is 1 if r is '>' and 0 otherwise)**
