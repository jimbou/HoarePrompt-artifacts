Output State: **n is at least 2, i is 1, g is 0, v1 is 1, kp is 1, v2 is 1, stdin is empty, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is `n-1`, and `v1` is 1, followed by "? 0 0 1 1", and r is a string containing the user's input which is '<'.**

In this output state, the value of `v1` has been updated to 1, which is the value of `v2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The console output has also been updated to reflect the new value of `v1`.
