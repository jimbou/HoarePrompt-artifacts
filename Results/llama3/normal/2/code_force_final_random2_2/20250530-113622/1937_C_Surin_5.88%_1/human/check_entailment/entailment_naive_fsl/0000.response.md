Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and uses the allowed queries to find the pair of indices i and j such that p_i âŠ• p_j is maximized.

The program first finds the index v1 of the maximum value in the permutation p by comparing each pair of elements (v1, v1) and (i, i) for i from 1 to n-1. This is done using the query "? v1 v1 i i" and checking the result. If the result is '<', it means that (p_v1 | p_v1) < (p_i | p_i), so v1 is updated to i.

Then, the program finds the index prev of the maximum value in the permutation p that is not equal to v1. This is done by comparing each pair of elements (v1, i) and (v1, prev) for i from 1 to n-1. This is done using the query "? v1 i v1 prev" and checking the result. If the result is '>', it means that (p_v1 | p_i) > (p_v1 | p_prev), so prev is updated to i.

Finally, the program prints the pair of indices prev and v1, which are the indices of the maximum and minimum values in the permutation p, respectively.

The program uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit. The program also correctly handles the case where n = 2, in which case it only needs to make one query to find the pair of indices.

Overall, the program is correct and follows the problem description.
