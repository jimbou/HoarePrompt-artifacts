Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, g is 0, v1 is 0, i is 1, kp is 2, v2 is n-1, prev is 1, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains the same text as before plus the string "? 0 0 1 1" repeated n-1 times, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is 0, i is 1, and prev is 1, r is a string containing the input from stdin and the current value of r is '>'**

In this output state, the value of `prev` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The console still contains the same text as before, with the string "? 0 0 1 1" repeated n-1 times, and the output buffer is still empty. The stdin is still empty, and the value of `r` is still '>'.
