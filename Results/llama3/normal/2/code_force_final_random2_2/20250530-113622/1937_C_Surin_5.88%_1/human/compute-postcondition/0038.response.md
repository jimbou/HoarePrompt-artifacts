Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `r` is a string containing a single character, `prev` is 2, and stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `prev` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin is still empty.
