Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0, `r` is an empty string, `v1` is equal to `v2`, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `kp`, `g`, and `r` remain unchanged. The only change is that `v1` is now equal to `v2`, but since the initial value of `v2` is not specified, we can only conclude that `v1` is equal to `v2`, without knowing their actual values. The stdin remains empty.
