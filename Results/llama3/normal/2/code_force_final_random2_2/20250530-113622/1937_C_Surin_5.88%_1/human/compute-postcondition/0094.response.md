Postcondition: ***n is greater than 3, i is 3, g is 0, kp is 1, stdin is empty, the output buffer is empty, r is a character, if r is '>', then prev is 3 and the console contains a series of lines depending on the value of r, and this is printed: "? [v1] [3] [v1] [3]" where v1 is not defined in the precondition. If r is not '>', then prev is either 0 or 1 and the console contains a series of lines depending on the value of r, and this is printed: "? [v1] [3] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is not defined in the precondition.***
