Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `stdin` is empty, the output buffer is empty, `r` is a character, `prev` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, and the console contains a series of lines depending on the value of `r`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 2, `i` remains 2, `g` is still 0, `kp` is still 1, `stdin` is still empty, the output buffer is still empty, `r` is still a character, `prev` has been updated to 2 (which is the current value of `i`), `v2` is still `n-1`, and the console still contains a series of lines depending on the value of `r`.
