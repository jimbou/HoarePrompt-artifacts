Output State: **n is at least 3, i is 2, kp is 0, g is 0, if the current value of r is '<', then v1 is 1 and v2 is 2, stdin contains 1 input: an empty string, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1". Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `v2` has been updated to `i`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition related to the value of `r` still applies, and the print statement remains the same.
