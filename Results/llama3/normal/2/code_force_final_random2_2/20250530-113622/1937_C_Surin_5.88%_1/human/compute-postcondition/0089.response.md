To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `n` is greater than 2, it must also be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables in the state, such as `g`, `kp`, `stdin`, `r`, `prev`, `v2`, and the console, are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `stdin` is empty, the output buffer is empty, `r` is a character, if `r` is '>', then `prev` is 2, otherwise `prev` is either 0 or 1, `v2` is `n-1`, and the console contains a series of lines depending on the value of `r`.**
