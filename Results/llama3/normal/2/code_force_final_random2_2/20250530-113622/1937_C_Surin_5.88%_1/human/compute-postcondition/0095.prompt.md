Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is at least n, `i` is n, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v2` is n-1, `prev` is 0, stdin is empty, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains "! [prev] [v1]" followed by "? 0 0 1 1", followed by "? [v1] [v1] 2 2", followed by "? [v1] [v1] 3 3", ..., followed by "? [v1] [v1] (n-1) (n-1)". If r is '<', then v1 is n-1. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    r = input()
    if r == '>':
        prev = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is greater than 1, i is 1, g is 0, kp is 1, stdin contains 1 input: a character, the output buffer is empty. If r is '>', then prev is 1, v2 is n-1, and the console contains "! [1] [n-1]" followed by "? 0 0 1 1", followed by "? [n-1] [n-1] 2 2", followed by "? [n-1] [n-1] 3 3", ..., followed by "? [n-1] [n-1] (n-1) (n-1)", followed by "? [n-1] [1] [n-1] [1]". If r is not '>', then prev is 0, v2 is n-1, and the console contains "! [prev] [v1]" followed by "? 0 0 1 1", followed by "? [v1] [v1] 2 2", followed by "? [v1] [v1] 3 3", ..., followed by "? [v1] [v1] (n-1) (n-1)", followed by "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is n-1 if r is '<', otherwise the state of the program remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `stdin` is empty, the output buffer is empty, `r` is a character, if `r` is '>', then `prev` is 2, otherwise `prev` is either 0 or 1, `v2` is `n-1`, and the console contains a series of lines depending on the value of `r`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is greater than 3, i is 3, g is 0, kp is 1, stdin is empty, the output buffer is empty, r is a character, if r is '>', then prev is 3 and the console contains a series of lines depending on the value of r, and this is printed: "? [v1] [3] [v1] [3]" where v1 is not defined in the precondition. If r is not '>', then prev is either 0 or 1 and the console contains a series of lines depending on the value of r, and this is printed: "? [v1] [3] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is not defined in the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
