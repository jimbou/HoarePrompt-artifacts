Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, g is 0, v1 is n-1 if all r == '<', otherwise v1 is 0, i is 1, kp is 2, v2 is n-1, prev is 0, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains the same text as before plus the string "? 0 0 1 1" repeated n-1 times, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is either n-1 or 0 depending on the value of r, i is 1, and prev is 0, r is a string containing the input from stdin**.

The first line, `sys.stdout.flush()`, clears the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is immediately displayed on the console. This does not affect any variables but ensures that the console output is up-to-date.

The second line, `r = input()`, reads a line from stdin and assigns it to the variable `r`. Since stdin contains an empty string, `r` will be an empty string. This line does not affect any other variables.

The initial state's conditions and variables that are not modified by the code (`n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, `kp`, `v2`, `prev`) remain unchanged. The console output is updated as described, with the string "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" printed, where `v1` is either `n-1` or `0` depending on the value of `r`, `i` is `1`, and `prev` is `0`. The output buffer is empty after the first line's execution.
