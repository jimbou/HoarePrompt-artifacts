Based on the precondition, the print statement will print a string in the format '? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]'.

Here's a breakdown of the values:

*   `v1` is either `n-1` or `0`, depending on the value of `r`. If `r` is '<', `v1` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `v1` is `0`.
*   `i` is `3`.
*   `prev` is either `2` or `0`, depending on the value of `r`. If `r` is '>', `prev` is `2`. Otherwise, `prev` is `0`.

So, the output will be a string in the format '? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]', where `v1` is either `n-1` or `0`, `i` is `3`, and `prev` is either `2` or `0`.

Output: **? [n-1 or 0] 3 [n-1 or 0] [2 or 0]**
