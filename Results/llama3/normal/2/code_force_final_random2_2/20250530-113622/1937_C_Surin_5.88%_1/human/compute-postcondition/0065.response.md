Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v1` is 2, `v2` is 2, stdin is empty, the output buffer is empty, the console contains "! [prev] [v1]" followed by "? 0 0 1 1", followed by "? [v1] [v1] 2 2", and `r` is either 0 or 1 depending on the user's input.**

In this output state, the value of `v1` has been updated to be equal to `v2`, which is 2. The other variables and the console output remain unchanged.
