Postcondition: **The program's state after executing the if-else block is as follows: `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v2` is 1, `stdin` is empty, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains "! [prev] [v1]" followed by "? 0 0 1 1". If the user's input `r` is '<', then `v1` is 1 and `prev` is `n-1`. If the user's input `r` is not '<', then the state remains unchanged from the precondition, with `v1` being 0 and `prev` being either `n-1` or a value between 0 and `n-2` depending on the value of `r`.**
