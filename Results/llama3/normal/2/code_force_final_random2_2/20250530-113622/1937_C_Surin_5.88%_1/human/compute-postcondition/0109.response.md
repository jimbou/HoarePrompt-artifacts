To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0 if `r` != '<', otherwise `v1` is 1, `i` is 2, `kp` is 2, `v2` is 1, `prev` is `n-1`, `stdin` contains an empty string, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains the same text as before, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1".**
