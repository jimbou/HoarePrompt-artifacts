To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1` if all `r` == '<', otherwise `v1` is 0, `i` is 1, `kp` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains the same text as before plus the string "? 0 0 1 1" repeated `n-1` times.**
