To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `i` is equal to `n`, which means the loop will not execute. So, we need to adjust `i` to be less than `n` and `n` to be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 1, `kp` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `n-1`, `stdin` is empty, the output buffer is empty, and the console contains the same text as before.**
