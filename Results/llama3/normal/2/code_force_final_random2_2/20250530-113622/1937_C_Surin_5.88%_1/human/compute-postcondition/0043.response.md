The first line flushes the buffer of sys.stdout, ensuring that any buffered output is immediately written to the output stream. The second line assigns the value of the input to `r`. Since stdin is empty, this line will block until input is provided.

Output State: **n is at least 4, i is 3, kp is 0, g is 0, v2 is n-1, v1 is n-1, r is a string containing a single character, stdin is empty, prev is either 0, 1 or 2 depending on the value of r**
