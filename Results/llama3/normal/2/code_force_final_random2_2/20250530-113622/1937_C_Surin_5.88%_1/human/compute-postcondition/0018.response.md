According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **n is at least 4, i is 3, kp is 0, g is 0, stdin is empty. If r is '<', then r is an empty string and v1 is equal to v2. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
