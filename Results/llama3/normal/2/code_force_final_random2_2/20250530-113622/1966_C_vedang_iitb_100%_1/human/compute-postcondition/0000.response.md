The code `t = int(input())` accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The first input is assigned into t. So stdin now contains t-1 test cases. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: t is an integer larger than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Output State: **t is an integer larger than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**
