Postcondition: ***t is an integer larger than 0, tc is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer greater than 0, a is an empty list, sz is the last integer in the original list, maxsize is the maximum integer in the original list, mexsize is the smallest non-negative integer not in the list. Either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether mexsize is even or odd, regardless of whether mexsize is greater than maxsize or not.***
