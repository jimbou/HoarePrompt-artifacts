Output State: **t is an integer larger than 0, tc is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a sorted list of n integers, maxsize is the maximum integer in a, mexsize is 1.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` remains unchanged, still an integer larger than 0. The value of `tc` also remains unchanged, still 1. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 2, now containing `t-4` test cases. The value of `n` has been updated to a new integer greater than 0, which is the number of elements in the list `a`. The list `a` is now a sorted list of `n` integers, containing the same elements as before but in sorted order. The value of `maxsize` has been updated to the maximum integer in the sorted list `a`. The value of `mexsize` has been reset to 1, which is the smallest positive integer that is not in `a`.
