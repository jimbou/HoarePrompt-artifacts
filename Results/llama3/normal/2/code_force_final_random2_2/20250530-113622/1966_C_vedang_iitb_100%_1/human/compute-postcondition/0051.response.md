Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 1, `tc` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `sz` is the third element in the list `a`, `maxsize` is the maximum integer in the list, `mexsize` is either 4 or not equal to `sz` if `sz` is equal to `mexsize` otherwise `mexsize` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `mexsize` has been incremented by 1. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is either 4 or not equal to `sz`. Otherwise, `mexsize` is increased by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
