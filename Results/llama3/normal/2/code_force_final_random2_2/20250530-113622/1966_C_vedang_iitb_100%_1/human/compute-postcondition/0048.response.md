Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 1, `tc` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `sz` is the second element in the list `a`, `maxsize` is the maximum integer in the list, `mexsize` is either 3 or not equal to `sz`**

In this output state, the value of `mexsize` has been incremented by 1. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is now 3. If `sz` is not equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is still not equal to `sz`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
