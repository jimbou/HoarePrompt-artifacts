Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer larger than 0, `tc` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `maxsize` is the maximum integer in `a`, if the first element in `a` (sz) is equal to 1, then `mexsize` is 2, otherwise `mexsize` is 1.***
