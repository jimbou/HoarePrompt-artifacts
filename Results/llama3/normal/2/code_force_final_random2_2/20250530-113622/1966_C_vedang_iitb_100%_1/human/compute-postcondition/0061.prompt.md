Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer larger than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for tc in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    maxsize = max(a)
    a.sort()
    mexsize = 1
    for sz in a:
        if sz == mexsize:
            mexsize = mexsize + 1
    if mexsize > maxsize:
        print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 0 else 'Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer larger than 0, tc is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a sorted list of n integers, maxsize is the maximum integer in a, mexsize is the smallest positive integer that is not in a. If mexsize is greater than maxsize, either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether mexsize is even or odd. If mexsize is less than or equal to maxsize, the name of the winner of the game is printed which is 'Alice' if mexsize is odd, otherwise it is 'Bob'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer larger than 0, tc is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer greater than 0, a is an empty list, sz is the last integer in the original list, maxsize is the maximum integer in the original list, mexsize is the smallest non-negative integer not in the list. Either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether mexsize is even or odd, regardless of whether mexsize is greater than maxsize or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer larger than 1, `tc` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `maxsize` is the maximum integer in the list, `sz` is the last element in the list `a`, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether `mexsize` is even or odd




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
