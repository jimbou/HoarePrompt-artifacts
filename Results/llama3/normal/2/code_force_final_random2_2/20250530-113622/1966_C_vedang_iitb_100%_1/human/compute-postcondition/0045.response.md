Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 1, `tc` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `sz` is the first element in the list `a`, `maxsize` is the maximum integer in the list, `mexsize` is 2, and the current value of `sz` is not equal to `mexsize`**

In this output state, the value of `mexsize` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The current value of `sz` is no longer equal to `mexsize` because `sz` is still the first element in the list `a`, but `mexsize` has been incremented.
