The only variable in the loop head is variable sz and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a. If the list has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer larger than 0, tc is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer greater than 0, maxsize is the maximum integer in a, mexsize is 1. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and sz is the first integer in the list.
State: **t is an integer larger than 0, tc is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a sorted list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, sz is the first integer in the list, maxsize is the maximum integer in a, mexsize is 1**
