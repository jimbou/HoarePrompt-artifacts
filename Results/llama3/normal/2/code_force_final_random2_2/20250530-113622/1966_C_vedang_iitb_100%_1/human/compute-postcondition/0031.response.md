Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, `tc` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least 3 integers, `sz` is the third integer in the list, `maxsize` is the maximum integer in `a`, `mexsize` is `mexsize + 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `mexsize` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` is still sorted and has at least 3 integers, with `sz` being the third integer in the list and `maxsize` being the maximum integer in `a`. The number of test cases in `stdin` is still `t-4`, and `tc` is still 1.
