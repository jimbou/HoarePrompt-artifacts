To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `tc` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `tc` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `tc` is 0 and `t` is an integer larger than 0. For the loop to execute again, `tc` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, `tc` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `maxsize` is the maximum integer in `a`, `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer that is not in `a`. If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether `mexsize` is even or odd. If `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`, the name of the winner of the game is printed which is 'Alice' if `mexsize` is odd, otherwise it is 'Bob'.**
