State: **`t` is an integer larger than 1, `tc` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, `sz` is the last integer in the original list, `maxsize` is the maximum integer in the original list, `mexsize` is the smallest non-negative integer not in the list. Either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether `mexsize` is even or odd, regardless of whether `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize` or not.**
