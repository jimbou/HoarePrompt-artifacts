To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for sz in a:`, which means the loop will iterate over the elements of list `a`. The current state is:

* `t` is an integer larger than 0
* `tc` is 0
* `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases
* `n` is an integer greater than 0
* `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers
* `maxsize` is the maximum integer in `a`
* If the first element in `a` (sz) is equal to 1, then `mexsize` is 2, otherwise `mexsize` is 1

Since the loop iterates over the elements of `a`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `sz`, which is the current element being processed.

At the end of the previous iteration, `sz` was the first element of `a`. For the loop to execute again, `sz` needs to be the next element in `a`. Since `a` is a sorted list, the next element will be the second element in `a`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, `tc` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `maxsize` is the maximum integer in `a`, `sz` is the second element in `a`, if `sz` is equal to 1, then `mexsize` is 2, otherwise `mexsize` is 1**

Note that the values of `t`, `tc`, `stdin`, `n`, `maxsize`, and `mexsize` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop iteration. Only the value of `sz` is updated to the next element in the list `a`.
