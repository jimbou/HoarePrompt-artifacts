The code prints 'Alice' if the current value of mexsize is even, and 'Bob' if it is odd. Since the precondition states that the current value of mexsize is greater than maxsize, and mexsize is the smallest non-negative integer not in the list, we can infer that mexsize is at least maxsize + 1.

Output: **'Bob'**
