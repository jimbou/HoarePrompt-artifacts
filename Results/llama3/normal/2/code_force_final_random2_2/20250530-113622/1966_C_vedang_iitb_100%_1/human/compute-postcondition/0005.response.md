Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, `tc` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `maxsize` is the maximum integer in `a`, `mexsize` is 2, and the first element in `a` (sz) is equal to 1.**

In this output state, the value of `mexsize` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `mexsize` being equal to 2. All other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still being an integer larger than 0, `tc` remaining 0, `stdin` containing `t-2` test cases, `n` being an integer greater than 0, `a` being a sorted list of `n` integers, `maxsize` being the maximum integer in `a`, and the first element in `a` (sz) still being equal to 1.
