To determine what will be printed when the given statement executes, let's break down the information provided in the initial state and analyze the print statement.

The initial state provides the following information:

- `t` is an integer larger than 0.
- `tc` is 0.
- `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases.
- `n` is an integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers.
- `maxsize` is the maximum integer in `a`.
- `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer that is not in `a`.
- `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')
```
This statement uses a conditional expression to decide what to print. The condition is `mexsize % 2 == 1`, which checks whether `mexsize` is odd (since the remainder of an odd number divided by 2 is 1).

Given the initial state, we know that `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not in the sorted list `a`, and it is less than or equal to `maxsize`. However, we do not know the exact value of `mexsize` because the specific elements of `a` are not provided.

Despite this, we can still describe the output based on the condition:

- If `mexsize` is an odd number, the print statement will output `'Alice'`.
- If `mexsize` is an even number, the print statement will output `'Bob'`.

Since we cannot determine the exact parity (odd or even) of `mexsize` without knowing its value, the output depends on whether `mexsize` is odd or even.

Output: **'Alice' if mexsize is odd, 'Bob' if mexsize is even**
