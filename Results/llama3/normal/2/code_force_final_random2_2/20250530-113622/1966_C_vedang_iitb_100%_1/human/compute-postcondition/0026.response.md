Postcondition: ***t is an integer larger than 0, tc is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a sorted list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, sz is the first integer in the list, maxsize is the maximum integer in a. If sz is equal to mexsize, then mexsize is updated to 2 and sz is not equal to mexsize. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
