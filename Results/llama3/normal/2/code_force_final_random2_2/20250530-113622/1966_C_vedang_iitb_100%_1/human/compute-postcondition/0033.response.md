Output State: **t is an integer larger than 0, tc is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer greater than 0, a is an empty list, sz is the last integer in the original list, maxsize is the maximum integer in the original list, mexsize is the smallest non-negative integer not in the list.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `a` is empty, `sz` is the last integer in the original list, `maxsize` remains the maximum integer in the original list, and `mexsize` is the smallest non-negative integer not in the list.
