Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, `tc` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `maxsize` is the maximum integer in `a`, `sz` is the second element in `a`, if `sz` is equal to 1, then `mexsize` is 3, otherwise `mexsize` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `mexsize` has been incremented by 1. If `sz` is equal to 1, then `mexsize` is now 3, otherwise it is 2. The values of the other variables remain the same.
