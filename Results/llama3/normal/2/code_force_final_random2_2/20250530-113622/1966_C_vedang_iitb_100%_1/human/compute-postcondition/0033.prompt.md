Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer larger than 0, tc is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a sorted list of n integers, maxsize is the maximum integer in a, mexsize is 1.
Code of the loop:
for sz in a:
    if sz == mexsize:
        mexsize = mexsize + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer larger than 0, tc is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a sorted list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, sz is the first integer in the list, maxsize is the maximum integer in a. If sz is equal to mexsize, then mexsize is updated to 2 and sz is not equal to mexsize. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer larger than 0, tc is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a sorted list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, sz is the second integer in the list, maxsize is the maximum integer in a. If sz is equal to mexsize, then mexsize is updated to 2 and sz is not equal to mexsize. Otherwise, mexsize is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer larger than 0, `tc` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least 3 integers, `sz` is the third integer in the list, `maxsize` is the maximum integer in `a`. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
