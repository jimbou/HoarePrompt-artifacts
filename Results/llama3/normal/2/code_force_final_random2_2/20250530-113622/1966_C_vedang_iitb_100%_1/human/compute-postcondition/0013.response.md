Output State: **t is an integer larger than 0, tc is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a sorted list of n integers, maxsize is the maximum integer in a, mexsize is the smallest positive integer that is not in a.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for t, tc, stdin, n, a, and maxsize as in the initial state. However, the value of mexsize will be the smallest positive integer that is not present in the list a. This is because the loop iterates over each element in a, and if the current element is equal to mexsize, it increments mexsize by 1. This process continues until the loop has iterated over all elements in a, at which point mexsize will be the smallest positive integer that is not in a.
