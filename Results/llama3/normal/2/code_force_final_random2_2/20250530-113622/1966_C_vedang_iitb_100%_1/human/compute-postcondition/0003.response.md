To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `sz` and the list `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if the list `a` has at least one element. Since `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, we can infer that `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Additionally, since `sz` is an iteration variable that takes on the values of the elements in `a`, we can infer that `sz` will take on the value of the first element in `a` during the first iteration.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, `tc` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `maxsize` is the maximum integer in `a`, `mexsize` is 1, `sz` is the first element in `a`**
