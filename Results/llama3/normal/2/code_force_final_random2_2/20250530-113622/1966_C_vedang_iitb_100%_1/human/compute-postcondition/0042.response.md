Output State: **t is an integer larger than 1, tc is 2, stdin contains t-6 test cases, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a sorted list of integers, maxsize is the maximum integer in the list, mexsize is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `tc` also remains the same as it is not affected by the code. The number of test cases in `stdin` decreases by 2 because two lines of input are consumed by the code. The value of `n` is updated to a new integer greater than 0, which is the first input consumed by the code. The list `a` is populated with a sorted list of integers from the second input consumed by the code. The value of `maxsize` is updated to the maximum integer in the list `a`. The value of `mexsize` is set to 1, regardless of its previous value. The code does not modify the values of `sz` or the printed result ('Alice' or 'Bob'), so they are not included in the output state.
