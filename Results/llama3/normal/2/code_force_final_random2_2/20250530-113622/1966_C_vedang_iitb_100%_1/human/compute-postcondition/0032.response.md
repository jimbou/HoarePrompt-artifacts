Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer larger than 0, `tc` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least 3 integers, `sz` is the third integer in the list, `maxsize` is the maximum integer in `a`. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
