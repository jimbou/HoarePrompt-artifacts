Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, `tc` is 1, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `sz` is the first integer in the list, `maxsize` is the maximum integer in `a`, `mexsize` is 2, and the current value of `sz` is not equal to `mexsize`**

In this output state, the value of `mexsize` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the current value of `sz` is no longer equal to `mexsize`, as `sz` is still the first integer in the list, but `mexsize` has been incremented.
