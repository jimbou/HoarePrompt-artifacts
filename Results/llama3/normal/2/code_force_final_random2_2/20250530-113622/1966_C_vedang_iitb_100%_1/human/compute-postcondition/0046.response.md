Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer larger than 1, `tc` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `sz` is the first element in the list `a`, `maxsize` is the maximum integer in the list. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is 2 and `sz` is not equal to `mexsize`.***
