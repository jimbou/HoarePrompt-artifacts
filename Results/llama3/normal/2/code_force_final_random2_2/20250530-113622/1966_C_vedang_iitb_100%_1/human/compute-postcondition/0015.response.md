To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's analyze the given precondition and the Python code snippet.

The precondition states that:
- `t` is an integer larger than 0.
- `tc` is 0.
- `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases.
- `n` is an integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers.
- `maxsize` is the maximum integer in `a`.
- `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer that is not in `a`.
- The current value of `mexsize` is greater than the current value of `maxsize`.

The Python code snippet contains a `print` statement with a conditional expression:
```python
print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 0 else 'Bob')
```
This statement will print either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the value of `mexsize`.

Since `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer that is not in `a`, and its value is greater than `maxsize`, we can infer that `mexsize` is an odd number. This is because if `mexsize` were even, it would be less than or equal to `maxsize`, which contradicts the precondition.

Therefore, when the `print` statement is executed, it will evaluate the conditional expression `mexsize % 2 == 0` to `False`, since `mexsize` is an odd number.

As a result, the `print` statement will output 'Bob'.

Output: **Bob**
