To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `sz` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements of the list `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `sz` is the first element in the list `a`. For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least two elements, and `sz` must be the second element in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer larger than 1, `tc` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `sz` is the second element in the list `a`, `maxsize` is the maximum integer in the list. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is 2 and `sz` is not equal to `mexsize`.**
