The only variable in the loop head is variable sz, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a. If the list a has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, a is a sorted list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, sz is the first integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list a must have at least 2 integers and sz is the second integer in the list.
State: **t is an integer larger than 0, tc is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a sorted list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, sz is the second integer in the list, maxsize is the maximum integer in a. If sz is equal to mexsize, then mexsize is updated to 2 and sz is not equal to mexsize. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
