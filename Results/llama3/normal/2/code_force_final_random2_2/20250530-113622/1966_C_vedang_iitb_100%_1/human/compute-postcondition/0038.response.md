To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state and analyze the condition within the print statement.

1. **mexsize**: It is described as the smallest non-negative integer not in the list. This means mexsize is a value that does not exist in the list but is the smallest possible non-negative integer that could fit into the list's sequence.

2. **maxsize**: This is the maximum integer in the original list. It gives us an upper bound of the values present in the list.

3. **Condition in the print statement**: The statement prints 'Alice' if mexsize is odd (mexsize % 2 == 1) and 'Bob' if mexsize is even.

Given that mexsize is less than or equal to maxsize and is the smallest non-negative integer not in the list, we can infer the following:

- If the list contains all non-negative integers up to maxsize without any gaps, then mexsize would be maxsize + 1. However, since mexsize is less than or equal to maxsize, this scenario cannot occur under the given conditions.

- Since mexsize is the smallest non-negative integer not in the list and is less than or equal to maxsize, it implies that the list does not contain all integers from 0 up to maxsize. There is at least one integer missing in this range, and mexsize is the smallest of these missing integers.

- The parity (odd or even) of mexsize is determined by its value. If mexsize is an odd number, the statement prints 'Alice'. If mexsize is an even number, the statement prints 'Bob'.

Without knowing the exact values in the list or the value of mexsize, we cannot determine whether mexsize is odd or even. However, we can describe the output based on the condition provided:

Output: **'Alice' if mexsize is odd, 'Bob' if mexsize is even**
