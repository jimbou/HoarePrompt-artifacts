Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer larger than 0, `tc` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `maxsize` is the maximum integer in `a`, `sz` is the second element in `a`. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is updated to 3 if `sz` is 1, otherwise `mexsize` is updated to 2. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
