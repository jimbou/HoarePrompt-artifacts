Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 1, `tc` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `maxsize` is the maximum integer in the list, `sz` is the last element in the list `a`, `mexsize` is either equal to `maxsize` + 1 or not equal to any element in the list `a`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t`, `tc`, `stdin`, `n`, and `maxsize` remain unchanged. The list `a` is still sorted, but the variable `sz` now points to the last element in the list. The variable `mexsize` has been incremented until it is either one more than the maximum value in the list (`maxsize` + 1) or it is not equal to any element in the list `a`.
