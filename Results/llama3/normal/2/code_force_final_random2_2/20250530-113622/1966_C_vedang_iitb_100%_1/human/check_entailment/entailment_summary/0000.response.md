Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for determining the winner of the game based on the smallest positive integer missing from the sorted list of pile sizes. The program first finds the maximum pile size and then finds the smallest positive integer missing from the sorted list (mexsize). If mexsize is greater than the maximum pile size, the program prints 'Alice' if mexsize is even and 'Bob' if mexsize is odd. Otherwise, it prints 'Alice' if mexsize is odd and 'Bob' if mexsize is even. This logic is consistent with the problem description and the example outputs.

Correctness: **True**
