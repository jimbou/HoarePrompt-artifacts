The only variable in the loop head is variable  sz and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, a is a sorted list of n integers, sz is the second element in a. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the sz is the third element in the list.
State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, `tc` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `maxsize` is the maximum integer in `a`, `sz` is the third element in `a`. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is updated to 3 if `sz` is 1, otherwise `mexsize` is updated to 2. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
