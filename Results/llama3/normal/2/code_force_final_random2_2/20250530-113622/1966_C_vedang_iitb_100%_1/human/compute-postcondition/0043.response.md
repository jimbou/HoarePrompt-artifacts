To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `sz` and the list `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `a` is a sorted list of integers, we can assume that the first element in the list is the smallest integer.

To make the loop execute, we need to adjust the state of `sz` to be the first element in the list `a`, and ensure that the list `a` has at least 1 element.

State: **`t` is an integer larger than 1, `tc` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `sz` is the first element in the list `a`, `maxsize` is the maximum integer in the list, `mexsize` is 1**
