Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, `tc` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `maxsize` is the maximum integer in `a`, `sz` is the third element in `a`. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is either 4 if `sz` is 1, otherwise `mexsize` is 3. Otherwise, `mexsize` is updated to `mexsize + 1`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `mexsize` is incremented by 1. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is updated to 3 if `sz` is 1, otherwise `mexsize` is updated to 2. Otherwise, `mexsize` is updated to `mexsize + 1`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
