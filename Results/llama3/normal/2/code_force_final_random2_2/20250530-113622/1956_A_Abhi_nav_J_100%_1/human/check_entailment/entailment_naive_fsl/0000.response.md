Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the game logic. The function `func_1` only considers the first element of the sequence `a` and the value of `n_i`, but it does not take into account the rest of the sequence `a`. 

For example, if `a = [3, 5]` and `n_i = 5`, the function `func_1` will return `2`, but the correct answer is `2` because players `C` and `E` are kicked out in the first round, and player `D` is kicked out in the second round, leaving players `A` and `B` as winners.

To correctly implement the game logic, the program should simulate the game for each value of `n_i` and each sequence `a`, kicking out players according to the sequence `a` until no more players are kicked out. The number of remaining players is the correct answer.
