#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of distinct integers and b is a list of integers.
    if (a <= b) :
        return a - 1
        #The program returns a list of integers that is one less than the list 'a' which contains distinct integers and is less than or equal to list 'b'.
    else :
        return b
        #The program returns list 'b' which contains integers and is less than list 'a'

#Overall this is what the function does:This function compares two lists of integers, 'a' and 'b', and returns either a list one less than 'a' if 'a' is less than or equal to 'b', or list 'b' if 'a' is greater than 'b'.
