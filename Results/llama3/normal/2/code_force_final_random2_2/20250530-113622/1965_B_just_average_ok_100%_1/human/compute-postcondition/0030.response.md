Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2, stdin is empty, idx is an integer between -1 and 20 inclusive.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the value of `idx` will be the index of the last element in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`. If all elements in `nums` are greater than `k`, then `idx` will be -1. The values of `n`, `k`, `nums`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
