Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 22 integers where each integer is a power of 2 and must have at least 3 integers, int(input()) is a positive integer, i is the index of the next element in nums, idx is i - 1**

The code assigns the value of `i - 1` to `idx`, which means `idx` is now one less than the index of the next element in `nums`. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. No other variables are affected by the code.
