Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `nums` is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2 that must have at least 2 elements, `stdin` is empty, if `nums[1]` is greater than `k`, then `idx` is 0, otherwise no changes are made to `idx` and `i` remains 1.***
