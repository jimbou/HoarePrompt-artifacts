Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2 except for the last three elements which are k - nums[idx], k + 1, and k + nums[idx] + 1 respectively, stdin is empty, idx is an integer between -1 and 20 inclusive.**

The code modifies the list `nums` by appending three new elements: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`. The `remove` method is used to remove the element `1 << idx` from the list. The values of `n`, `k`, and `idx` remain unchanged. The `stdin` remains empty as it was initially.
