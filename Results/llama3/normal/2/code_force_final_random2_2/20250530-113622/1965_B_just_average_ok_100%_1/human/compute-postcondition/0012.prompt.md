Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2, idx is -1, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, int(input()) is a positive integer
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(nums)):
    if nums[i] > k:
        idx = i - 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2 and must have at least 1 integer, i is 0, idx is -1, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, int(input()) is a positive integer. If the current value of nums[i] is greater than k, then the current value of nums[i] is greater than k.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2 and must have at least 2 integers, int(input()) is a positive integer. If the current value of nums[i] is greater than k, then idx is set to 0. Otherwise, no change is made to idx.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 22 integers where each integer is a power of 2 and must have at least 3 integers, int(input()) is a positive integer. If nums[i] is larger than k, then the index of the next element in nums is i - 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
