Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2 and must have at least 2 integers, i is 1, idx is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, int(input()) is a positive integer.**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `i - 1` to `idx`. Since `i` is 1, `idx` becomes 0. The second line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables.

The initial state of the variables remains the same, except for `idx`, which is updated to 0. The value of `i` is still 1, and the list `nums` remains unchanged. The state of `stdin` and `int(input())` also remains the same.
