To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(nums)):`. This means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `nums`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

The state of `nums` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the loop head.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `stdin`, and `idx`) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `nums` is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2, `idx` is either 0, -1, or -2 (depending on the previous iteration's condition)**
