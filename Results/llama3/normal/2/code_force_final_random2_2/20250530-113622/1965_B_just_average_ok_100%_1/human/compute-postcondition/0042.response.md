The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `nums`. If `i` is less than `len(nums)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list of 21 integers. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and `nums` must still be a list of 21 integers.
State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2, idx is -1 if nums[i] is less than or equal to k, otherwise idx is -2, stdin is empty, i is 1**
