Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2 and must have at least 2 integers, int(input()) is a positive integer. If the current value of nums[i] is greater than k, then idx is set to 0. Otherwise, no change is made to idx.***
