This function reads input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n) from stdin. It then generates a list of 21 integers, where each integer is a power of 2, except for three integers which are k - nums[idx], k + 1, and k + nums[idx] + 1. The function prints the length of the list (21) and the list of 21 integers. The function repeats this process for each test case.
