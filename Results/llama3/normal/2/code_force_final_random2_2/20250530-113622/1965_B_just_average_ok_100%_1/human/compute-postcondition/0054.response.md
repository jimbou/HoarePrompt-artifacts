Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2 except for three integers which are k - nums[idx], k + 1, and k + nums[idx] + 1, i is between 0 and 20 inclusive, idx is between -1 and 20 inclusive, stdin is empty, the length of the list nums which is 21 is being printed, and the list of 21 integers in nums is being printed**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the variables within the loop have reached their final values. The input from stdin has been fully processed, and the output has been printed. The list 'nums' contains 21 integers, with the last three elements being the result of the operations performed within the loop. The index 'idx' and the variable 'i' have reached their final values, and the input stream 'stdin' is empty, indicating that all input has been processed.
