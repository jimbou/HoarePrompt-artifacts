Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2, stdin is empty, i is 2, idx is 1**

In this output state, the value of `idx` has been updated to 1, which is the result of subtracting 1 from the value of `i` (2). All other variables remain unchanged, as the code snippet does not modify them. The `break` statement does not affect the state of the variables.
