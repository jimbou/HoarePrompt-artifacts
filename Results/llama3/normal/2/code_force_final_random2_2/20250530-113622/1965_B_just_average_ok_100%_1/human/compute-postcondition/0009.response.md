To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `nums`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `nums`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is at the index of the last element in `nums` that was processed, and `nums` has at least 2 integers.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `nums` must have at least one more element.

State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 22 integers where each integer is a power of 2 and must have at least 3 integers, int(input()) is a positive integer, i is the index of the next element in nums**
