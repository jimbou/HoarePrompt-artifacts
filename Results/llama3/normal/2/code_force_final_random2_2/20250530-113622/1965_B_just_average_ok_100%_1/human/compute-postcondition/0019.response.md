Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2, idx is -1, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input provided, which is a positive integer. The list `nums` is created with 21 integers, each being a power of 2, ranging from 2^0 to 2^20. The variable `idx` is initialized to -1, indicating that it has not been updated to point to any element in the list `nums`. The stdin is empty, indicating that the input has been read and processed.
