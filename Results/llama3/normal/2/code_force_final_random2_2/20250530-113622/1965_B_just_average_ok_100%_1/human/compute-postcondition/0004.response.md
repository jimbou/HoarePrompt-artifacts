Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2 and must have at least 1 integer, i is 0, idx is -1, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, int(input()) is a positive integer. The current value of nums[i] is greater than k.**

The code block consists of two lines: `idx = i - 1` and `break`. The first line assigns the value of `i - 1` to `idx`. Since `i` is 0, `idx` becomes -1. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop or switch statement in the provided code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect.

The initial state of the variables and stdin remains unchanged, except for the value of `idx`, which is now -1. The value of `nums[i]` is still greater than `k`, as the code does not modify `nums` or `k`.
