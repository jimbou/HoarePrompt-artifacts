To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `nums`. The loop will execute if `nums` has at least one element. Since `nums` is already defined as a list of 21 integers, we can confirm that it has at least one element. Therefore, we only need to adjust the state of `i` to 0, which is the starting index of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `nums` is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2, `idx` is -1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0**
