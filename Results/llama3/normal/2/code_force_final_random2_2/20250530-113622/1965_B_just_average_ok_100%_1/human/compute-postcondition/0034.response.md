The code prints the elements of the list `nums`. The list `nums` contains 21 integers, where the first 18 integers are powers of 2, and the last three integers are `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` respectively.

Since `idx` is an integer between -1 and 20 inclusive, `nums[idx]` will be a power of 2 if `idx` is between 0 and 17 inclusive, or it will be one of the last three elements if `idx` is between 18 and 20 inclusive.

The value of `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive.

Therefore, the output will be a list of 21 integers, where the first 18 integers are powers of 2, and the last three integers are expressions involving `k` and a power of 2.

Output: **[list of 21 integers, where the first 18 integers are powers of 2, and the last three integers are k - nums[idx], k + 1, and k + nums[idx] + 1 respectively]**
