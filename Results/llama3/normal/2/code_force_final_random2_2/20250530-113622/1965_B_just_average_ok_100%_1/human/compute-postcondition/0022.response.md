Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2 that must have at least 1 element, idx is -2, stdin is empty, i is 0, and the current value of nums[i] is greater than k**

Explanation: The first line assigns the value of `i - 1` to `idx`. Since `i` is 0, `idx` becomes -1. The second line is a break statement, which does not affect any variables. No other variables are affected.
