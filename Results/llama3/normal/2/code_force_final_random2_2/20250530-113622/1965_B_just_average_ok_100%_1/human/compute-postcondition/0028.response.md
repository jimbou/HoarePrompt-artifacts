Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2 that must have at least 2 elements, stdin is empty, idx is 1, i is 2**

The code snippet assigns the value of `i - 1` to `idx`, which is 2 - 1 = 1. The break statement does not affect any variables. The initial state of `n`, `k`, `nums`, and `stdin` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
