Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2 that must have at least 2 elements, stdin is empty, idx is 0, i is 1**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `i - 1` to `idx`. Since `i` is 1, `idx` becomes 0. The second line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables. 

Therefore, the final state includes all the variables from the initial state, with `idx` updated to 0. The values of `n`, `k`, `nums`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged.
