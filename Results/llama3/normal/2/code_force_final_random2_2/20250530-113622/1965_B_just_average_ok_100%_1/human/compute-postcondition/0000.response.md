The only objects in the loop head are variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the expression `int(input())`. If the expression evaluates to a positive integer, the loop can execute. Since the problem statement specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, we can adjust the state to reflect this.

State: **`stdin` contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n), `_` is 0, `int(input())` is a positive integer**
