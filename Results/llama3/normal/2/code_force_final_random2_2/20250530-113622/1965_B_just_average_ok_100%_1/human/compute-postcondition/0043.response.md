The first line assigns the value of `i - 1` to `idx`. Since `i` is 1, `idx` becomes 0. The second line is a break statement, which does not affect any variables.

Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2, idx is 0, stdin is empty, i is 1**
