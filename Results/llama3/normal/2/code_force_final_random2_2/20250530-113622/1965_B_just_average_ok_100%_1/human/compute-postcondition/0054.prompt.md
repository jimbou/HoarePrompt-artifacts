Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(21)]
    idx = -1
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] > k:
            idx = i - 1
            break
    nums.append(k - nums[idx])
    nums.append(k + 1)
    nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
    nums.remove(1 << idx)
    print(len(nums))
    print(*nums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 23 integers where each integer is a power of 2 except for the last three elements, idx is the index of the last element in nums that is less than or equal to k, stdin contains a positive integer, the length of the list nums which is 23 is being printed, and the list nums is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2 except for the last three elements which are k - nums[idx], k + 1, and k + nums[idx] + 1 respectively, stdin is empty, idx is an integer between -1 and 20 inclusive, the length of the list nums which is 21 is being printed, and the list of integers nums is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2 except for three integers which are k - nums[idx], k + 1, and k + nums[idx] + 1, i is between 0 and 20 inclusive, idx is between -1 and 20 inclusive, stdin is empty, the length of the list nums which is 21 is being printed, and the list of 21 integers in nums is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
