Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2, idx is -1, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, int(input()) is a positive integer**

In this output state, the value of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input from `stdin`, which contains `t` lines of input. The list `nums` is created with 21 integers, each being a power of 2, ranging from 2^0 to 2^20. The variable `idx` is initialized to -1. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. The state of `stdin` is updated to reflect that one line of input has been consumed, leaving `t-1` lines remaining. The state of `int(input())` remains unchanged as a positive integer.
