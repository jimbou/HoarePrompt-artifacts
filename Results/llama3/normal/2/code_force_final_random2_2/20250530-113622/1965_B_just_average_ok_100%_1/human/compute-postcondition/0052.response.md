The code prints the elements of the list `nums`. The list `nums` contains 21 integers, where each integer is a power of 2 except for three integers which are `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`. Since the exact values of `k`, `idx`, and the powers of 2 in the list are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of these three integers. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the 21 integers in the list `nums`, including the three integers that are not powers of 2.

Output: **21 integers, where 18 are powers of 2, one is k - nums[idx], one is k + 1, and one is k + nums[idx] + 1 (where k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, and idx is between -1 and 20 inclusive)**
