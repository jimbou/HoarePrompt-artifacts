Postcondition: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2 that must have at least 1 element, stdin is empty. If the current value of nums[i] is greater than k, then idx is -2 and i is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to idx and i.**
