Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding a sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25, such that there is no subsequence with a sum of k, and for all 1 ≤ v ≤ n where v ≠ k, there is a subsequence with a sum of v.

The program starts by reading the number of test cases t from the input. Then, for each test case, it reads two integers n and k.

The program initializes a list nums with 21 integers, each of which is a power of 2. It then finds the index idx such that the power of 2 at that index is less than or equal to k.

The program then appends three integers to the list nums: k - nums[idx], k + 1, and k + nums[idx] + 1. It also removes the power of 2 at index idx from the list.

Finally, the program prints the length of the list nums and the list itself.

The program's logic is correct because it ensures that there is no subsequence with a sum of k by removing the power of 2 that would be needed to sum up to k. It also ensures that for all 1 ≤ v ≤ n where v ≠ k, there is a subsequence with a sum of v by including all powers of 2 up to the one that is less than or equal to k, as well as the three additional integers that are appended to the list.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
