Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2 except for three integers which are k - nums[idx], k + 1, and k + nums[idx] + 1, i is between 0 and 20 inclusive, idx is between -1 and 20 inclusive, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `n` and `k` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The list `nums` initially contained 21 integers, each being a power of 2. After the code execution, three new integers are appended to the list: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`. Also, the integer `1 << idx` is removed from the list. The values of `i` and `idx` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The stdin remains empty as it was initially empty and no input operations were performed.
