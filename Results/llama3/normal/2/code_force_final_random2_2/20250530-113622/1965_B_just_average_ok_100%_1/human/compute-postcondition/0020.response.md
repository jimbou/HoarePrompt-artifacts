The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nums.  If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, idx is -1, stdin is empty. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the i is 0.
State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2 that must have at least 1 element, idx is -1, stdin is empty, i is 0**
