Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 22 integers where each integer is a power of 2 and must have at least 3 integers, int(input()) is a positive integer. If nums[i] is larger than k, then the index of the next element in nums is i - 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
