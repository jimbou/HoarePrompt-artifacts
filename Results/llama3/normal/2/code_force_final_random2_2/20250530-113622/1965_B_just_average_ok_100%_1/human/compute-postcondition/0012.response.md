Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2 and must have at least 21 integers, int(input()) is a positive integer. If the current value of nums[i] is greater than k, then idx is set to the index of the last element in nums that is less than or equal to k. Otherwise, idx remains -1.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations, the output state will have the same constraints on the variables n, k, and int(input()) as before. The list nums will have at least 21 integers, all of which are powers of 2. The variable idx will be set to the index of the last element in nums that is less than or equal to k if such an element exists; otherwise, it will remain -1.
