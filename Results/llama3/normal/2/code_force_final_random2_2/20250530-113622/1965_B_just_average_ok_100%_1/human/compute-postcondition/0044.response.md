Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2, stdin is empty, i is 1. If nums[i] is greater than k, then idx is 0. Otherwise, idx remains -1 if nums[i] is less than or equal to k, otherwise idx is -2.***
