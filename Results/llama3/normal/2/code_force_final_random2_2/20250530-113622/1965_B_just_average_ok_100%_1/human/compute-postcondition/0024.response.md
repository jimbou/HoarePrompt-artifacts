The only variables in the loop head are variable `i` and list `nums`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and list `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `nums` has at least 1 element. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `nums` must have at least 2 elements.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `nums` is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2 that must have at least 2 elements, `stdin` is empty, `idx` is -2, `i` is 1**
