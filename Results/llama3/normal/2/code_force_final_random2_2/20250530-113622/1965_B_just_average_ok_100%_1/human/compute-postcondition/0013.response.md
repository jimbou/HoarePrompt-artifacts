Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 23 integers where each integer is a power of 2 except for the last three elements, idx is the index of the last element in nums that is less than or equal to k, stdin contains a positive integer.**

In this final state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `k` also remains unchanged. The list `nums` initially had 21 integers, all of which were powers of 2. After the code execution, three new elements are appended to `nums`: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`. These elements are not necessarily powers of 2, so `nums` now contains 23 integers where each integer is a power of 2 except for the last three elements. The value of `idx` remains the index of the last element in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`. The stdin still contains a positive integer as it was not modified by the code.
