Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `nums` is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2, `stdin` is empty. If `nums[2]` is greater than `k`, then `i` is 2 and `idx` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `i` and `idx`.***
