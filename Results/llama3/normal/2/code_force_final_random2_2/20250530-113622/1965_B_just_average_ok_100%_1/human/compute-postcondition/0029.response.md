Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2 that must have at least 2 elements, stdin is empty. If nums[2] is greater than k, then idx is 1 and i is 2. Otherwise, the state of idx and i is not changed.***
