Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2, stdin is empty, i is between 0 and 20 inclusive, idx is between -1 and 20 inclusive.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `i` will be between 0 and 20 inclusive, and the variable `idx` will be between -1 and 20 inclusive. The values of `n`, `k`, `nums`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
