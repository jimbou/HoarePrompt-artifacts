To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(nums)):`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `nums` is a list of 21 integers. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `nums` must still have at least 2 elements (since `i` will be 2, and we need at least 2 elements in the list for the loop to execute again).

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `stdin`, `idx`) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not affect the loop's execution.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `nums` is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2 that must have at least 2 elements, `stdin` is empty, `idx` is 0 (if `nums[1]` is greater than `k`), `i` is 2**
