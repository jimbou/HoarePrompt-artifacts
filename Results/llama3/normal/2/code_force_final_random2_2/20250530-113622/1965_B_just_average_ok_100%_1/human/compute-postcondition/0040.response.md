Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2, idx is -2, stdin is empty, i is 0. The current value of nums[i] is higher than k**

In this output state, the value of idx has been updated to -2, which is the result of subtracting 1 from the initial value of i (0). All other variables remain unchanged, as the code snippet does not modify them. The precondition information about n, k, nums, stdin, and i is still valid, and the relationship between nums[i] and k is preserved.
