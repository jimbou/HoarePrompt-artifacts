The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 100. For the loop to execute again `_` must be 2 and `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 100, cases is a list of t+1 tuples, each tuple contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) and a string s of length n consisting of only "U" and "D" characters, _ is 2, stdin is empty**
