Output State: **`case` is a list of two elements, the first element is an integer and the second element is a string consisting of 'U's and 'D's, `ups` is the number of 'U's in the second element of `case`.**

In this output state, the value of `ups` is calculated by counting the number of 'U's in the second element of the `case` list. The value of `case` remains unchanged, and the first element is still an integer, while the second element is still a string consisting of 'U's and 'D's.
