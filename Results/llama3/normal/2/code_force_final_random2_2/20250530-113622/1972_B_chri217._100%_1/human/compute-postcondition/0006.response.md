Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 100, cases is a list of t+2 tuples, each tuple contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) and a string s of length n consisting of only "U" and "D" characters, _ is 2, stdin is empty**

The code reads an integer n and a string s from stdin, and appends a tuple (n, s) to the list cases. Since stdin is initially empty, it remains empty after the execution of the code. The value of _ is not affected by the code and remains 2. The length of the list cases increases by 1, and the new tuple contains the integer n and the string s, which are read from stdin. The integer n is between 1 and 100, and the string s has a length of n and consists only of "U" and "D" characters.
