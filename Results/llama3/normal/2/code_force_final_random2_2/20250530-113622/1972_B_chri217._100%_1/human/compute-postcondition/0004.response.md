Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 100, cases is a list of t+1 tuples, each tuple contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) and a string s of length n consisting of only "U" and "D" characters, _ is 1, stdin is empty**

The code reads an integer n and a string s from stdin, and appends a tuple (n, s) to the list cases. Since stdin is empty initially, the read operations will not affect the state of stdin. The value of t remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list cases is updated by appending a new tuple, increasing its length by 1. The value of _ is not affected by the code and remains 1.
