Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100, cases is a list of t tuples, each tuple contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) and a string s of length n consisting of only "U" and "D" characters, _ is t-1, stdin is empty**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable 't' will still be an integer between 1 and 100, the list 'cases' will contain 't' number of tuples, each tuple containing an integer 'n' and a string 's' as described. The variable '_' will be one less than 't', and the standard input 'stdin' will be empty, indicating that all input has been read.
