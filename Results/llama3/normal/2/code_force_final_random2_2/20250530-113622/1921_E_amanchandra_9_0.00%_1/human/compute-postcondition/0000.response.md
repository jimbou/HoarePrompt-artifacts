The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `input()`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `input()` which is `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `stdin` contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
