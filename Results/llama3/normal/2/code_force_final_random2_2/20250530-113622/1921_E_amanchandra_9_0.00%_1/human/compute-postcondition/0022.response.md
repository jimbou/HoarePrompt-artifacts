Output State: **t is greater than 1, i is 1, h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb are integers, x is the integer half of the absolute difference between xa and xb, l is the maximum of 1 and yb - x, r is the minimum of w and yb + x, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

The code snippet calculates the values of `l` and `r` based on the previously assigned values of `x`, `w`, and `yb`. The value of `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`, while the value of `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
