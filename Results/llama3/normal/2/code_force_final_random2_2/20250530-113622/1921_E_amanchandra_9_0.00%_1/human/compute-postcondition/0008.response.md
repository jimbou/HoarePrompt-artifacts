Output State: **t is greater than 0, i is 0, h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb are integers, x is the integer part of half of the absolute difference between xa and xb, l is the maximum of 1 and yb - x, r is the minimum of w and yb + x, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, xa is less than or equal to xb, and the absolute difference between xa and xb is odd**

The code assigns the maximum value between 1 and `yb - x` to `l`, and the minimum value between `w` and `yb + x` to `r`. The values of `t`, `i`, `h`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, and `x` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, containing multiple test cases minus one. The relationship between `xa` and `xb` remains the same, with `xa` being less than or equal to `xb`, and the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` being odd.
