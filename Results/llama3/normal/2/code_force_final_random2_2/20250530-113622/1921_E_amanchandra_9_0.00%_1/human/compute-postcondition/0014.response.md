Output: **t is greater than 0, i is 0, h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb are integers, x is the integer part of half of the absolute difference between xa and xb, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, xa is less than or equal to xb, the absolute difference between xa and xb is even, l is the maximum of 1 and ya - x, r is the minimum of w and yb + x, and this is printed: 'Draw' if the absolute difference between l and yb is less than or equal to x and the absolute difference between r and yb is less than or equal to x, otherwise 'Bob'**
