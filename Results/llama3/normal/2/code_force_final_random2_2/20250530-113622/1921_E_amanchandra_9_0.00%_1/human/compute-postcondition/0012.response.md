Output State: **t is greater than 0, i is 0, h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb are integers, x is the integer part of half of the absolute difference between xa and xb, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, xa is less than or equal to xb, the absolute difference between xa and xb is even, l is the maximum of 1 and ya - x, r is the minimum of w and yb + x**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `l` is now the maximum of 1 and `ya - x`, and the value of `r` is now the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases - 1, and the conditions `xa` is less than or equal to `xb` and the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even remain valid.
