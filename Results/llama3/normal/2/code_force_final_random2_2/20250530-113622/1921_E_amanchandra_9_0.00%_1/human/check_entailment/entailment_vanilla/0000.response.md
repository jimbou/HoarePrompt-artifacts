Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the outcome of a game played on a checkered board by Alice and Bob. The game's rules and constraints are well-defined in the problem description.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1.  The program iterates over each test case using a for loop.
2.  For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the board (`h` and `w`) and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (`xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`).
3.  The program first checks if `xa` is greater than `xb`. If true, it immediately prints "Draw" because Alice cannot win in this scenario. This is correct according to the game's rules.
4.  If `xa` is not greater than `xb`, the program calculates the number of rows (`x`) that Alice needs to move to reach Bob's row. It uses the formula `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`.
5.  The program then checks if the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd. If true, it means that Alice will move an odd number of times to reach Bob's row.
    *   In this case, the program calculates the left and right boundaries (`l` and `r`) of the possible columns that Alice can reach. It uses the formula `l = max(1, yb - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`.
    *   The program then checks if Alice can reach Bob's column within `x + 1` moves. If true, it prints "Alice"; otherwise, it prints "Draw". This logic is correct according to the game's rules.
6.  If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even, the program calculates the left and right boundaries (`l` and `r`) of the possible columns that Bob can reach. It uses the formula `l = max(1, ya - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`.
    *   The program then checks if Bob can reach Alice's column within `x` moves. If true, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Draw". This logic is correct according to the game's rules.

Based on the step-by-step analysis, the program correctly implements the game's rules and logic to determine the outcome of the game.

Correctness: **True**
