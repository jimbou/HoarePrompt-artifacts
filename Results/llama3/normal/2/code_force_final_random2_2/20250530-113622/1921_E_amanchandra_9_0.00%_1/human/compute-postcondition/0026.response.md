The code prints either 'Draw' or 'Bob' based on the conditions `abs(l - yb) <= x` and `abs(r - yb) <= x`. 

Here, `l` is the maximum value between 1 and `ya` minus `x`, `r` is the minimum value between `w` and `yb` plus `x`, and `x` is the integer half of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`. 

Since the exact values of `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, `yb`, `w`, and `h` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `l`, `r`, and `x`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either 'Draw' or 'Bob' depending on the conditions.

Output: **'Draw' if abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x, otherwise 'Bob'**
