The code prints either 'Draw' or 'Alice' based on the conditions `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`. Where l is the maximum of 1 and yb - x, r is the minimum of w and yb + x, x is the integer half of the absolute difference between xa and xb, and ya is an integer.

Output: **t is greater than 1, i is 1, h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb are integers, x is the integer half of the absolute difference between xa and xb, l is the maximum of 1 and yb - x, r is the minimum of w and yb + x, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, and either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed based on the conditions `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`**
