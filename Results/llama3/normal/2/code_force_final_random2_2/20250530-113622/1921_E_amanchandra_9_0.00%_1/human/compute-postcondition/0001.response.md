Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**.

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are assigned integer values from the input. The stdin now contains one less test case than before, as one test case has been read and processed.
