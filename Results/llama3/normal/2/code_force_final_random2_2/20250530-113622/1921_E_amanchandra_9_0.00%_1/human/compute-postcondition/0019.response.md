Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the string 'Draw'.

Here's the explanation:

* The precondition states that `t` is greater than 1, but this information is not relevant to the print statement.
* The precondition also states that `i` is 1, but this information is not relevant to the print statement either.
* The precondition mentions that `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers that have been assigned values from the input, but these variables are not used in the print statement.
* The precondition mentions that stdin contains multiple test cases - 2, but this information is not relevant to the print statement.

Since the print statement simply prints the string 'Draw', the output will be exactly that.

Output: **Draw**
