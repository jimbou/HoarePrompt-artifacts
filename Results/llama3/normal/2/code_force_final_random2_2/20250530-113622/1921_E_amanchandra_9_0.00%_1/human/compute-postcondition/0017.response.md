The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, `yb` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**
