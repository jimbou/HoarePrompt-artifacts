Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers that have been assigned values from the input, `x` is the integer part of half the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` remain unchanged as they were assigned values from the input and were not modified by the code. The variable `x` is newly introduced and is assigned the integer part of half the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one less than before, as indicated by "- 1".
