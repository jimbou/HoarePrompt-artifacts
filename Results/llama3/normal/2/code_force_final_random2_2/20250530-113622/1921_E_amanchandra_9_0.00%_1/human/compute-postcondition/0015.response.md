Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, i is 0, h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb are integers, x is the integer part of half of the absolute difference between xa and xb, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, xa is less than or equal to xb. If the absolute difference between xa and xb is odd, either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed based on the conditions `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`. If the absolute difference between xa and xb is even, 'Draw' is printed if the absolute difference between l and yb is less than or equal to x and the absolute difference between r and yb is less than or equal to x, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.***
