Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b such that 1 <= x_a, x_b <= h <= 10^6 and 1 <= y_a, y_b <= w <= 10^9. The first integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) represents the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb = map(int, input().split())
    if xa > xb:
        print('Draw')
    else:
        x = abs(xa - xb) // 2
        if abs(xa - xb) % 2:
            l = max(1, yb - x)
            r = min(w, yb + x)
            print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r -
                ya) <= x + 1])
        else:
            l = max(1, ya - x)
            r = min(w, yb + x)
            print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, `yb` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `xa` is greater than `xb`, 'Draw' is printed. If `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`, then if the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed based on the conditions `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even, 'Draw' is printed if the absolute difference between `l` and `yb` is less than or equal to `x` and the absolute difference between `r` and `yb` is less than or equal to `x`, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers that have been assigned values from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `xa` > `xb`, 'Draw' is printed. If `xa` <= `xb`, `x` is the integer half of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed based on the conditions `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`, where `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`, and `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even, either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed based on the conditions `abs(l - yb) <= x` and `abs(r - yb) <= x`, where `l` is the maximum value between 1 and `ya - x`, and `r` is the minimum value between `w` and `yb + x

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is greater than 2, i is 2, h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb are integers that have been assigned values from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If xa is greater than xb, 'Draw' is printed. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between xa and xb is odd, either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed based on the conditions abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1 where l is the maximum of 1 and yb - x, r is the minimum of w and yb + x. If the absolute difference between xa and xb is even, either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between l and yb is less than or equal to x and the absolute difference between r and yb is less than or equal to x where l is the maximum of 1 and ya - x, r is the minimum of w and yb + x.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
