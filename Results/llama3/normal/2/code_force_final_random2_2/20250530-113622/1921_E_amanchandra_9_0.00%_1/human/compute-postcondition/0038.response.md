Output State: **t is greater than 2, i is 2, h, w, xa, xb, ya, yb are integers, x is the integer part of half the absolute difference between xa and xb, l is the maximum of 1 and ya - x, r is the minimum of w and yb + x, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, and `yb` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The value of `x` also remains the same as it was already calculated before the code execution. The code introduces two new variables, `l` and `r`, which are calculated based on the existing variables. The value of `l` is the maximum of 1 and `ya - x`, and the value of `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1.
