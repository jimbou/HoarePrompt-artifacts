Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers that have been assigned values from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**


In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are assigned new values from the input, which is a space-separated list of integers. The stdin now contains one less test case as one test case has been consumed by the input operation.
