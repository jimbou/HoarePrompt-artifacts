Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the string 'Draw'.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

* The precondition states that `t` is greater than 2, but this information is not relevant to the print statement.
* The precondition also states that `i` is 2, but this information is also not relevant to the print statement.
* The precondition mentions that `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers that have been assigned values from the input, but these values are not used in the print statement.
* The precondition mentions that stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, but this information is not relevant to the print statement.
* The print statement simply prints the string 'Draw'.

Therefore, the output will be the string 'Draw', without any variables or values being printed.

Output: **Draw**
