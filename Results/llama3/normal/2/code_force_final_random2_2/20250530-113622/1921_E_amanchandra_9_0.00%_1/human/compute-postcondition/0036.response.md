The code prints either 'Draw' or 'Alice' based on the conditions `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`. 

Here, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`, `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`, `x` is the integer part of half the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`, and `ya` is an integer.

If both conditions are true, it prints 'Alice', otherwise it prints 'Draw'.

Output: **'Alice' if both conditions are true, otherwise 'Draw'**
