Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers that have been assigned values from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `xa` > `xb`, 'Draw' is printed. If `xa` <= `xb`, `x` is the integer half of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed based on the conditions `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`, where `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`, and `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even, either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed based on the conditions `abs(l - yb) <= x` and `abs(r - yb) <= x`, where `l` is the maximum value between 1 and `ya - x`, and `r` is the minimum value between `w` and `yb + x***
