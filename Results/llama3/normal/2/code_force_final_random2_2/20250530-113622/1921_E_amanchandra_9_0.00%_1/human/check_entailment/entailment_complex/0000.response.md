Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the positions of Alice's and Bob's chips and the dimensions of the board.

The program first checks if Alice's chip is above Bob's chip. If it is, the game is a draw because Alice cannot move her chip to a position that would allow her to win.

If Alice's chip is not above Bob's chip, the program calculates the number of rows that Alice needs to move her chip to reach Bob's row. It then checks if Alice can move her chip to a position that would allow her to win by checking if the distance between Alice's chip and the left and right boundaries of the board is within the number of rows she needs to move.

If Alice can move her chip to a winning position, the program prints "Alice". Otherwise, it prints "Draw".

The program also correctly handles the case where Bob's chip is above Alice's chip by swapping the roles of Alice and Bob in the logic.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the positions of the chips and the dimensions of the board.

Correctness: **True**
