Output: **t is greater than 2, i is 2, h, w, xa, yb are integers, xb is an integer, ya is an integer, x is the integer part of half the absolute difference between xa and xb, l is the maximum of 1 and yb - x, r is the minimum of w and yb + x, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, and either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed based on the conditions abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1**
