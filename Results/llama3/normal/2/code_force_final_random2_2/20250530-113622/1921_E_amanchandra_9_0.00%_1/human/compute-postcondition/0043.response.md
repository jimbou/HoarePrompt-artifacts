Output State: **All test cases have been processed, and the output for each test case has been printed. The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` have been assigned values from the input for each test case. The output for each test case is either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob', depending on the conditions specified in the loop body.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has finished executing for all test cases, and the output for each test case has been printed. The loop has iterated `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided in the input. For each test case, the variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` have been assigned values from the input, and the output for each test case has been determined based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The output for each test case is either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob', depending on the specific conditions met during the execution of the loop.
