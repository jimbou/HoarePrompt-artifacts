Output: **t is greater than 1, i is 1, h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb are integers that have been assigned values from the input, x is the integer half of the absolute difference between xa and xb, l is the maximum value between 1 and ya minus x, r is the minimum value between w and yb plus x, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, and this is printed: either 'Draw' or 'Bob' depending on whether the absolute difference between l and yb is less than or equal to x and the absolute difference between r and yb is less than or equal to x**
