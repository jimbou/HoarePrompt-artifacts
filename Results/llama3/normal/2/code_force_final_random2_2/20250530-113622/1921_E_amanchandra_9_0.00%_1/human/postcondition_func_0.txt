This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains six integers representing the dimensions of a rectangle and the positions of two points. It determines the winner of a game based on the positions of the points and the dimensions of the rectangle, printing 'Draw' if there is no winner, 'Alice' if Alice wins, or 'Bob' if Bob wins. The function iterates over all test cases, processing each one independently and printing the result for each case.
