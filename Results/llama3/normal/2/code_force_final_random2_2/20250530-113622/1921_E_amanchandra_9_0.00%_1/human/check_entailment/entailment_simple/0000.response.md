Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to determine the outcome of a game played on a checkered board by two players, Alice and Bob. The game's rules and constraints are clearly defined in the problem description.

The program's logic is based on the fact that if Alice's chip is above Bob's chip, the game will end in a draw because Alice can always move her chip down, and Bob can always move his chip up. If Alice's chip is below Bob's chip, the program calculates the number of moves required for Alice to reach Bob's row and checks if Alice can capture Bob's chip within that number of moves.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible scenarios. The use of the `//` operator for integer division and the `abs` function for calculating absolute differences ensures that the program produces accurate results.

The program's output is also correct, as it prints "Draw" when the game ends in a draw, "Alice" when Alice wins, and "Bob" when Bob wins.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, I conclude that the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
