Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, `yb` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `xa` is greater than `xb`, 'Draw' is printed. If `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`, then if the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed based on the conditions `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even, 'Draw' is printed if the absolute difference between `l` and `yb` is less than or equal to `x` and the absolute difference between `r` and `yb` is less than or equal to `x`, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.***
