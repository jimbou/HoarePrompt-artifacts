Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers that have been assigned values from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2**

In this output state, the values of `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` have been updated to the integers read from the input, which was a space-separated list of integers. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in the stdin has decreased by 1.
