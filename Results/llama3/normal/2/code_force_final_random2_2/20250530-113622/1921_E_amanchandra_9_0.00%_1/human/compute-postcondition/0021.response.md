Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers that have been assigned values from the input, `x` is the integer half of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` remain unchanged as they were assigned values from the input. The new variable `x` is introduced, which is calculated as the integer half of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1.
