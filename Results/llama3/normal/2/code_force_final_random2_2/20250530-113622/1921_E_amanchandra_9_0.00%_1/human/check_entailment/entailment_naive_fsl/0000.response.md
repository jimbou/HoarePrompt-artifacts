Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the outcome of the game in all cases. 

One case where the program fails is when Alice's chip is in the last row and Bob's chip is in the first row, but Alice can still make a move to capture Bob's chip. In this case, the program incorrectly outputs "Draw" instead of "Alice".

For example, consider the input:

10 10 10 6 1 6

In this case, Alice's chip is in the last row, but she can still move her chip to capture Bob's chip. However, the program outputs "Draw" instead of "Alice".

The program's logic is flawed because it only checks if Alice's chip is in the last row or if Bob's chip is in the first row, but it does not consider the possibility that Alice can still make a move to capture Bob's chip even if she is in the last row.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to correctly determine the outcome of the game in all cases.
