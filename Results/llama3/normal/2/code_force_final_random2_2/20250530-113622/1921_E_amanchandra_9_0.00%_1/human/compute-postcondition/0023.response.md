The code prints either 'Draw' or 'Alice' based on the conditions `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`. 

Here, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`, `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`, `x` is the integer half of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`, and `ya` is an integer.

Since the exact values of `l`, `r`, `x`, and `ya` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the conditions. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either 'Draw' or 'Alice' depending on whether the conditions are met.

Output: **either 'Draw' or 'Alice' (where 'Draw' is printed if the conditions are not met, and 'Alice' is printed if the conditions are met)**
