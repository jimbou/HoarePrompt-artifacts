Postcondition: ***t is greater than 2, i is 2, h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb are integers that have been assigned values from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If xa is greater than xb, 'Draw' is printed. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between xa and xb is odd, either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed based on the conditions abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1 where l is the maximum of 1 and yb - x, r is the minimum of w and yb + x. If the absolute difference between xa and xb is even, either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between l and yb is less than or equal to x and the absolute difference between r and yb is less than or equal to x where l is the maximum of 1 and ya - x, r is the minimum of w and yb + x.***
