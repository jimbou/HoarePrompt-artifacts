Output State: **t is greater than 1, i is 1, h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb are integers that have been assigned values from the input, x is the integer half of the absolute difference between xa and xb, l is the maximum value between 1 and ya minus x, r is the minimum value between w and yb plus x, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `x` is also unchanged as it is not reassigned. The code introduces two new variables, `l` and `r`, which are assigned values based on the existing variables. The value of `l` is the maximum value between 1 and `ya` minus `x`, and the value of `r` is the minimum value between `w` and `yb` plus `x`. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1.
