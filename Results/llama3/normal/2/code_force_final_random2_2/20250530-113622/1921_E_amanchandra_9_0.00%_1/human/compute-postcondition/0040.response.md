Output: **t is greater than 2, i is 2, h, w, xa, xb, ya, yb are integers, x is the integer part of half the absolute difference between xa and xb, l is the maximum of 1 and ya - x, r is the minimum of w and yb + x, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, and either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between l and yb is less than or equal to x and the absolute difference between r and yb is less than or equal to x**
