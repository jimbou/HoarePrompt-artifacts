The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the number of test cases in the input. If `i` is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers that have been assigned values from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases**
