Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers, `x` is the integer part of half of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`, and the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even***
