To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `b` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `b` to be greater than 0.

State: **`T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` must be greater than 0, `info` is a list of strings equal to the input, `suma` is 0, `i` is 1**
