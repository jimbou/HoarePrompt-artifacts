Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions.

The program first reads the number of test cases T and then for each test case, it reads two positive integers n and m. It then calculates the sum of ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1 for all i from 1 to b where a - i * (i - 1) is greater than 0. This sum represents the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions.

The program then prints the sum minus 1, which is the correct answer.

The commented out code is not necessary for the correctness of the program, it seems to be a debugging or testing code.

Correctness: **True**
