Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions. The issue lies in the line `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. This line is attempting to calculate the number of possible values of `a` for a given `i`, but it does not take into account the fact that `a` must be a multiple of `i`.

For example, when `a = 10` and `i = 2`, the program calculates `x = (10 - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2 ** 2 + 1 = 3`. However, the only possible values of `a` that satisfy the conditions are `a = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10`, which is 5 values, not 3.

Therefore, the program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions, and the correctness is **False**.
