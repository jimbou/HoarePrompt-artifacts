To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, b + 1):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `b`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `b`. If `i` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `b` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `b` is greater than 1, it must also be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables in the state (`T`, `t`, `a`, `info`, `x`, and `suma`) are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is greater than 2, `info` is a list of strings equal to the input, `i` is 3, `x` is ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2), `suma` is ((a - i*(i-1))//i^2)+1 + ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2) if `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, otherwise `suma` remains unchanged**
