Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is greater than 1, `info` is a list of strings, `x` is ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2) + 1 if `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, otherwise `x` is ((a - 0 * (0 - 1)) // 0 ** 2 + 1)**

In this output state, the value of `x` is calculated based on the initial values of `a` and `i`. If `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, then `x` is equal to ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2) + 1, which is the same as the initial value of `suma` and `x`. Otherwise, `x` is equal to ((a - 0 * (0 - 1)) // 0 ** 2 + 1), which is a new value. The other variables remain unchanged.
