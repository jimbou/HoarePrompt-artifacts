To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `b + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `b` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `b` is not changed by the loop, its state remains the same, but for the loop to execute again, `b` must be greater than 1.

The states of other variables (`T`, `t`, `a`, `suma`, and `x`) are not directly affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is greater than 1, `info` is a list of strings equal to the input, `suma` is ((a - i*(i-1))//i^2)+1 or 0, `i` is 2, `x` is ((a - i*(i-1))//i^2)+1 or 0**
