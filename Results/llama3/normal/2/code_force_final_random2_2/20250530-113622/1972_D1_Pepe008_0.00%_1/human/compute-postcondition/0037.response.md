To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `t` and `T`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `t` is less than `T`. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is 1, and `T` is greater than 1. To execute the loop again, `t` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `info` is a list of strings equal to the input, `i` is `b` + 1, `x` is ((`a` - `b` * (`b` - 1)) // `b`^2) + 1, `suma` is the sum of ((`a` - `i` * (`i` - 1)) // `i`^2) + 1 for all `i` from 1 to `b` where `a` - `i` * (`i` - 1) is greater than 0, and the value of `suma` - 1 is being printed**
