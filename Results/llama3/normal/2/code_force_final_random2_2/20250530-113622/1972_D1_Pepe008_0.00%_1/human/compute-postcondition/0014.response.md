Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is greater than 1, `info` is a list of strings, `x` is ((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1, `suma` is increased by ((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1)**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `suma` is increased by the value of `x`, which is calculated as ((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1). The values of `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and `info` remain unchanged.
