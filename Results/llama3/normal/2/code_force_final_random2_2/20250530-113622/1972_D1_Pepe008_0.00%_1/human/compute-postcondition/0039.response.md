To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`. The loop will execute if `b` is at least 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `b` (inclusive). 

Before the loop starts, `i` is `b + 1`, which is outside the range of the loop. So, we need to adjust `i` to be within the range of the loop. The smallest value `i` can take is 1.

State: **`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input and must be at least 1, `info` is a list of strings equal to the input, `i` is 1, `x` is ((a - b * (b - 1)) // b^2) + 1, `suma` is the sum of ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1 for all i from 1 to b where a - i * (i - 1) is greater than 0, and the value of suma - 1 is being printed, `suma` is 0**
