To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `b`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `b` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `b` is at least 2, it must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables, `T`, `t`, `a`, `info`, `x`, and `suma`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input and must be greater than 2, `info` is a list of strings equal to the input, `i` is 3, `x` is ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2^2) + 1 which is equal to (a - 2) // 4 + 1. If a - i * (i - 1) > 0, then `suma` is the sum of ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1 for all i from 1 to b where a - i * (i - 1) is greater than 0 plus ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2^2) + 1 which is equal to (a - 2) // 4 + 1. Otherwise, `suma` remains unchanged.**
