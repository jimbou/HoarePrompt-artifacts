Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is greater than 0, `info` is a list of strings, `suma` is ((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1), `i` is 1, `x` is ((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1), and the current value of `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0.**

The code `suma += x` adds the value of `x` to `suma`. Since `x` is equal to `((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1)`, which is equivalent to `(a - 0) // 1` or simply `a`, the value of `suma` becomes `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
