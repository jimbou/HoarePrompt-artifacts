Output State: **T is greater than 1, t is 1, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, info is a list of strings equal to the input, i is b + 1, x is ((a - b * (b - 1)) // b^2) + 1, suma is the sum of ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1 for all i from 1 to b where a - i * (i - 1) is greater than 0.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables T, t, a, b, and info remain unchanged from their initial values. The variable i has reached the value of b + 1, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations. The variable x has been updated to its final value based on the last iteration of the loop. The variable suma has been updated to include the sum of all the values of x for which a - i * (i - 1) is greater than 0, for all i from 1 to b.
