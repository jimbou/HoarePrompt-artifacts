Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input and must be greater than 2, `info` is a list of strings equal to the input, `i` is 3, `x` is ((a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3^2) + 1 which is equal to (a - 6) // 9 + 1. If a - i * (i - 1) > 0, `suma` is the sum of ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1 for all i from 1 to b where a - i * (i - 1) is greater than 0 plus ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2^2) + 1 which is equal to (a - 2) // 4 + 1 plus ((a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3^2) + 1 which is equal to (a - 6) // 9 + 1. Otherwise, `suma` remains unchanged.**
