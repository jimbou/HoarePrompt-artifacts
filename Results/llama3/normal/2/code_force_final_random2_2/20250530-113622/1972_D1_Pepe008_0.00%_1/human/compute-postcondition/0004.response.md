Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is greater than 0, `info` is a list of strings, `suma` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is ((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1 ** 2 + 1)**

In this output state, the value of `x` is calculated using the given formula, where `a` is an integer, `i` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
