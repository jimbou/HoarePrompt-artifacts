The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `b`. If `i` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `b` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `b` must be greater than 1.
State: **`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input and must be at least 2, `info` is a list of strings equal to the input, `i` is 2, `x` is ((a - 1 * (2 - 1)) // 2^2) + 1 which is equal to a, `suma` is the sum of ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1 for all i from 1 to b where a - i * (i - 1) is greater than 0. If a - i * (i - 1) > 0, then the value of suma - 1 is being printed and `suma` is a + 1**
