Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is greater than 1, `info` is a list of strings, `x` is ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2) + 1 if `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, otherwise `x` is ((a - 0 * (0 - 1)) // 0), `suma` is increased by `x`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `suma` is increased by the value of `x`, which depends on the value of `a` and the condition `a - i * (i - 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
