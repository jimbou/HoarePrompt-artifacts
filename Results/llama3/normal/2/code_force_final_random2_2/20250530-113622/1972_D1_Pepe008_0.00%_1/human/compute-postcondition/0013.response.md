Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is greater than 1, `info` is a list of strings, `x` is ((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1 ** 2) + 1, `suma` is increased by ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2) + 1 if `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: `T` is still greater than 0, `t` remains 0, `a` is still an integer, `b` is still greater than 1, `info` is still a list of strings, `x` is now calculated as ((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1 ** 2) + 1, `suma` is increased by ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2) + 1 if `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, and `i` remains 1.
