The code prints the value of `suma` minus 1. Where `suma` is the sum of ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1 for all i from 1 to b where a - i * (i - 1) is greater than 0, a is the first integer from the input, and b is the second integer from the input.
Output: **suma - 1 (where suma is the sum of ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1 for all i from 1 to b where a - i * (i - 1) is greater than 0, a is the first integer from the input, and b is the second integer from the input)**
