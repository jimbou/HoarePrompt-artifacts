To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `b`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `b` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.

The state of `b` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables, `T`, `a`, `info`, `x`, and `suma`, are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is greater than 1, `info` is a list of strings, `x` is ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2) + 1 if `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, otherwise `x` is ((a - 0 * (0 - 1)) // 0), and `suma` is increased by `x` if `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
