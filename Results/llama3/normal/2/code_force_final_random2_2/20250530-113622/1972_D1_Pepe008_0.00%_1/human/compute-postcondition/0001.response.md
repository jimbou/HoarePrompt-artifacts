The only variable in the loop head is `t` and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `T` is a positive integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `T` is greater than 0 and `t` is now 0. 
State: **`T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0**
