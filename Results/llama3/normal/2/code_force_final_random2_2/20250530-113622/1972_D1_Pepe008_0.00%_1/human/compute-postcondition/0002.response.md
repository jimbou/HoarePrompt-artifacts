Output State: **T is greater than 0, t is 0, a is an integer, b is an integer, info is a list of strings, suma is 0**

Explanation: The first line of code reads a line of input from stdin and splits it into a list of strings, which is assigned to the variable `info`. The second line extracts the first two elements of `info`, converts them to integers, and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`, respectively. The commented-out code block does not affect the state of the program. The third line initializes the variable `suma` to 0. The values of `T` and `t` are not modified by the code, so they remain unchanged.
