Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is greater than 0, `info` is a list of strings equal to the input, `suma` is ((a - i*(i-1))//i^2)+1, `i` is 1, `x` is ((a - i*(i-1))//i^2)+1.**

In natural language, the output state is: `T` is still greater than 1, `t` remains 1, `a` is still the first integer from the input, `b` is still greater than 0, `info` is still a list of strings equal to the input, `suma` has been updated to be the value of `x` which is ((a - i*(i-1))//i^2)+1, `i` remains 1, and `x` remains ((a - i*(i-1))//i^2)+1.
