The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `b`. If `i` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `b` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `b` must be greater than 1.
State: **`T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is greater than 1, `info` is a list of strings. If `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, then `suma` is ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2), `i` is 2, and `x` is ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2). Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
