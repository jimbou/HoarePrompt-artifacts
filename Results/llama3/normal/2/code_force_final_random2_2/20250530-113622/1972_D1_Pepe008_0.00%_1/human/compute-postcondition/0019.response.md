To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for t in range(T):`. This means we can only adjust the states of `t` and `T`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is 0, and `T` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `t` needs to be incremented by 1, and `T` must be greater than the new value of `t`.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `t` is 1, and `T` must be greater than 1.

The states of other variables (`a`, `b`, `info`, and `suma`) are not affected by the loop head, so they remain the same.

State: **`T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `info` is a list of strings, `suma` is the sum of ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) + 1 for all i in range(1, b + 1) where a - i * (i - 1) > 0**
