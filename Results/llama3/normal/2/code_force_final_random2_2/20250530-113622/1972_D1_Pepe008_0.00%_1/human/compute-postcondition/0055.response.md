Output State: **T is greater than or equal to 0, t is T, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, info is a list of strings equal to the input, i is b + 1, x is ((a - b * (b - 1)) // b^2) + 1, suma is the sum of ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1 for all i from 1 to b where a - i * (i - 1) is greater than 0, and the value of suma - 1 is being printed**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations, and the variables have reached their final values. The loop counter `t` has reached the value of `T`, which is the number of test cases. The variables `a`, `b`, and `info` have retained their values from the last iteration of the loop. The variable `i` has reached the value of `b + 1`, indicating that the inner loop has completed its execution. The variable `x` has been calculated based on the values of `a` and `b`. The variable `suma` has been calculated as the sum of the values of `x` for all `i` from 1 to `b` where `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0. Finally, the value of `suma - 1` is being printed as the output of the program.
