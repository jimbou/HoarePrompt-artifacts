Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is greater than 2, `info` is a list of strings equal to the input, `i` is 3, `x` is ((a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3^2) + 1. If `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, `suma` is ((a - i*(i-1))//i^2)+1 + ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2) + ((a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3^2) + 1. Otherwise, `suma` is ((a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3^2) + 1.***
