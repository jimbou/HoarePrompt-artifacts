Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input and must be at least 1, `info` is a list of strings equal to the input, `i` is 1, `x` is ((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1^2) + 1 which is equal to a + 1, `suma` is the sum of ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1 for all i from 1 to b where a - i * (i - 1) is greater than 0, and the value of suma - 1 is being printed, `suma` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `T` is still greater than 2, `t` is still 2, `a` and `b` are still integers equal to the first and second integers from the input respectively, `info` is still a list of strings equal to the input, `i` is still 1, `x` is now equal to `a + 1`, `suma` is still 0 and the value of `suma - 1` is being printed.
