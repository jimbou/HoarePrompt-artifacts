Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input and must be at least 2, `info` is a list of strings equal to the input, `i` is 2, `x` is ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2^2) + 1 which is equal to (a - 2) // 4 + 1, `suma` is the sum of ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1 for all i from 1 to b where a - i * (i - 1) is greater than 0 plus ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2^2) + 1 which is equal to (a - 2) // 4 + 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `suma` has been updated by adding the value of `x` to it. The value of `x` is calculated as ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2^2) + 1 which is equal to (a - 2) // 4 + 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
