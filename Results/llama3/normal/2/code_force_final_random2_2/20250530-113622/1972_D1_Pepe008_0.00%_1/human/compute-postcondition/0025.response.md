Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is greater than 0, `info` is a list of strings equal to the input. If `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, then `suma` is ((a - i*(i-1))//i^2)+1, `i` is 1, `x` is ((a - i*(i-1))//i^2)+1. Otherwise, `suma` is 0.***
