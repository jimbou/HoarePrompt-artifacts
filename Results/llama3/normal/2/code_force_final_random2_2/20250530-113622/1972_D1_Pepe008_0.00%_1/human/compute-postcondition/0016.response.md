Output State: **T is greater than 0, t is 0, a is an integer, b is an integer, info is a list of strings, suma is the sum of ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) + 1 for all i in range(1, b + 1) where a - i * (i - 1) > 0**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `suma` has been updated to be the sum of the values of `x` for all iterations where `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0. The values of `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and `info` remain unchanged.
