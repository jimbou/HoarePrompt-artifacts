Output State: **T is greater than 2, t is 2, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, info is a list of strings equal to the input, i is b, x is ((a - b * (b - 1)) // b^2) + 1, suma is the sum of ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1 for all i from 1 to b where a - i * (i - 1) is greater than 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- `T` remains greater than 2.
- `t` remains equal to 2.
- `a` remains equal to the first integer from the input.
- `b` remains equal to the second integer from the input.
- `info` remains a list of strings equal to the input.
- `i` is now equal to `b`, indicating that the loop has iterated `b` times.
- `x` is calculated based on the last iteration, which is `((a - b * (b - 1)) // b^2) + 1`.
- `suma` is the cumulative sum of `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2) + 1` for all `i` from 1 to `b` where `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0. This means that `suma` now includes the contributions from all iterations of the loop.
