Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer larger than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first two space-separated integers n and m, and then a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G'. n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    ans = 0
    p = 'ABCDEF'
    hmp = Counter(s)
    for i in p:
        if i not in hmp:
            ans += m
    for i in hmp:
        if hmp[i] < m:
            ans += m - hmp[i]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string, p is 'ABCDEF', hmp is a dictionary with character frequencies of s, i is the last key in hmp. If 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F' are not in hmp, then ans is 6*m. Otherwise, ans is increased by m - hmp[i] for each key i in hmp where the frequency of i in hmp is less than m, and the value of ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is at least 2, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string, p is 'ABCDEF', hmp is a dictionary with character frequencies of s, i is the last key in hmp, ans is the sum of m for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in hmp plus the sum of m - hmp[j] for each key j in hmp where hmp[j] is less than m, and ans is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is at least 3, _ is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string, p is 'ABCDEF', hmp is a dictionary with character frequencies of s, i is the last key in hmp, and ans is increased by m - hmp[i] for each key-value pair in hmp where the value is less than m, and the sum of the differences between m and the frequency of each character in s that is less than m is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
