Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary with character frequencies of `s` that must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `i` is the second key in `hmp`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]` if `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still at least 3, `_` is still 2, there are still `t-4` test cases in stdin, `n` and `m` are still integers, `s` is still a string, `p` is still 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is still a dictionary with character frequencies of `s` with at least 2 key-value pairs, `i` is still the second key in `hmp`, and `ans` has been increased by the difference between `m` and the frequency of the character `i` in `s`, but only if the frequency of `i` is less than `m`.
