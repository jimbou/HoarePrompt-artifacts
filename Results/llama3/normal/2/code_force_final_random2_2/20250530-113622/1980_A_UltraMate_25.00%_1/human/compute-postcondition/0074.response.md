Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary with character frequencies of `s` that must have at least 3 key-value pairs, `i` is the third key in `hmp`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding the difference between `m` and the frequency of the character `i` in the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-4` test cases, and the dictionary `hmp` still has at least 3 key-value pairs representing the character frequencies of `s`.
