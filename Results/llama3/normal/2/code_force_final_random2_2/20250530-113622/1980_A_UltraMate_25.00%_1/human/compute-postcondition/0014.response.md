To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `hmp`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the dictionary `hmp`. If `hmp` is not empty, the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary with character frequencies of `s` that must not be empty, `i` is a key in `hmp`**
