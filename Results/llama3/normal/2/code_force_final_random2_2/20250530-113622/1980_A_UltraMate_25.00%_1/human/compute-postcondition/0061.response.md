Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary with character frequencies of `s`, `i` is 'B', and `ans` is not printed. If `i` is not in `hmp`, then `ans` is `ans` plus `m` and has not been printed. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
