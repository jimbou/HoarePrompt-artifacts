Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the number of problems in the bank (n) is less than the number of upcoming rounds (m). In this case, the program will output a negative number, which is incorrect. The program should output the difference between the number of upcoming rounds and the number of problems in the bank.

For example, if the input is:

3
5 10
BGECDCBDED

The program will output -5, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 5, because Vlad needs to come up with 5 more problems to hold 10 rounds.
