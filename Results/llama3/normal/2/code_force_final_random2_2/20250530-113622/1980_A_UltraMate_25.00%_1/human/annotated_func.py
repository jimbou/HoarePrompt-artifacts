#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first two space-separated integers n and m, and then a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G'. n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        ans = 0
        
        p = 'ABCDEF'
        
        hmp = Counter(s)
        
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
        
        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: t is 0, _ is t-1, stdin is empty, n is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string, p is 'ABCDEF', hmp is a dictionary with character frequencies of s, i is the last key in hmp, and ans is increased by m - hmp[i] for each key-value pair in hmp where the value is less than m, and the sum of the differences between m and the frequency of each character in s that is less than m is printed

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers (n and m) and a string (s) of n characters. It then calculates the total number of characters that need to be added to the string to make the frequency of each character at least m, and prints this total for each test case.
