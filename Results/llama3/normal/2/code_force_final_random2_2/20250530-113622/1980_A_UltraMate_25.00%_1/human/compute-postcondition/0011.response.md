Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary with character frequencies of `s`, `i` is 'C', `ans` is increased by `m`**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been increased by the value of `m`. The other variables remain unchanged, retaining their initial values and properties. The stdin still contains `t-2` test cases, and the dictionary `hmp` still stores the character frequencies of the string `s`.
