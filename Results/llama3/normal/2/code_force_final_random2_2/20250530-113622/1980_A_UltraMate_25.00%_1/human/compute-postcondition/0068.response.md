Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary with character frequencies of `s` that must have at least 1 key-value pair, `i` is the first key in `hmp`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`, and `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding the difference between `m` and the frequency of character `i` in string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `p`, and `hmp` are still valid.
