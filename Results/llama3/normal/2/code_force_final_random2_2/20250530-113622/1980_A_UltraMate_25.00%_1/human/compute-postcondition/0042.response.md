The code `ans += m - hmp[i]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the difference between `m` and the value of `hmp[i]`. Since the current value of `hmp[i]` is less than the current value of `m`, the difference `m - hmp[i]` is positive.

Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary with character frequencies of `s` that must have at least 1 key-value pair, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in `hmp` plus `m - hmp[i]`, `i` is the first key in `hmp`.**
