Output: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string, p is 'ABCDEF', hmp is a dictionary with character frequencies of s, i is the last key in hmp. If 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F' are not in hmp, then ans is 6*m. Otherwise, ans is increased by m - hmp[i] for each key i in hmp where the frequency of i in hmp is less than m, and the value of ans is being printed**
