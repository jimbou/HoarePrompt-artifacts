The only variable in the loop head is variable  _ and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, t is at least 2. For the loop to execute again _ must be increased by 1 so _ is 2 and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 2.
State: **t is at least 3, _ is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string, p is 'ABCDEF', hmp is a dictionary with character frequencies of s, i is the last key in hmp, ans is the sum of m for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in hmp plus the sum of m - hmp[j] for each key j in hmp where hmp[j] is less than m, and ans is printed**
