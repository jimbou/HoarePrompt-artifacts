Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary with character frequencies of `s`, `i` is 'B', and `ans` is `ans` plus `m` and has not been printed.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `m` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1, from t-4 to t-5.
