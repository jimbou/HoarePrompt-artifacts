Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary with character frequencies of `s`, `i` is 'A', `ans` is increased by `m`, and `ans` is not printed. The current value of `i` is not present in `hmp`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been increased by the value of `m`, but the values of all other variables remain the same. The current value of `i` is still not present in the dictionary `hmp`.
