Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary with character frequencies of `s`. If the character 'B' is not present in the dictionary `hmp`, then `ans` is `m+m`. If the character 'B' is present in the dictionary `hmp`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
