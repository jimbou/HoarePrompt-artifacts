The `print(ans)` statement will print the calculated value of `ans`, which is the sum of two parts:

1. The sum of `m` for each character in `'ABCDEF'` that is not present in `hmp`. This means that for each character in `'ABCDEF'` that does not have a corresponding key in the `hmp` dictionary, the value of `m` is added to the sum.
2. The sum of `m - hmp[j]` for each key `j` in `hmp` where `hmp[j]` is less than `m`. This means that for each key `j` in `hmp` where the value of `hmp[j]` is less than `m`, the difference between `m` and `hmp[j]` is added to the sum.

Since the exact values of `m`, `hmp`, and the characters in `'ABCDEF'` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`, which represents the sum of the two parts described above.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of m for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in hmp plus the sum of m - hmp[j] for each key j in hmp where hmp[j] is less than m)**
