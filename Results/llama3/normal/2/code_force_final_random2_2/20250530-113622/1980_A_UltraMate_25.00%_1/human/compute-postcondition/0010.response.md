To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `p`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is not the last character in `p`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 'B', which is the second character in `p`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be the next character in `p`, which is 'C'.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary with character frequencies of `s`, `i` is 'C'**
