Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary with character frequencies of `s` that must not be empty, `i` is a key in `hmp`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`, and the current value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is increased by the difference between `m` and the current frequency of character `i` in string `s`, which is stored in the dictionary `hmp`. All other variables remain unchanged.
