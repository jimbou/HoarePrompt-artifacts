Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary with character frequencies of `s` that must not be empty, `i` is the next key in `hmp`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is increased by the difference between `m` and the frequency of character `i` in string `s`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
