The code `ans += m` adds the value of `m` to the current value of `ans`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `ans`, we can only say that `ans` is increased by the value of `m`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary with character frequencies of `s`, `i` is 'C', and `ans` is increased by the value of `m`.**
