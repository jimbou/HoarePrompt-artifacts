Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary with character frequencies of `s`, if the character 'A' is not present in the dictionary `hmp`, then `ans` is `m+m`, `i` is 'B'**

The code increments the value of `ans` by `m`. Since `ans` is initially `m` if the character 'A' is not present in the dictionary `hmp`, the new value of `ans` is `m+m`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
