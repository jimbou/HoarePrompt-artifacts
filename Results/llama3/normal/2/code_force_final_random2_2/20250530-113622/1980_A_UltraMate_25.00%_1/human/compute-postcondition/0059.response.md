The only object in the loop head is variable `i` and string `p`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `p`. If `i` is less than the length of `p`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 'A', `p` is 'ABCDEF'. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be the next character in `p`, which is 'B'.
State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary with character frequencies of `s`, `i` is 'B', and `ans` is not printed.**
