The code `ans += m` increments the value of `ans` by `m`. Initially, `ans` is 0, so the new value of `ans` will be `m`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary with character frequencies of `s`, `ans` is `m`, and the current value of `i` is 'A', which is not present in the dictionary `hmp`.**
