Postcondition: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary with character frequencies of `s` that must have at least 1 key-value pair, `i` is the first key in `hmp`, and `ans` is not printed. The current value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.**
