To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in hmp:`. This means we're iterating over the keys of the dictionary `hmp`. For the loop to execute again, there must be another key in `hmp` that hasn't been processed yet.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `t` is at least 2
- `_` is 1
- `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases
- `n` is an integer
- `m` is an integer
- `s` is a string
- `p` is 'ABCDEF'
- `hmp` is a dictionary with character frequencies of `s` that must have at least 1 key-value pair
- `i` is the first key in `hmp`
- `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in `hmp` plus `m - hmp[i]` if `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, otherwise `ans` remains the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in `hmp`

For the loop to execute again, `hmp` must have at least one more key-value pair that hasn't been processed. Since `i` is the first key in `hmp` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be the next key in `hmp`, and `hmp` must have at least two key-value pairs.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary with character frequencies of `s` that must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `i` is the second key in `hmp`**
