The code `ans += m` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `m`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `ans`, we can only conclude that the value of `ans` is increased by `m`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary with character frequencies of `s`, `i` is 'B', `ans` is increased by `m`**
