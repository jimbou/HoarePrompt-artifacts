Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary with character frequencies of `s` that must have at least one more key, `i` is the next key in `hmp`. If the frequency of `i` in `hmp` is less than `m`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.***
