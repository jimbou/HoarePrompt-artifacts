The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `p`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `p`. If `i` is less than `p`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 'A', `p` is 'ABCDEF'. For the loop to execute again `i` is 'B' and `p` is 'ABCDEF'.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary with character frequencies of `s`, `i` is 'B', `ans` is `m`**
