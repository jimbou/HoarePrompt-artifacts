Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first two space-separated integers n and m, and then a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G'. n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5.**

In this output state, the variable `t` is assigned the value of the first input, which is an integer larger than 0. The stdin now contains t-1 test cases, each with two space-separated integers n and m, and a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G'. The values of n and m are still constrained to be between 1 and 50, and 1 and 5, respectively.
