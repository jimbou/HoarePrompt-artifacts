Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary with character frequencies of `s` that must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `i` is the second key in `hmp`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding the difference between `m` and the frequency of the character `i` in the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now `ans + m - hmp[i]`, where `hmp[i]` is the frequency of the character `i` in the string `s`.
