The only object in the loop head is variable `hmp`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `hmp`. If `hmp` has at least one more key the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `hmp` has at least one key, `i` is the next key in `hmp`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `hmp` must have at least one more key and `i` is the next key in `hmp`.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary with character frequencies of `s` that must have at least one more key, `i` is the next key in `hmp`**
