Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary with character frequencies of `s` that must have at least 3 key-value pairs, `i` is the third key in `hmp`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]` if the frequency of `i` in `hmp` is less than `m`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still at least 2, the value of `_` is still 1, the number of test cases in `stdin` is still `t-3`, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `p` are unchanged, `hmp` is still a dictionary with character frequencies of `s` that must have at least 3 key-value pairs, `i` is still the third key in `hmp`. The value of `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]` if the frequency of `i` in `hmp` is less than `m`.
