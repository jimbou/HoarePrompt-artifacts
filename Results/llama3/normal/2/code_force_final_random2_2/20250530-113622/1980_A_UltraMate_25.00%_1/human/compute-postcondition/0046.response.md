Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary with character frequencies of `s` that must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `i` is the second key in `hmp`. If the frequency of `i` in `hmp` is less than `m`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.***
