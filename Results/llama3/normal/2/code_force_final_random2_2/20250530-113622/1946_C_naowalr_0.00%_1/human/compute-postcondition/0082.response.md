Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is 0, a and b are integers, adj[a] contains b n - 1 times, adj[b] contains a n - 1 times, x is (L + R) // 2, numCuts is 0, leftover is the return value of dfs(1, 1), stdin contains no input. If numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), then L is (L + R) // 2 and R is either 1 and 50001 or 50001 and 100001 depending on the values of numCuts and leftover. Otherwise, L is either 1 or 50001 and R is (L + R) // 2.***
