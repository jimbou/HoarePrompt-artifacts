Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is 0, a and b are integers, adj[a] contains b n - 1 times, adj[b] contains a n - 1 times, x is (L + R) // 2, numCuts is 0, leftover is the return value of dfs(1, 1), stdin contains no input. If numCuts is greater than k or (numCuts equals k and leftover is greater than or equal to x), then L is set to (L + R) // 2. Otherwise, R is set to (L + R) // 2.***
