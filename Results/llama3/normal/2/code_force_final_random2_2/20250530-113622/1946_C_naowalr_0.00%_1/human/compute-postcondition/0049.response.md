Output State: **L is either 1 or 50001, R is either greater than 2 or greater than 50002, x is the average of L and R, numCuts is 0, leftover is the return value of dfs(1, 1), z is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, a is an integer, b is an integer, i is n - 1**

The code block modifies the values of `x`, `numCuts`, and `leftover`. The first line calculates the average of `L` and `R` and assigns it to `x`. The second line resets `numCuts` to 0. The third line calls the `dfs` function with arguments 1 and 1, and assigns its return value to `leftover`. The other variables remain unchanged.
