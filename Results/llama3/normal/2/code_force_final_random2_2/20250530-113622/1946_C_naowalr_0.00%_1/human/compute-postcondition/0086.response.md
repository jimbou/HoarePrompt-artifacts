Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers, `adj[a]` contains `b` `n - 1` times, `adj[b]` contains `a` `n - 1` times, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`, `R` is `(L + R) // 2`, `L` is at least `(L + R) // 2 - 2`**

In this output state, the value of `R` has been updated to be equal to `x`, which is the average of `L` and `R`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that since `R` is now equal to `x`, which is the average of `L` and `R`, `L` must be at least `(L + R) // 2 - 2` to satisfy the condition that `R` is at least `L + 2`.
