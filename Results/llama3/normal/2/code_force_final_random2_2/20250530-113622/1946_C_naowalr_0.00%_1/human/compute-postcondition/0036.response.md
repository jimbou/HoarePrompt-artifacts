Output State: **L is the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), R is the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts <= k and (numCuts is not equal to k or leftover < x), x is the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), numCuts is 0, leftover is the return value of dfs(1, 1), z is 1, n is an integer that must be at least 3, k is an integer, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, a is an integer, b is an integer, i is 1, stdin is empty**

The code reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `a` and `b`. It then appends `b` to the list at index `a` in `adj` and appends `a` to the list at index `b` in `adj`. This modifies the `adj` list by adding a new edge between `a` and `b`. The values of `L`, `R`, `x`, `numCuts`, `leftover`, `z`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. Stdin is now empty since the code has read the two integers.
