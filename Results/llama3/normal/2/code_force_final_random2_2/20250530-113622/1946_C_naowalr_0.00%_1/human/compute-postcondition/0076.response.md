Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers, `adj[a]` contains `b` `n - 1` times, `adj[b]` contains `a` `n - 1` times, `L` is 1, `R` is 50001, `x` is 50001, `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and (`numCuts` is not equal to `k` or `leftover` is less than 50001), stdin contains no input**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `R` has been updated to 50001, which is the value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `adj[a]`, `adj[b]`, `L`, `numCuts`, and `leftover` are still valid. The input stream remains empty.
