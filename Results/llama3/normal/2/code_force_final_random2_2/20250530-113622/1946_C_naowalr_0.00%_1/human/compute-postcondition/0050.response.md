Output State: **`L` is the average of the initial `L` and `R`, `R` is either greater than 2 or greater than 50002, `x` is the average of the initial `L` and `R`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`, `z` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` contains `b` and the list at index `b` contains `a`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `i` is `n - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `L` has been updated to be the average of its initial value and the value of `R`. All other variables remain unchanged, with `R` still being greater than 2 or greater than 50002, and `x` also being the average of the initial `L` and `R`. The rest of the variables maintain their initial values and properties.
