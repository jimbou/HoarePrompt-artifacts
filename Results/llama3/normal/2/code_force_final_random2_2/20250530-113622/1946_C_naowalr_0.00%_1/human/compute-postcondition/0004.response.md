Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is a positive integer and must be at least 2, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, z is 0, i is 0, stdin has no more lines of input**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `z`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The `adj` list is updated to reflect the addition of `b` to the list at index `a` and `a` to the list at index `b`. The stdin remains empty as there are no more lines of input.
