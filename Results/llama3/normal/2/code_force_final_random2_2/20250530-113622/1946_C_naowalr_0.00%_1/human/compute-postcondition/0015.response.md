Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a for all pairs (a, b) read from stdin, z is 0, i is n - 1, a is an integer, b is an integer, a and b are connected in adj, L is 1, R is 100001, numCuts is less than or equal to k and (numCuts is not equal to k or leftover is less than x), x is 50001, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1)***
