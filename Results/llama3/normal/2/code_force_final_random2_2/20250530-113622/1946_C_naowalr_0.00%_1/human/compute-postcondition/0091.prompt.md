Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer read from stdin, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` < `n`, `adj` is a list of lists of integers representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, and stdin has one less line of input.
Code of the loop:
for z in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    L = 1
    R = int(100000.0 + 1)
    numCuts = 0
    while R - L > 1:
        x = (L + R) // 2
        numCuts = 0
        leftover = dfs(1, 1)
        if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
            L = x
        else:
            R = x
    print(L)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: L is the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), R is the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts <= k and (numCuts is not equal to k or leftover < x), x is the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), numCuts is 0, leftover is the return value of dfs(1, 1), and the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x) which is L is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: L is the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), R is L + 1, x is the average of L and R, numCuts is 0, leftover is the return value of dfs(1, 1), z is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, a is an integer, b is an integer, i is n - 1, and the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x) which is L is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: L is the smallest value x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), R is the smallest value x such that numCuts <= k and (numCuts < k or leftover < x), n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is 0, a and b are integers, adj[a] contains b n - 1 times, adj[b] contains a n - 1 times, x is (L + R) // 2, numCuts is 0, leftover is the return value of dfs(1, 1), stdin contains no input, and L is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
