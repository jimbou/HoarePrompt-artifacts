Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers, `adj[a]` contains `b` `n - 1` times, `adj[b]` contains `a` `n - 1` times, `L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, `x` is 50001, the current value of `numCuts` is either greater than `k` or equals `k`, and the current value of `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50001, and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `L` has been updated to 50001, which is the value of `x`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
