Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a for all pairs (a, b) read from stdin, z is 0, i is n - 1, a is an integer, b is an integer, a and b are connected in adj, L is 1, R is 100001, numCuts is 0**

The code introduces three new variables: L, R, and numCuts. L is assigned the value 1, R is assigned the value 100001 (which is the result of int(100000.0 + 1)), and numCuts is initialized to 0. The values of t, n, k, adj, z, i, a, and b remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
