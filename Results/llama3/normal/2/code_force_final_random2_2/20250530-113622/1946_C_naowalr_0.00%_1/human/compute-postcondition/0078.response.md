According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables R and L. If R - L is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, R - L is greater than 1. However, this does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so we need to adjust R - L to be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is 0, a and b are integers, adj[a] contains b n - 1 times, adj[b] contains a n - 1 times, x is 50001, stdin contains no input. If numCuts is greater than k or (numCuts is equal to k and leftover is greater than or equal to 50001), then L is 50001 and R is 100001. Otherwise, L is 1 and R is 50001. R - L must be greater than 1**
