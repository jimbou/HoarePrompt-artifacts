Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a for all pairs (a, b) read from stdin, z is 0, i is n - 1, a is an integer, b is an integer, a and b are connected in adj, L is 1, R is 100001, numCuts is 0
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a for all pairs (a, b) read from stdin, z is 0, i is n - 1, a is an integer, b is an integer, a and b are connected in adj, if the current value of numCuts is greater than k or the current value of numCuts is equal to k and the current value of leftover is greater than or equal to 50001, then L is 50001 and R is 100001. Otherwise, L is 1 and R is 50001, numCuts is less than or equal to k and (numCuts is not equal to k or leftover is less than 50001), x is 50001, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1).
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a for all pairs (a, b) read from stdin, z is 0, i is n - 1, a is an integer, b is an integer, a and b are connected in adj, numCuts is 0, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1), x is (L + R) // 2, L is 1 and R is 50001, or L is 50001 and R is 100001. If numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), then L is updated to x which is (L + R) // 2. Otherwise, R is updated to x which is (L + R) // 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *L and R are unchanged, x is the integer value of the average of L and R, numCuts is 0, leftover is the return value of dfs(1, 1). If numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), then L is the integer value of the average of the original L and R, R is unchanged, x is the integer value of the average of the original L and R. Otherwise, L is unchanged, R is the integer value of the average of L and the original R, x is the integer value of the average of L and the original R.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
