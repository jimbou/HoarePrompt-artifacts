According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `R` and `L`. If `R - L > 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `L` is either 1 or 50001, `R` is either 100001 or 50001. For the loop to execute one more time, `R` must be greater than `L + 1`. Since `L` is either 1 or 50001, `R` must be greater than 2 or 50002. 

State: **`L` is either 1 or 50001, `R` is either greater than 2 or greater than 50002, `x` is 50001, `numCuts` is either greater than `k` or equals `k` with `leftover` greater than or equal to `x`, or `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` with `leftover` less than 50001, `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`, `z` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` contains `b` and the list at index `b` contains `a`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `i` is `n - 1**
