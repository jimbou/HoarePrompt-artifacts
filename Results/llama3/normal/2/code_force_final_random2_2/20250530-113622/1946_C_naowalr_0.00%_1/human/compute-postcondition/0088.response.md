Output State: **L is the smallest value x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), R is the smallest value x such that numCuts <= k and (numCuts < k or leftover < x), n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is 0, a and b are integers, adj[a] contains b n - 1 times, adj[b] contains a n - 1 times, x is (L + R) // 2, numCuts is 0, leftover is the return value of dfs(1, 1), stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that L and R have converged to the smallest value x such that the condition numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x) is true, and the other variables remain unchanged.
