Output State: **L is the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), R is the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts <= k and (numCuts is not equal to k or leftover < x), x is the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), numCuts is 0, leftover is the return value of dfs(1, 1), z is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, adj is a list of n + 1 empty lists, and the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x) which is L is being printed.**

The code snippet reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `k`. It then creates a list of `n + 1` empty lists and assigns it to `adj`. The values of `L`, `R`, `x`, `numCuts`, `leftover`, and `z` remain unchanged. The minimum possible value of `x` such that `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`) is still being printed.
