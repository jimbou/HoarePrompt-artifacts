The only variable in the loop head is `z` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` < `n`, `adj` is a list of lists of integers representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, and stdin has one less line of input. So for the loop to be executed `t` must be greater than 0 and `z` is now 0.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` < `n`, `adj` is a list of lists of integers representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, stdin has one less line of input, `z` is 0**
