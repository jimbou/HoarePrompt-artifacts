Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, constructs an adjacency list of a tree with n vertices, and performs a binary search to find the minimum possible value of x such that the number of cuts in the tree is greater than k or the number of cuts is equal to k and the leftover value is greater than or equal to x. The function then prints this minimum value of x.**
