Output State: **L is the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), R is the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts <= k and (numCuts is not equal to k or leftover < x), x is the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), numCuts is 0, leftover is the return value of dfs(1, 1), z is 1, n is an integer that must be at least 3, k is an integer, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, a is an integer, b is an integer, i is 2, stdin is empty**

The code reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to a and b. Since stdin is empty, this operation does not change the state of stdin. The code then appends b to the list at index a in adj and appends a to the list at index b in adj. This modifies the state of adj, adding a new edge between a and b. No other variables are affected.
