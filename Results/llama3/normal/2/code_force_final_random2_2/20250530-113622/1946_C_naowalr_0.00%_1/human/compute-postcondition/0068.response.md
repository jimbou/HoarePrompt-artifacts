Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, i is n - 1, a and b are integers, adj[a] contains b three times, adj[b] contains a three times, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to be the two integers read from `stdin`, which is now empty. The adjacency lists `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` are updated to contain each other's values three times, as the code appends `b` to `adj[a]` and `a` to `adj[b]`, in addition to the two existing occurrences of each value.
