To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 1, and `n` must still be at least 2.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 2, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` < `n`, `adj` is a list of `n+1` lists where the list at index `a` contains `b` and the list at index `b` contains `a`, `z` is 0, `i` is 1, stdin has no more lines of input**
