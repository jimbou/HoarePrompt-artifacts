Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers, `adj[a]` contains `b` `n - 1` times, `adj[b]` contains `a` `n - 1` times, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is `(L + R) // 2`, `R` is at least `L + 2`, stdin contains no input**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `L` has been updated to be the average of the original `L` and `R`, which is `(L + R) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged. The graph structure represented by `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` is still the same, and the values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `numCuts`, and `leftover` are unchanged. The stdin still contains no input, and `R` is still at least `L + 2`.
