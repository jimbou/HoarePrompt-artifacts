Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers, `adj[a]` contains `b` `n - 1` times, `adj[b]` contains `a` `n - 1` times, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is `(L + R) // 2`, `R` is either 1 and 50001 or 50001 and 100001 depending on the values of `numCuts` and `leftover`, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `L` has been updated to be equal to `x`, which is the average of the original `L` and `R` values. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the exact value of `L` is now `(L + R) // 2`, which is a more specific expression than its original value.
