Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, adj is a list of n+1 empty lists, z is 0, stdin has no more lines of input**

The code reads a line from stdin, which contains two integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. This means that `n` and `k` now have the values read from stdin, and stdin has one less line of input. The second line creates a new list of lists, `adj`, with `n+1` empty lists. This new list is assigned to `adj`, replacing any previous value it may have had. The values of `t` and `z` are not affected by the code.
