Output State: **L is the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), R is the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts <= k and (numCuts is not equal to k or leftover < x), x is the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), numCuts is 0, leftover is the return value of dfs(1, 1), z is t, n is an integer, k is an integer, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, a is an integer, b is an integer, i is n - 1, and the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x) which is L is being printed**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times, with the only difference being that z is now equal to t, indicating that the loop has executed t times. The values of L, R, x, numCuts, leftover, n, k, adj, a, b, and i remain the same as in the output state after the loop executes 3 times.
