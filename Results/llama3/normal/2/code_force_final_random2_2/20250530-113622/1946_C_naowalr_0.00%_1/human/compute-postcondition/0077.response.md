Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is 0, a and b are integers, adj[a] contains b n - 1 times, adj[b] contains a n - 1 times, x is 50001, stdin contains no input. If numCuts is greater than k or (numCuts is equal to k and leftover is greater than or equal to 50001), then L is 50001 and R is 100001. Otherwise, L is 1 and R is 50001.***
