To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is at least 1, meaning `n` must be at least 2. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer, but we need to adjust it to be at least 2 for the loop to execute. `i` is not defined before the loop, but it will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **L is the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), R is the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts <= k and (numCuts is not equal to k or leftover < x), x is the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), numCuts is 0, leftover is the return value of dfs(1, 1), z is 1, n is an integer that must be at least 2, k is an integer, adj is a list of n + 1 empty lists, and the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x) which is L is being printed, i is 0**
