Postcondition: ***L and R are unchanged, x is the integer value of the average of L and R, numCuts is 0, leftover is the return value of dfs(1, 1). If numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), then L is the integer value of the average of the original L and R, R is unchanged, x is the integer value of the average of the original L and R. Otherwise, L is unchanged, R is the integer value of the average of L and the original R, x is the integer value of the average of L and the original R.***
