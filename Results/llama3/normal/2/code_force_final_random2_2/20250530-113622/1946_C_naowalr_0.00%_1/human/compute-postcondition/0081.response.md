Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers, `adj[a]` contains `b` `n - 1` times, `adj[b]` contains `a` `n - 1` times, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is either 1 or 50001, `R` is `(L + R) // 2`, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `adj[a]`, `adj[b]`, `x`, `numCuts`, `leftover`, and `L` remain unchanged. The value of `R` is updated to be the same as `x`, which is the average of the original `L` and `R` values. The stdin still contains no input.
