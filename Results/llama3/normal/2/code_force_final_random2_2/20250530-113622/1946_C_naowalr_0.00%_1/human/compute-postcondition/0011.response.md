To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition `R - L > 1`. This condition depends on the values of `R` and `L`.

Given the initial states:
- `t` is a positive integer greater than 0
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k < n`
- `adj` is a list of `n+1` lists where the list at index `a` contains `b` and the list at index `b` contains `a` for all pairs `(a, b)` read from stdin
- `z` is 0
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `a` is an integer
- `b` is an integer
- `a` and `b` are connected in `adj`
- `L` is 1
- `R` is 100001
- `numCuts` is 0

The loop condition `R - L > 1` is already satisfied with the given values of `L` and `R` because `100001 - 1 > 1`. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states of `L` and `R` for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k < n`, `adj` is a list of `n+1` lists where the list at index `a` contains `b` and the list at index `b` contains `a` for all pairs `(a, b)` read from stdin, `z` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `a` and `b` are connected in `adj`, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0**
