Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a for all pairs (a, b) read from stdin, z is 0, i is n - 1, a is an integer, b is an integer, a and b are connected in adj, numCuts is 0, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1), x is (L + R) // 2, L is 1 and R is 50001, or L is 50001 and R is 100001, R is (L + R) // 2**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of R has been updated to be equal to x, which is the average of L and R. This means that R is now equal to the midpoint of the range [L, R]. All other variables remain unchanged.
