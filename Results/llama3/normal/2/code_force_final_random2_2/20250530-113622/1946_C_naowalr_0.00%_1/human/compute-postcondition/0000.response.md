Output State: **`t` is a positive integer read from stdin, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` < `n`, `adj` is a list of lists of integers representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, and stdin has one less line of input.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated to a positive integer read from the first line of stdin. The values of `n`, `k`, and `adj` remain unchanged. The stdin now has one less line of input, as one line has been read to update the value of `t`.
