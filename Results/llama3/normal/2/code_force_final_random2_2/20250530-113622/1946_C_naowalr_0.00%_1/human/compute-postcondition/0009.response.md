Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a for all pairs (a, b) read from stdin, z is 0, i is n - 1, stdin has no more lines of input, a is an integer, b is an integer, a and b are connected in adj**.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is: the loop has finished executing, and the adjacency list `adj` has been populated with all the edges read from the input. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `z` remain unchanged, and `i` has reached its final value of `n - 1`. The input has been fully consumed, and the last pair of integers `a` and `b` read from the input are connected in the adjacency list.
