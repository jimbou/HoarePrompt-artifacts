To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute, because the loop iterates from `n - 1` down to 0.

Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 2.

Additionally, since `i` is the loop variable, we need to adjust its state to be the starting value of the loop, which is `n - 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n - 1**, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `L` is the minimum possible value of `x` such that `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), `R` is `L + 1`, `x` is the average of `L` and `R`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`, `z` is 2, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and the minimum possible value of `x` such that `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`) which is `L` is being printed.
