Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is 0, a and b are integers, adj[a] contains b n - 1 times, adj[b] contains a n - 1 times, L is 1, R is 100001, numCuts is 0, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is 0, a and b are integers, adj[a] contains b n - 1 times, adj[b] contains a n - 1 times, x is 50001, stdin contains no input. If numCuts is greater than k or (numCuts is equal to k and leftover is greater than or equal to 50001), then L is 50001 and R is 100001. Otherwise, L is 1 and R is 50001.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is 0, a and b are integers, adj[a] contains b n - 1 times, adj[b] contains a n - 1 times, x is (L + R) // 2, numCuts is 0, leftover is the return value of dfs(1, 1), stdin contains no input. If numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), then L is (L + R) // 2 and R is either 1 and 50001 or 50001 and 100001 depending on the values of numCuts and leftover. Otherwise, L is either 1 or 50001 and R is (L + R) // 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is 0, a and b are integers, adj[a] contains b n - 1 times, adj[b] contains a n - 1 times, x is (L + R) // 2, numCuts is 0, leftover is the return value of dfs(1, 1), stdin contains no input. If numCuts is greater than k or (numCuts equals k and leftover is greater than or equal to x), then L is set to (L + R) // 2. Otherwise, R is set to (L + R) // 2.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
