Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, k is an integer equal to the second input, adj is a list of n + 1 empty lists, L is the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), R is L + 1, x is the average of L and R, numCuts is 0, leftover is the return value of dfs(1, 1), z is 2, a is an integer, b is an integer, i is n - 1, and the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x) which is L is being printed**

The code first reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. Then, it creates a list of `n + 1` empty lists and assigns it to `adj`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
