To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `R - L > 1` and adjust the states of `R` and `L` accordingly.

Given the state right before the loop:

* `L` is 1
* `R` is 100001
* Other variables are not relevant to the loop condition

The loop condition `R - L > 1` is already satisfied with the current values of `L` and `R`, since `100001 - 1 = 100000`, which is indeed greater than 1.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states of `R` and `L` for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`, `z` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` contains `b` and the list at index `b` contains `a`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `i` is `n - 1`**
