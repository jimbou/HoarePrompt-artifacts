Output State: **L is the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), R is the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts <= k and (numCuts is not equal to k or leftover < x), x is the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), numCuts is 0, leftover is the return value of dfs(1, 1), z is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, a is an integer, b is an integer, i is n - 1, and the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x) which is L is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x) is still being printed, and the loop has iterated n-1 times, where n is an integer. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
