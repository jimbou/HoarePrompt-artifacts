Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is n - 1, a and b are integers, adj[a] contains b, adj[b] contains a, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code reads two integers from stdin, assigns them to `a` and `b`, and then appends `b` to the list `adj[a]` and `a` to the list `adj[b]`. As a result, `adj[a]` now contains `b` and `adj[b]` now contains `a`. The stdin is now empty as the two integers have been read.
