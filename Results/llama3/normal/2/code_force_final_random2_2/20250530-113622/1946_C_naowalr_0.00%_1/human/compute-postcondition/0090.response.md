The code prints the value of L which is the smallest value x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x).
Output: **L is the smallest value x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), R is the smallest value x such that numCuts <= k and (numCuts < k or leftover < x), n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is 0, a and b are integers, adj[a] contains b n - 1 times, adj[b] contains a n - 1 times, x is (L + R) // 2, numCuts is 0, leftover is the return value of dfs(1, 1), stdin contains no input, and L is printed**
