Output State: **L is 1, R is 100001, x is 50001, numCuts is 0, leftover is the return value of dfs(1, 1), z is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, a is an integer, b is an integer, i is n - 1**

The code block calculates the value of `x` as the average of `L` and `R`, which are 1 and 100001 respectively, resulting in `x` being 50001. The value of `numCuts` is reset to 0. The value of `leftover` is reassigned to the return value of the function `dfs(1, 1)`. The values of `L`, `R`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `adj`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged.
