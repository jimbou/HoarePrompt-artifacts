Output State: **L is either 1 or 50001, R is the average of L and either greater than 2 or greater than 50002, x is the average of L and either greater than 2 or greater than 50002, numCuts is 0, leftover is the return value of dfs(1, 1), z is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, a is an integer, b is an integer, i is n - 1**

In this output state, the value of R has been updated to be equal to x, which is the average of L and the original value of R. The original value of R was either greater than 2 or greater than 50002, so the new value of R is the average of L and one of these two values. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
