Output State: **L is unchanged, R is unchanged, x is the integer value of the average of L and R, numCuts is 0, leftover is the return value of dfs(1, 1)**

The first line assigns the integer value of the average of `L` and `R` to `x`. Since `L` and `R` are unchanged, `x` becomes the integer value of `(L + R) // 2`. The second line initializes `numCuts` to 0. The third line assigns the return value of `dfs(1, 1)` to `leftover`. The values of `L` and `R` are not affected by the code, and the loop condition `R - L > 1` remains valid.
