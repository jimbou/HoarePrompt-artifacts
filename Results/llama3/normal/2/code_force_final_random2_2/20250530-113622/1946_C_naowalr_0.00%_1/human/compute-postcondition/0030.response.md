Output: **L is the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), R is the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts <= k and (numCuts is not equal to k or leftover < x), x is the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), numCuts is 0, leftover is the return value of dfs(1, 1), and the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x) which is L is being printed**
