Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is 0, a and b are integers, adj[a] contains b n - 1 times, adj[b] contains a n - 1 times, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be 0, and the adjacency list `adj` will have `n-1` edges between nodes `a` and `b`. The input from `stdin` will be exhausted, and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will remain unchanged.
