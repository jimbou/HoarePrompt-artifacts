To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1):`. The variables involved are `i` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 2`, and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Since `i` is currently `n - 2`, we need to increment it by 1 to make it `n - 1`.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables `a`, `b`, `adj[a]`, `adj[b]`, and `stdin` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are integers, `adj[a]` contains `b` twice, `adj[b]` contains `a` twice, `stdin` contains no input.**
