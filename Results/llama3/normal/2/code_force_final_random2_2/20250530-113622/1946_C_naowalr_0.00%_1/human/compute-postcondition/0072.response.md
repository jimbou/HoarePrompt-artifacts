Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is 0, a and b are integers, adj[a] contains b n - 1 times, adj[b] contains a n - 1 times, L is 1, R is 100001, x is 50001, numCuts is 0, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1), stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `x` is calculated as the average of `L` and `R`, which are 1 and 100001 respectively. The value of `numCuts` is reset to 0. The `leftover` variable is assigned the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, but since the implementation of the `dfs` function is not provided, the exact value of `leftover` cannot be determined. All other variables remain unchanged.
