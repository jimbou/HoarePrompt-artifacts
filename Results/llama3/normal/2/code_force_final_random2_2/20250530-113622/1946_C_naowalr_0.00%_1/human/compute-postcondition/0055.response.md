Output State: **L is the average of the original L and R, R is either greater than 2 or greater than 50002, x is the average of the original L and R, numCuts is 0, leftover is the return value of dfs(1, 1), z is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, a is an integer, b is an integer, i is n - 1**

In this output state, the value of L has been updated to be the average of the original L and R, which means it can be either the average of 1 and a number greater than 2, or the average of 50001 and a number greater than 50002. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
