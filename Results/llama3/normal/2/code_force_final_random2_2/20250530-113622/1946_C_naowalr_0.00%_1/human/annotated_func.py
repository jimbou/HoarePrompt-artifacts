#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, adj is a list of lists of integers representing the adjacency list of a tree with n vertices, and the input is read from stdin.
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for z in range(t):
        n, k = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        
        adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
            adj[a].append(b)
            adj[b].append(a)
        
        L = 1
        
        R = int(100000.0 + 1)
        
        numCuts = 0
        
        while R - L > 1:
            x = (L + R) // 2
            numCuts = 0
            leftover = dfs(1, 1)
            if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
                L = x
            else:
                R = x
        
        print(L)
        
    #State: L is the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), R is the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts <= k and (numCuts is not equal to k or leftover < x), x is the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), numCuts is 0, leftover is the return value of dfs(1, 1), z is t, n is an integer, k is an integer, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, a is an integer, b is an integer, i is n - 1, and the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x) which is L is being printed

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, constructs an adjacency list of a tree with n vertices, and performs a binary search to find the minimum possible value of x such that the number of cuts in the tree is greater than k or the number of cuts is equal to k and the leftover value is greater than or equal to x. The function then prints this minimum value of x.
