Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is 0, a and b are integers, adj[a] contains b n - 1 times, adj[b] contains a n - 1 times, L is 1, R is 100001, numCuts is 0, stdin contains no input.**

The code initializes three new variables: L, R, and numCuts. L is assigned the value 1, R is assigned the value 100001 (which is the result of int(100000.0 + 1)), and numCuts is assigned the value 0. The values of n, i, a, b, adj[a], and adj[b] remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. Stdin still contains no input.
