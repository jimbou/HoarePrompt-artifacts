Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is a positive integer and must be at least 2, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, z is 0, i is 1, stdin has no more lines of input, a is an integer, b is an integer**

The code reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `a` and `b`. Since stdin has no more lines of input, it remains empty. The code then appends `b` to the list at index `a` in `adj` and appends `a` to the list at index `b` in `adj`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `z`, and `i` remain unchanged. The code introduces two new variables `a` and `b`, which are integers.
