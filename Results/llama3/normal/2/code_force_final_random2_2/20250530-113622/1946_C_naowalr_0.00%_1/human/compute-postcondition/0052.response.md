Postcondition: ***L is either 1 or 50001, R is either greater than 2 or greater than 50002, x is the average of L and R, numCuts is 0, leftover is the return value of dfs(1, 1), z is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, a is an integer, b is an integer, i is n - 1. If numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), then L is the average of the initial L and R. Otherwise, R is the average of L and either greater than 2 or greater than 50002.***
