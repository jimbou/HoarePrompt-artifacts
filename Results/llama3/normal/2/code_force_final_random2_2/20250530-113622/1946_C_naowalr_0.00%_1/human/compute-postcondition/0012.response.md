Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a for all pairs (a, b) read from stdin, z is 0, i is n - 1, a is an integer, b is an integer, a and b are connected in adj, L is 1, R is 100001, numCuts is 0, x is 50001, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1)**

The code assigns the value of `(L + R) // 2` to `x`, making `x` equal to 50001. It then resets `numCuts` to 0. The `dfs` function is called with arguments `1` and `1`, and its result is assigned to `leftover`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `adj`, `z`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged.
