Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: L is 1, R is 100001, numCuts is 0, leftover is the return value of dfs(1, 1), z is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, a is an integer, b is an integer, i is n - 1, and the minimum possible value of x such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x) which is L is being printed.
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *L is either 1 or 50001, R is either 100001 or 50001, x is 50001, numCuts is either greater than k or equals k with leftover greater than or equal to x, or numCuts is less than or equal to k with leftover less than 50001, leftover is the return value of dfs(1, 1), z is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, a is an integer, b is an integer, i is n - 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *L is either 1 or 50001, R is either greater than 2 or greater than 50002, x is the average of L and R, numCuts is 0, leftover is the return value of dfs(1, 1), z is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, a is an integer, b is an integer, i is n - 1. If numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), then L is the average of the initial L and R. Otherwise, R is the average of L and either greater than 2 or greater than 50002.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *L is either 1 or 50001, R is either greater than 2 or greater than 50002, x is the average of L and R, numCuts is 0, leftover is the return value of dfs(1, 1), z is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, a is an integer, b is an integer, i is n - 1. If numCuts is greater than k or if numCuts is equal to k and leftover is greater than or equal to x, then L remains the average of the original L and R. Otherwise, R is updated to be the average of L and either greater than 2 or greater than 50002.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
