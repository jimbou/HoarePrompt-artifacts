To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since `n - 1` needs to be at least 1 for the loop to run). 

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 2, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` < `n`, `adj` is a list of `n+1` empty lists, `z` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin has no more lines of input**
