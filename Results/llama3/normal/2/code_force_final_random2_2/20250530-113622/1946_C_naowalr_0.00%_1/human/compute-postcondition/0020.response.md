Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` < `n`, `adj` is a list of `n+1` lists where the list at index `a` contains `b` and the list at index `b` contains `a` for all pairs (`a`, `b`) read from stdin, `z` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `a` and `b` are connected in `adj`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `x` is (`L + R`) // 2, `L` is either 1 or 50001, `R` is either 50001 or 100001, and now `L` is equal to `x` which is (`L + R`) // 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: All variables keep their initial values except for `L`, which is now equal to the average of its initial value and `R`. The value of `L` is now the midpoint of its initial range.
