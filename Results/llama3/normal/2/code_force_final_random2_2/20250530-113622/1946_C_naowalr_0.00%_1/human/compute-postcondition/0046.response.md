Output State: **L is 1, R is 50001, x is 50001, numCuts is 0, leftover is the return value of dfs(1, 1), z is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, a is an integer, b is an integer, i is n - 1. Additionally, either numCuts is less than or equal to k and leftover is less than 50001.**

In this output state, the value of R has been updated to 50001, which is the value of x. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions that were true in the initial state, such as the relationship between numCuts, k, and leftover, are still valid.
