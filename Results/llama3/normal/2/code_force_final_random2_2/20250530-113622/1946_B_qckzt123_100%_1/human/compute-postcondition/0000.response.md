Output State: **T is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains T-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n, k <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^9 <= a_i <= 10^9). The sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. MOD is 1000000007.**

Explanation: The code reads the number of test cases from stdin and assigns it to the variable T. Since T is now an integer, stdin contains T-1 test cases. The rest of the information from the precondition remains valid, including the structure of each test case and the constraints on the values of n, k, and a_i. The value of MOD is also set to 1000000007, but it does not affect the state of the variables.
