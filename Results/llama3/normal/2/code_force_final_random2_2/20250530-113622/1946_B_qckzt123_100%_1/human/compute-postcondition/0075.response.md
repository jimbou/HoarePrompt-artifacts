Postcondition: ***T is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be at least 1, a is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, x is the third integer in the list a, s is the sum of the integers in a, if tmp is less than 0, t is the maximum of the previous value of t and 0, otherwise t is the maximum of the previous value of t and tmp, ans is the remainder of the sum of s, the new value of t multiplied by 2 to the power of k-1 and then taken modulo MOD, i is k-1, stdin contains T-6 test cases, and the value of ans is being printed.***
