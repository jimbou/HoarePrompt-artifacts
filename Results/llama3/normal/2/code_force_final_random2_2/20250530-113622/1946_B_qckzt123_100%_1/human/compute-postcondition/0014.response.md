To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements of list `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is the second integer in the list, and `a` has at least 2 integers.

For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 3 integers, and `x` should be the third integer in the list.

State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and the maximum of the first integer in `a` and 0, `x` is the third integer in the list, stdin contains T-2 test cases.**
