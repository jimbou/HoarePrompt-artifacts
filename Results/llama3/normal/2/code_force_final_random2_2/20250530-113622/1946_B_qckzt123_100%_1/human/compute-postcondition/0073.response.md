Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list `a`, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `t` is the maximum of the previous value of `t` and `tmp`, `tmp` is the sum of the first integer in the list `a` if it is non-negative and the second integer in the list `a` plus the third integer in the list `a`, `ans` is the remainder of the sum of `s`, the new value of `t` multiplied by 2 to the power of `k-1` and then taken modulo MOD, `i` is `k-1`, stdin contains `T-6` test cases, and the value of `ans` is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been updated to include the third integer in the list `a`, which is `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
