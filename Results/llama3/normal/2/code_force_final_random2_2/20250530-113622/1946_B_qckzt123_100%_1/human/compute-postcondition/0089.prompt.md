You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n, k <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^9 <= a_i <= 10^9). The sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
    MOD = 1000000007
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
        
        s = sum(a)
        
        t, tmp = 0, 0
        
        for x in a:
            tmp += x
            if tmp < 0:
                tmp = 0
            t = max(tmp, t)
        
        ans = ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD
        
        for i in range(k - 1):
            t *= 2
            t %= MOD
            ans += t
            ans %= MOD
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: T is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than or equal to 0, _ is T, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be at least 1, a is a list of integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum subarray sum of a multiplied by 2 to the power of k-1 and then taken modulo MOD, tmp is 0 if the maximum subarray sum of a is negative, otherwise tmp is the maximum subarray sum of a, ans is the remainder of the sum of s, t multiplied by 2 to the power of k-1 and then taken modulo MOD, i is k-1, and stdin contains 0 test cases, and the value of ans which is the remainder of the sum of s, t multiplied by 2 to the power of k-1 and then taken modulo MOD is being printed.

Return Postconditions: T is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than or equal to 0, _ is T, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be at least 1, a is a list of integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum subarray sum of a multiplied by 2 to the power of k-1 and then taken modulo MOD, tmp is 0 if the maximum subarray sum of a is negative, otherwise tmp is the maximum subarray sum of a, ans is the remainder of the sum of s, t multiplied by 2 to the power of k-1 and then taken modulo MOD, i is k-1, and stdin contains 0 test cases, and the value of ans which is the remainder of the sum of s, t multiplied by 2 to the power of k-1 and then taken modulo MOD is being printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
