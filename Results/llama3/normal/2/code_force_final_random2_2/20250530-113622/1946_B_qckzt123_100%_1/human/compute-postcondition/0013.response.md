Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and the maximum of the first integer in `a` and 0, `x` is the second integer in the list, stdin contains T-2 test cases. If the sum of the first integer in the list and the second integer in the list is negative, `tmp` is set to 0. Otherwise, `tmp` retains its original value.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated to be the maximum of `tmp` and the maximum of the first integer in `a` and 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `tmp` is still dependent on the sum of the first integer in the list and the second integer in the list. If the sum is negative, `tmp` is 0, otherwise it retains its original value.
