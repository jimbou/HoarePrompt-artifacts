Output State: **T is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be at least 3, a is a list of integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the value of t multiplied by 2 and then taken modulo MOD, ans is the remainder of the sum of the previous value of ans and the new value of t, taken modulo MOD, i is 2, stdin contains T-4 test cases, and the value of ans is being printed.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `t` and `ans`. The first line multiplies `t` by 2, and the second line takes the result modulo MOD. The third line adds the new value of `t` to `ans`, and the fourth line takes the result modulo MOD. The other variables remain unchanged.
