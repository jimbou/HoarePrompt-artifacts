The only variable in the loop head is variable  x and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 1 integer, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum of the first integer in a and 0, tmp is 0 if the first integer in the list is negative, otherwise tmp is the first integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the x is the second integer in the list.
State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `t` is the maximum of the first integer in `a` and 0, `tmp` is 0 if the first integer in the list is negative, otherwise `tmp` is the first integer in the list, stdin contains T-2 test cases, x is the second integer in the list**
