Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list `a`, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `t` is the maximum of the previous value of `t` and 0, `tmp` is 0, `ans` is the remainder of the sum of `s`, the new value of `t` multiplied by 2 to the power of `k-1` and then taken modulo MOD, `i` is `k-1`, stdin contains `T-6` test cases, and the value of `ans` is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been reset to 0, and the value of `t` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and 0, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The program is still in the process of printing the value of `ans`, and the stdin still contains `T-6` test cases.
