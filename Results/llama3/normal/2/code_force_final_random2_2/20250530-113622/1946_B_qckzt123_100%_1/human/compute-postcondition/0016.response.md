The code sets `tmp` to 0. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains T-2 test cases.

Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and the maximum of the first integer in `a` and 0, `x` is the third integer in the list, `tmp` is 0, stdin contains T-2 test cases.**
