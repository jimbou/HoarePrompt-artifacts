Output State: **T is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be at least 3, a is a list of integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum subarray sum of a multiplied by 2 to the power of k-1 and then taken modulo MOD, tmp is 0, ans is the remainder of the sum of s, t multiplied by 2 to the power of k-1 and then taken modulo MOD, i is 1, stdin contains T-4 test cases, and the value of ans is being printed, t is the value of t multiplied by 2 and then taken modulo MOD, ans is the remainder of the sum of the previous value of ans and the new value of t, taken modulo MOD.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated to be the result of multiplying the previous value of `t` by 2 and then taking the result modulo MOD. The value of `ans` has also been updated to be the remainder of the sum of the previous value of `ans` and the new value of `t`, taken modulo MOD. All other variables remain unchanged.
