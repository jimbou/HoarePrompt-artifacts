Output State: **T is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be at least 3, a is a list of integers, x is the last integer in the list a, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum subarray sum of a multiplied by 2 to the power of k, and then taken modulo MOD, tmp is 0 if the maximum subarray sum of a is negative, otherwise tmp is the maximum subarray sum of a, ans is the remainder of the sum of s, t multiplied by 2 to the power of k, and then taken modulo MOD, i is 1, and stdin contains T-6 test cases, t is now the maximum subarray sum of a multiplied by 2 to the power of k+1, and then taken modulo MOD, ans is now the remainder of the sum of s, t multiplied by 2 to the power of k+1, and then taken modulo MOD.**

In this output state, the values of T, _, n, k, a, x, s, tmp, and i remain unchanged. The value of t is updated to be the maximum subarray sum of a multiplied by 2 to the power of k+1, and then taken modulo MOD. The value of ans is also updated to be the remainder of the sum of s, t multiplied by 2 to the power of k+1, and then taken modulo MOD. The number of test cases in stdin remains T-6.
