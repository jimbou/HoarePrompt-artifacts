Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n, k <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^9 <= a_i <= 10^9). The sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
