Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is 0, tmp is 0, stdin contains T-2 test cases
Code of the loop:
for x in a:
    tmp += x
    if tmp < 0:
        tmp = 0
    t = max(tmp, t)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `t` is the maximum of the first integer in `a` and 0, `tmp` is 0 if the first integer in the list is negative, otherwise `tmp` is the first integer in the list, stdin contains T-2 test cases

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and the maximum of the first integer in `a` and 0, `x` is the second integer in the list, stdin contains T-2 test cases. If the sum of the first integer in the list and the second integer in the list is negative, `tmp` is set to 0. Otherwise, `tmp` retains its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and the maximum of the first integer in `a` and 0, `x` is the third integer in the list, `tmp` is either increased by `x` or set to 0 if it was negative, and stdin contains T-2 test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
