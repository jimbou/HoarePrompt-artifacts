Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and the maximum of the first integer in `a` and 0, `x` is the third integer in the list, `tmp` is increased by `x`, stdin contains T-2 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `tmp` is increased by the value of `x`, which is the third integer in the list `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases `T` is still greater than 0, and the stdin still contains T-2 test cases.
