Output State: **T is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be at least 1, a is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, x is the second integer in the list a, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum of the first integer in the list a if it is non-negative and the maximum subarray sum of a multiplied by 2 to the power of k-1 and then taken modulo MOD, tmp is 0, ans is the remainder of the sum of s, t multiplied by 2 to the power of k-1 and then taken modulo MOD, i is k-1, stdin contains T-6 test cases, and the value of ans is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of tmp has been reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged, including T, _, n, k, a, x, s, t, ans, i, and the contents of stdin. The value of ans is still being printed.
