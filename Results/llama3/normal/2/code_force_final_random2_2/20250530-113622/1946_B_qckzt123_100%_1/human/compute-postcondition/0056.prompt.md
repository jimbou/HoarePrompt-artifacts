Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `t` is the maximum subarray sum of `a` multiplied by 2 to the power of `k-1` and then taken modulo MOD, `tmp` is 0, `ans` is the remainder of the sum of `s`, `t` multiplied by 2 to the power of `k-1` and then taken modulo MOD, `i` is `k-1`, stdin contains `T-4` test cases, and the value of `ans` is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k - 1):
    t *= 2
    t %= MOD
    ans += t
    ans %= MOD


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be at least 2, a is a list of integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum subarray sum of a multiplied by 2 to the power of k-1 and then taken modulo MOD, tmp is 0, ans is the remainder of the sum of s, t multiplied by 2 to the power of k-1 and then taken modulo MOD, i is 0, stdin contains T-4 test cases, and the value of ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: T is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be at least 3, a is a list of integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum subarray sum of a multiplied by 2 to the power of k-1 and then taken modulo MOD, tmp is 0, ans is the remainder of the sum of s, t multiplied by 2 to the power of k-1 and then taken modulo MOD, i is 1, stdin contains T-4 test cases, and the value of ans is being printed, t is the value of t multiplied by 2 and then taken modulo MOD, ans is the remainder of the sum of the previous value of ans and the new value of t, taken modulo MOD.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: T is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be at least 3, a is a list of integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the value of t multiplied by 2 and then taken modulo MOD, ans is the remainder of the sum of the previous value of ans and the new value of t, taken modulo MOD, i is 2, stdin contains T-4 test cases, and the value of ans is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
