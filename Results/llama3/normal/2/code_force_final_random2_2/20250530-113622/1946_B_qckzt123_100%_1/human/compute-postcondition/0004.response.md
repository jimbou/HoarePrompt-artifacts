Output State: **T is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is 0, tmp is the first integer in the list, stdin contains T-2 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been updated to be the first integer in the list `a`, which is represented by the variable `x`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains T-2 test cases.
