This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function calculates the sum of the integers, the maximum subarray sum, and then combines these values using a specific formula involving modular arithmetic. The result is printed for each test case. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.
