Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum possible sum of an array after k operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. The program uses a greedy approach to find the maximum sum.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. Read the number of test cases (T) and iterate through each test case.
2. For each test case, read the length of the array (n) and the number of operations (k).
3. Read the array elements and calculate the sum of the array (s).
4. Initialize two variables, t and tmp, to 0. The variable t will store the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, and tmp will store the current sum of a contiguous subarray.
5. Iterate through the array elements, updating tmp by adding the current element. If tmp becomes negative, reset it to 0. Update t with the maximum of tmp and t.
6. Calculate the initial answer by adding the sum of the array (s) and the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray (t), taking the result modulo MOD (10^9 + 7).
7. For each remaining operation (k-1), multiply t by 2, take the result modulo MOD, and add it to the answer.
8. Print the final answer.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. The use of a greedy approach to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is optimal, as it ensures that the maximum sum is found in a single pass through the array.

Correctness: **True**
