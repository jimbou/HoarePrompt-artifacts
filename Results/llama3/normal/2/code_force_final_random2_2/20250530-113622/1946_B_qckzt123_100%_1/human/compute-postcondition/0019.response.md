Output State: **T is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum subarray sum of a, tmp is 0, stdin contains T-2 test cases.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` will hold the maximum subarray sum of the list `a`, and `tmp` will be reset to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
