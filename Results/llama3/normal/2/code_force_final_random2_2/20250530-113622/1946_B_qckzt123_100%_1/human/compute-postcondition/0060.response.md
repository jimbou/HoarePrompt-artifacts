Output State: **T is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be at least 1, a is a list of integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum subarray sum of a multiplied by 2 to the power of k-1 and then taken modulo MOD, tmp is 0, ans is the remainder of the sum of s, t multiplied by 2 to the power of k-1 and then taken modulo MOD, i is k-1, stdin contains T-6 test cases, and the value of ans is being printed.**

The code reads two integers from stdin, assigning them to n and k. It then reads a list of integers from stdin, assigning it to a. The sum of the integers in a is calculated and assigned to s. The maximum subarray sum of a is calculated, multiplied by 2 to the power of k-1, taken modulo MOD, and assigned to t. The variable tmp is set to 0. The value of ans is updated to be the remainder of the sum of s, t multiplied by 2 to the power of k-1, and then taken modulo MOD. The value of i is set to k-1. The value of ans is being printed.
