State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `t` is the maximum of the first integer in the list `a` or 0 and the maximum subarray sum of `a` multiplied by 2 to the power of `k-1` and then taken modulo MOD, `tmp` is either the first integer in the list `a` or 0, `ans` is the remainder of the sum of `s`, the maximum of the first integer in the list `a` or 0 or the maximum subarray sum of `a` multiplied by 2 to the power of `k-1` and then taken modulo MOD multiplied by 2 to the power of `k-1` and then taken modulo MOD, and the original value of `ans`, divided by MOD, plus MOD, then divided by MOD again, `i` is `k-1`, `stdin` contains `T-4` test cases, and the value of `ans` is being printed, `x` is the second integer in the list `a`**
