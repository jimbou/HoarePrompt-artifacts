Output State: **T is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is 0, tmp is 0, stdin contains T-2 test cases**

The code block reads two lines from stdin for each test case. The first line contains two integers, `n` and `k`, which are assigned to the variables `n` and `k`, respectively. The second line contains a list of integers, which are assigned to the variable `a`. The sum of the integers in `a` is calculated and assigned to the variable `s`. The variables `t` and `tmp` are initialized to 0. The value of `T` and `_` remains unchanged. After executing the code block, stdin contains `T-2` test cases.
