Postcondition: ***`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and the maximum of the first integer in `a` and 0, `x` is the third integer in the list, `tmp` is either increased by `x` or set to 0 if it was negative, and stdin contains T-2 test cases.***
