Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `t` is the maximum of the first integer in `a` and 0, `tmp` is the sum of the first integer in the list and the second integer in the list if the first integer in the list is non-negative, otherwise `tmp` is the second integer in the list, stdin contains T-2 test cases, x is the second integer in the list**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been updated to be the sum of the first integer in the list and the second integer in the list if the first integer in the list is non-negative, otherwise `tmp` is the second integer in the list. The values of the other variables remain the same.
