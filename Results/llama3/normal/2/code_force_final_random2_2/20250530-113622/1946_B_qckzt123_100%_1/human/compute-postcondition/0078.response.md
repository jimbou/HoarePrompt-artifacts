Output State: **T is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be at least 1, a is a list of integers, x is the last integer in the list a, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum subarray sum of a multiplied by 2 to the power of k-1 and then taken modulo MOD, tmp is 0 if the maximum subarray sum of a is negative, otherwise tmp is the maximum subarray sum of a, ans is the remainder of the sum of s, t multiplied by 2 to the power of k-1 and then taken modulo MOD, i is k-1, stdin contains T-6 test cases, and the value of ans is being printed.**

The value of ans has been updated to be the remainder of the sum of s and t, where t is multiplied by 2 to the power of k-1 and then taken modulo MOD. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of ans is now being printed.
