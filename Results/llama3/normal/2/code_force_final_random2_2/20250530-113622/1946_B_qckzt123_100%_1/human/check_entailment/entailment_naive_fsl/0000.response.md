Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when k is 0. In this case, the program should return the sum of the array modulo 10^9 + 7, but the program does not handle this case correctly. The program assumes that k is always greater than 0 and performs operations based on this assumption. When k is 0, the program will not perform any operations and will return an incorrect result.

For example, if the input is:

1 0
-4 -7

The program should return -11, but it will return an incorrect result because it does not handle the case when k is 0 correctly.
