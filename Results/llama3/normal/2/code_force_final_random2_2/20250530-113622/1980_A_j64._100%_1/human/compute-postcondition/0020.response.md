Output State: **The program returns the sum of `m - count[j]` for all `j` such that `count[j]` is less than `m`, where `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, and `count[j]` is the frequency of character `chr(ord('A') + j)` in string `a`, and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', and `n` is an integer between 1 and 50.**
