Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `count` is a list of 7 integers where the integer at index `ord(char) - ord('A')` is the frequency of character `char` in string `a`, `char` is the last character in the string `a`. `i` is 2. If the frequency of 'A' is less than `m`, `needed_problems` is set to `m - count[0]`. Otherwise, if the frequency of the character at index `ord(char) - ord('A')` is less than `m`, `needed_problems` is set to `m - count[ord(char) - ord('A')]`. If the frequency of the character at index `i` is less than `m`, `needed_problems` is set to `m - count[0] + m - count[2]` if the frequency of 'A' is less than `m`, otherwise `needed_problems` is set to `m - count[ord(char) - ord('A')] + m - count[2]`. Otherwise, `needed_problems` is set to `m - count[2]`.***
