Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `count` is a list of 7 integers where the integer at index `ord(char) - ord('A')` is the frequency of character `char` in string `a`, `char` is the last character in the string `a`, `needed_problems` is 0, `i` is 0. The current value of `count[i]` is less than `m`***
