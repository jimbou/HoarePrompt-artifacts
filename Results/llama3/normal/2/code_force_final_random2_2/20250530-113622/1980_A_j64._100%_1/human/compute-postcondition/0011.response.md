Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `count` is a list of 7 integers where the integer at index `ord(char) - ord('A')` is the frequency of character `char` in string `a`, `char` is the last character in the string `a`, `needed_problems` is `m - count[i]`, `i` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `needed_problems` has been updated to be `m - count[i]`, where `count[i]` is the current value of the count of the character at index `i` in the string `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
