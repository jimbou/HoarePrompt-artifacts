Output State: **n is an integer between k and 2 * 10^5, k is an even integer greater than 0, permutation is a list of n integers where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is curr_v + 1, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i + k] is curr_v + 1, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is n // k + 4, multiples_of_k_plus_i is 1 + 3k, i is 1, stdin is empty, n must be greater than 1 + 2k**

Explanation:
The code modifies the permutation list by assigning the value of curr_v to the index multiples_of_k_plus_i. Since curr_v is n // k + 3, this value is assigned to permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]. The second line increments curr_v by 1, making it n // k + 4. The third line increments multiples_of_k_plus_i by k, making it 1 + 3k. The value of permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i + k] is also updated to curr_v + 1, which is n // k + 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
