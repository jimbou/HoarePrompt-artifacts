To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`.

Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2 and `len(permutation)` is `n`, the condition simplifies to `2 < n`.

Since `n` is already an integer between `k` and 2 * 10^5, and `k` is an even integer greater than 2, we can conclude that `n` is at least 4 (since `k` is at least 4).

Therefore, the condition `2 < n` is already satisfied, and no adjustments are needed to the program state.

State: **`n` is an integer between `k` and 2 * 10^5, `k` is an even integer greater than 2, `permutation` is a list of `n` integers where `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `n // k + 1 + (multiples_of_k_plus_i - 1) // k`, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `n // k + 1 + (n - 1 - k) // k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2, `i` is 2, stdin is empty, `n` is greater than 1 + (n - 1 - k) // k * k**
