Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a k-level permutation of length n. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases (t) and then iterates through each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads two integers n and k, where k is even and k â‰¤ n.

3. It initializes an array permutation of size n with all elements as 0.

4. It then iterates through each index i from 0 to k-1. For each i, it calculates the multiples of k plus i and assigns the current value curr_v to the permutation array at those indices. The curr_v is incremented by 1 after each assignment.

5. After filling the permutation array, it converts the array into a string with spaces in between and prints the result.

The program's logic is correct because it ensures that the permutation array is filled in such a way that the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1. This is achieved by distributing the numbers from 1 to n in a way that the numbers at indices that are multiples of k plus i (for i from 0 to k-1) are assigned in an increasing order.

However, there is a small issue in the program. The variable idx is declared but not used anywhere in the program. Although this does not affect the correctness of the program, it is considered good practice to remove unused variables to avoid confusion.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
