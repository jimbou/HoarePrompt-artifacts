Output State: **n is an integer between k and 2 * 10^5, k is an even integer greater than 2, permutation is a list of n integers where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is n // k + 1 + (multiples_of_k_plus_i - 1) // k, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is n // k + 1 + (n - 1 - k) // k + (n - 2) // k, multiples_of_k_plus_i is n, i is 2, stdin is empty, n is greater than 1 + (n - 1 - k) // k * k**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the loop has finished executing, and the variables in the loop head and body have reached their final values. The loop has iterated over the entire list `permutation`, assigning values to each element based on the formula `n // k + 1 + (multiples_of_k_plus_i - 1) // k`. The variable `curr_v` has been incremented by the number of iterations, which is `(n - 2) // k`. The variable `multiples_of_k_plus_i` has reached the end of the list, which is `n`. The other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
