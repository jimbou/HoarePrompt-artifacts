Output State: **n is an integer between k and 2 * 10^5, k is an even integer greater than 0, permutation is a list of n integers where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is n // k + 1 + (multiples_of_k_plus_i - 1) // k, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is n // k + 1 + (n - 1 - k) // k + (n - 2) // k + ... + (n - (k - 1)) // k, multiples_of_k_plus_i is n, i is k - 1, stdin is empty, n is greater than 1 + (n - 1 - k) // k * k + (n - 2) // k * k + ... + (n - (k - 1)) // k * k.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the permutation list is filled with values that are multiples of k plus the current value of curr_v. The value of curr_v is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and the multiples_of_k_plus_i variable is used to keep track of the current multiple of k being processed. The loop iterates k times, and after each iteration, the value of i is incremented by 1. The final state of the loop is a state where the permutation list is fully filled with values, and the value of curr_v is the maximum value that was assigned to any element in the permutation list.
