The variable in the loop head is multiples_of_k_plus_i and len(permutation). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable multiples_of_k_plus_i and len(permutation). If multiples_of_k_plus_i is less than len(permutation), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, multiples_of_k_plus_i is 1 + k, len(permutation) is n. n is an integer between k and 2 * 10^5, k is an even integer greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, n must be greater than 1 + k.

State: **n is an integer between k and 2 * 10^5, k is an even integer greater than 0, permutation is a list of n integers where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is curr_v + 1, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is n // k + 2, multiples_of_k_plus_i is 1 + k, i is 1, stdin is empty, n must be greater than 1 + k**
