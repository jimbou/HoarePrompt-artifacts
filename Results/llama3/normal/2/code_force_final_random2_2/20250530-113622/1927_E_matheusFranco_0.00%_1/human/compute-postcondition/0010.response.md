To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved. The loop head is `for i in range(k):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `n` is an integer between `k` and `2 * 10^5`
* `k` is an even integer greater than 0
* `permutation` is a list of `n` integers where `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v`
* `idx` is 0
* `idx_v` is 1
* `curr_v` is `n // k + 1`
* `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `n`
* `i` is 0
* `stdin` is empty

Since the loop head only involves the variable `i` and `k`, we can only adjust these two variables.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k`. Since `i` is currently 0, we can increment it by 1 to make it 1. The value of `k` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer between `k` and `2 * 10^5`, `k` is an even integer greater than 0, `permutation` is a list of `n` integers where `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v`, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `n // k + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `n`, `i` is 1, `stdin` is empty**
