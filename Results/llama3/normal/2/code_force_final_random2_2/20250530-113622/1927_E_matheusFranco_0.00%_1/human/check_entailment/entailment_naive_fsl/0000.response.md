Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program is correct because it follows the problem description and constructs a k-level permutation of length n. The function `func_1` takes two integers n and k as input and constructs a permutation array of length n. It then fills the permutation array in a way that ensures the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

The program uses a clever approach to construct the permutation. It starts by initializing an array of length n with zeros. Then, it iterates over the range of k and for each i, it fills the permutation array with values starting from 1 and incrementing by 1, but with a twist. It fills the values at indices that are multiples of k plus i. This ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length k will have a difference of no more than 1.

The program also handles the case where k is even, as required by the problem description. The function `func_2` simply reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly constructs a k-level permutation for all possible inputs, and the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
