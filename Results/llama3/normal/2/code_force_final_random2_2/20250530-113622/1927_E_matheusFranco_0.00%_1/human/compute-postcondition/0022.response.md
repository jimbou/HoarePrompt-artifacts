Output State: **n is an integer between k and 2 * 10^5, k is an even integer greater than 2, permutation is a list of n integers where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is n // k + 1 + (multiples_of_k_plus_i - 1) // k, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is n // k + 1 + (n - 1 - k) // k + 1, multiples_of_k_plus_i is 2 + k, i is 2, stdin is empty, n is greater than 1 + (n - 1 - k) // k * k**

In this output state, the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` has been updated to `curr_v`, which is `n // k + 1 + (n - 1 - k) // k`. The value of `curr_v` has been incremented by 1, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` has been incremented by `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
