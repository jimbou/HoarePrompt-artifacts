Output State: **n is an integer between k and 2 * 10^5, k is an even integer greater than 2, permutation is a list of n integers where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is n // k + 1 + (multiples_of_k_plus_i - 1) // k, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is n // k + 1 + (n - 1 - k) // k + 3, multiples_of_k_plus_i is 2 + 3k, i is 2, stdin is empty, n is greater than 6, and the length of permutation is greater than 2 + 2k**

The code modifies the permutation list by assigning the value of curr_v to the index multiples_of_k_plus_i. The value of curr_v is then incremented by 1. The value of multiples_of_k_plus_i is also incremented by k. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
