Output: **`n` is an integer between `k` and 2 * 10^5, `k` is an even integer greater than 0, `permutation` is a list of `n` integers where `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `n // k + 1 + (multiples_of_k_plus_i - 1) // k`, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `n // k + 1 + (n - 1 - k) // k + (n - 2) // k + ... + (n - (k - 1)) // k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `n`, `i` is `k - 1`, and `result` is a string of space-separated integers representing the permutation, and `n` is greater than `1 + (n - 1 - k) // k * k + (n - 2) // k * k + ... + (n - (k - 1)) // k * k`, and the string of space-separated integers representing the permutation is being printed**
