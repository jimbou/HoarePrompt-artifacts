Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains no input**

The first line, `func_1()`, does not affect any variables in the initial state, as it is a function call with no apparent side effects on the variables `t` and `stdin`. The second line, `t -= 1`, decrements the value of `t` by 1. Since `t` was initially an integer greater than 0, after the decrement, `t` becomes an integer greater than or equal to 0. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, as it still contains no input.
