Output State: **n is an integer between k and 2 * 10^5, k is an even integer greater than 0, permutation is a list of n integers where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is curr_v, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is n // k + 1, multiples_of_k_plus_i is n, i is 0, stdin is empty**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the permutation list is filled with values from 1 to n // k + 1, and the multiples_of_k_plus_i variable has reached the length of the permutation list. The other variables remain unchanged.
