Output State: **`n` is an integer between `k` and `2 * 10^5`, `k` is an even integer greater than 0, `permutation` is a list of `n` integers where `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v`, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `n // k + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1, `i` is 1, `stdin` is empty**

The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is updated to `i`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
