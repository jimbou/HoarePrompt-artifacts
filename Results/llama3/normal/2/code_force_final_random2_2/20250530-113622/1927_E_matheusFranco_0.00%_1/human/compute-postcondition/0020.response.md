Output State: **`n` is an integer between `k` and 2 * 10^5, `k` is an even integer greater than 2, `permutation` is a list of `n` integers where `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `n // k + 1 + (multiples_of_k_plus_i - 1) // k`, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `n // k + 1 + (n - 1 - k) // k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2, `i` is 2, stdin is empty, `n` is greater than 1 + (n - 1 - k) // k * k.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` has been updated to 2, while the values of the other variables remain the same. The list `permutation` still has the same structure, with its elements determined by the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i`. The input stream `stdin` is still empty. The conditions on `n` and `k` are still satisfied.
