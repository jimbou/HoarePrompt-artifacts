Output State: **n is an integer between k and 2 * 10^5, k is an even integer greater than 0, permutation is a list of n integers where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is curr_v + 1, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is n // k + 2, multiples_of_k_plus_i is 1 + k, i is 1, stdin is empty**

Explanation:

The first line assigns the value of `curr_v` to `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]`. Since `curr_v` is `n // k + 1`, this means that `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` becomes `n // k + 1`.

The second line increments `curr_v` by 1, making it `n // k + 2`.

The third line increments `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k`, making it `1 + k`.

No other variables are affected by the code. The values of `n`, `k`, `idx`, `idx_v`, `i`, and `stdin` remain the same as in the initial state.
