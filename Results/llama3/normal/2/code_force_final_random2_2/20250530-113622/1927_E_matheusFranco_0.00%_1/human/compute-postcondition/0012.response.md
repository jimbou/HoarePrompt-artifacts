To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the loop condition: `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`. This condition depends on the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` and the length of `permutation`.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `n` is an integer between `k` and `2 * 10^5`
- `k` is an even integer greater than 0
- `permutation` is a list of `n` integers
- `idx` is 0
- `idx_v` is 1
- `curr_v` is `n // k + 1`
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1
- `i` is 1
- `stdin` is empty

The only variables in the loop head are `multiples_of_k_plus_i` and `permutation`. To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to guarantee that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of `permutation`.

Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1 and the length of `permutation` is `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1. Given that `n` is already defined as an integer between `k` and `2 * 10^5`, and `k` is an even integer greater than 0, the minimum value of `n` can be 2 (since `k` can be 2, and `n` can be equal to `k`). Therefore, no additional constraints need to be added to the state of `n` or `k` to ensure the loop can execute.

However, to explicitly state the condition that allows the loop to execute, we acknowledge that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `n`, which is inherently satisfied by the given conditions since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2.

State: **`n` is an integer between `k` and `2 * 10^5`, `k` is an even integer greater than 0, `permutation` is a list of `n` integers where `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v`, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `n // k + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1, `i` is 1, `stdin` is empty**

Note that the state remains largely unchanged because the conditions provided already ensure that the loop can execute at least once. The critical aspect is recognizing that `n` being at least 2 (due to `k` being at least 2 and `n` being between `k` and `2 * 10^5`) inherently satisfies the loop condition for the first iteration.
