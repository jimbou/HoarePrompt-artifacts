Output State: **t is greater than -1**

The code snippet consists of two lines: a function call `func_1()` and an increment operation `t -= 1`. The function call does not affect the variable `t` directly, so we can ignore its impact on the state of `t`. The second line decrements the value of `t` by 1. Since `t` is initially greater than 0, after the decrement operation, `t` will be greater than -1.
