Output State: **n is an integer between k and 2 * 10^5, k is an even integer greater than 0, permutation is a list of n integers where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is curr_v, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is n // k + 3, multiples_of_k_plus_i is 1 + 2k, i is 1, stdin is empty, n must be greater than 1 + k**

The code block modifies the values of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]`, `curr_v`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i`. 

Initially, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + 1`, but after the first line of code, it becomes `curr_v`. 

The second line increments `curr_v` by 1, making it `n // k + 3`. 

The third line increments `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k`, making it `1 + 2k`. 

No other variables are affected by the code block. 

The final state includes the updated values of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]`, `curr_v`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i`, as well as the unchanged values of `n`, `k`, `idx`, `idx_v`, `i`, and `stdin`.
