Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even and 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5. A permutation is k-level if the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of continuous segments of length k is at most 1.

Function 1 generates a permutation by assigning values to multiples of k plus i, where i ranges from 0 to k-1. The function takes two space-separated integers n and k as input from stdin and prints the resulting permutation as a string.

Function 2 reads an integer from standard input and executes Function 1 that many times.

The given program is correct because it meets the problem description. Function 1 correctly generates a k-level permutation by assigning values to multiples of k plus i, and Function 2 correctly executes Function 1 the specified number of times.

Correctness: **True**
