Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even. A permutation is k-level if the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

Function `func_1()` generates a permutation of integers from 1 to n, where n is an input integer, and prints the permutation as a string of space-separated integers. The permutation is constructed by assigning values to multiples of k plus i, where k is an even input integer and i ranges from 0 to k-1.

Function `func_2()` reads an integer from standard input and executes `func_1()` that many times, until the input integer reaches 0 or less.

The key insight is that the permutation generated by `func_1()` meets the k-level condition. By assigning values to multiples of k plus i, the function ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length k are evenly distributed, differing by no more than 1.

The execution summaries of the functions confirm that `func_1()` generates a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and `func_2()` executes `func_1()` the specified number of times. Since `func_1()` generates a k-level permutation, and `func_2()` executes `func_1()` correctly, the overall program is correct.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
