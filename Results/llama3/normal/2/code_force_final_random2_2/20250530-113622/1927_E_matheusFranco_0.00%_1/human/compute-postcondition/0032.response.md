Functionality: **The function generates a permutation of integers from 1 to n, where n is an input integer, and prints the permutation as a string of space-separated integers. The permutation is constructed by assigning values to multiples of k plus i, where k is an even input integer and i ranges from 0 to k-1. The function takes two space-separated integers n and k as input from stdin, where k is even and 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The function does not return any value, but prints the resulting permutation as a string.**
