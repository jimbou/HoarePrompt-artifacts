Output State: **n is an integer between k and 2 * 10^5, k is an even integer greater than 0, permutation is a list of n integers where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is n // k + 1 + (multiples_of_k_plus_i - 1) // k, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is n // k + 1 + (n - 1 - k) // k, multiples_of_k_plus_i is n, i is 1, stdin is empty, n must be greater than 1 + (n - 1 - k) // k * k.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the permutation list has been modified such that each element at index multiples_of_k_plus_i has been assigned a value equal to n // k + 1 plus the number of times k fits into multiples_of_k_plus_i minus 1. The variable curr_v has been incremented by the number of times the loop executed, which is equal to the number of times k fits into n minus 1. The variable multiples_of_k_plus_i has reached the end of the permutation list, which is equal to n. The other variables remain unchanged.
