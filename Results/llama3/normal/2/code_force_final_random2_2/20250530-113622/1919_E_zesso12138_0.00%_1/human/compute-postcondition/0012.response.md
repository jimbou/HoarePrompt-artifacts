Based on the initial state, we can determine the output of the print statement as follows:

* `n` is an integer equal to the value at `data[index]`.
* `index` is equal to its original value plus the sum of all values of `n` plus `t`.
* `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data`.
* `results` is a list containing at least 2 elements which are the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all values of `n` and `p`.
* `_` is `t-1`.
* `t` is at least 1.
* `res` is the second element in `results`.

The print statement simply prints the value of `res`, which is the second element in the `results` list.

Since the exact values of `data`, `index`, `n`, `p`, and `func_1` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the second result of the `func_1` function for all values of `n` and `p`.

Output: **the second result of func_1(n, p) for all values of n and p**
