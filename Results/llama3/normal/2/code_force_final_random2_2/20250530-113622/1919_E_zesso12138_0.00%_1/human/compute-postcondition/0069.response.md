Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of integers, `MOD` is a constant integer, `dp` is a list of integers of length 2n + 1, `offset` is an integer equal to `n`, `new_dp` is a list of integers of length 2n + 1 where `new_dp[3]` is equal to `dp[2]` modulo `MOD`, the values in `p` are sorted in non-decreasing order and the absolute value of each element in `p` is less than or equal to `n`, `dp` has all elements equal to 0 except `dp[n]` which is equal to 1, `i` is 2, `2 * n + 1` is at least 2, `j` is 2.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `p`, `MOD`, `offset`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The list `dp` also remains unchanged. The list `new_dp` has been updated such that its third element (`new_dp[3]`) is now equal to the second element of `dp` (`dp[2]`) modulo `MOD`. The other elements of `new_dp` remain unchanged. The properties of `p` and `dp` also remain unchanged.
