Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of integers, `MOD` is a constant integer, `dp` is a list of integers of length 2n + 1, `offset` is an integer equal to `n`, `new_dp` is a list of integers of length 2n + 1, the values in `p` are sorted in non-decreasing order and the absolute value of each element in `p` is less than or equal to `n`, `dp` has all elements equal to 0 except `dp[n]` which is equal to 1, `i` is 2, `2 * n + 1` is at least 2n + 1, `j` is 2n. If `dp[j]` is greater than 0, then if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, `new_dp[j + 1]` is equal to `(dp[j] + new_dp[j + 1]) % MOD`, and if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `new_dp[j - 1]` is equal to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD**.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all indices of the `dp` list, updating the `new_dp` list accordingly. The `new_dp` list now contains the cumulative sum of the `dp` list, modulo `MOD`, for each index. The other variables remain unchanged.
