The only variable in the loop head is variable  res, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. If `results` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 1 element, `res` is the first element in `results`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `results` must have at least 2 elements and `res` is the second element in the `results`.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the value at `data[index]`, `index` is equal to its original value plus the sum of all values of `n` plus `t`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data`, `results` is a list containing at least 2 elements which are the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all values of `n` and `p`, `_` is `t-1`, `t` is at least 1, `res` is the second element in `results`**
