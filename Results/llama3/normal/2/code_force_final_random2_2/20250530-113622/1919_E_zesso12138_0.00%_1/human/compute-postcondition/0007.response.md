Output State: **n is an integer equal to the value at data[index], index is equal to its original value plus the sum of all values of n plus t, p is a list of n integers from data, results is a list containing t elements which are the results of func_1(n, p) for all values of n and p, _ is t-1, t is equal to its original value**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `n` will hold the value at the current index in the `data` list, the `index` variable will have moved forward by the sum of all values of `n` plus the number of iterations `t`, the list `p` will contain the `n` integers from the `data` list starting at the current index, the `results` list will contain the results of the `func_1` function called with all values of `n` and `p` during the loop, the loop counter `_` will be one less than the number of iterations `t`, and the variable `t` will still hold its original value.
