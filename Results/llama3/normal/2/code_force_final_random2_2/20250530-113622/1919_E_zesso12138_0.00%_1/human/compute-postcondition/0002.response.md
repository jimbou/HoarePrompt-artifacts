Output State: **n is an integer equal to the value at data[index], index is equal to its original value plus n plus 1, p is a list of n integers from data, results is a list containing one element which is the result of func_1(n, p), _ is 0**

In this output state, the value of `n` is updated to the integer value at `data[index]`. The value of `index` is incremented by `n + 1` due to the two increment operations. The list `p` is updated to contain `n` integers from `data` starting from the original `index + 1`. The list `results` now contains one element, which is the result of the function `func_1` called with the updated `n` and `p`. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0.
