Functionality: **Reads input data from standard input, processes it in batches, and prints the results. The function accepts no parameters and returns no value. It reads a sequence of integers from standard input, where the first integer `t` represents the number of batches, and each batch consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers `p`. The function processes each batch by calling another function `func_1` with `n` and `p` as arguments, stores the results in a list, and finally prints all the results.**
