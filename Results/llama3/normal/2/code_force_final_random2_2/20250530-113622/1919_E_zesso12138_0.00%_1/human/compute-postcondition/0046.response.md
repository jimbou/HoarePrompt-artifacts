Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of integers, `MOD` is a constant integer, `dp` is a list of integers of length 2n + 1, `offset` is an integer equal to `n`, `new_dp` is a list of integers of length 2n + 1, the values in `p` are sorted in non-decreasing order and the absolute value of each element in `p` is less than or equal to `n`, `dp` has all elements equal to 0 except `dp[n]` which is equal to 1, `i` is 1, `2 * n + 1` is at least 4, `new_dp[j - 1]` is equal to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` and if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, then `new_dp[3]` is equal to `dp[2]` modulo `MOD`.**

The code updates the value of `new_dp[j - 1]` by adding `dp[j]` to it and taking the result modulo `MOD`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The precondition that `2 * n + 1` is at least 4 is still valid after the code has been executed.
