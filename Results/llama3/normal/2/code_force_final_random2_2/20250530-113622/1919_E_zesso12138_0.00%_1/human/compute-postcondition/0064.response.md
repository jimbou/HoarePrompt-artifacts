Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of integers, `MOD` is a constant integer, `dp` is a list of integers of length 2n + 1, `offset` is an integer equal to `n`, `new_dp` is a list of integers of length 2n + 1, the values in `p` are sorted in non-decreasing order and the absolute value of each element in `p` is less than or equal to `n`, `dp` has all elements equal to 0 except `dp[n]` which is equal to 1, `i` is 2, `2 * n + 1` is at least 1, `j` is 1. If `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, then `new_dp[2]` is updated to `(dp[1] + new_dp[2]) % MOD` and the rest of the elements in `new_dp` remain the same. Otherwise, no changes are made to `new_dp`.***
