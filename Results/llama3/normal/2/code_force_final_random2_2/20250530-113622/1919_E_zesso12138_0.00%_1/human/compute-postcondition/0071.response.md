Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of integers, `MOD` is a constant integer, `dp` is a list of integers of length 2n + 1, `offset` is an integer equal to `n`, `new_dp` is a list of integers of length 2n + 1, the values in `p` are sorted in non-decreasing order and the absolute value of each element in `p` is less than or equal to `n`, `dp` has all elements equal to 0 except `dp[n]` which is equal to 1, `i` is 2, `2 * n + 1` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `new_dp[1]` is equal to `dp[2]` modulo `MOD`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `new_dp` at index `j - 1` (which is 1) is updated to be the sum of its previous value and `dp[j]` (which is `dp[2]`) modulo `MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged.
