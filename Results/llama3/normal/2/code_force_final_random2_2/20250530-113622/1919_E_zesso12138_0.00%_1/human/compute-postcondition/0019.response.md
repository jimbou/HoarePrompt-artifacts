Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers, `MOD` is a constant integer, `dp` is a list of integers of length 2n + 1, `offset` is an integer equal to `n`, `new_dp` is a list of integers of length 2n + 1 where `new_dp[4]` is equal to `(dp[3] + new_dp[4]) % MOD` and all other elements are equal to 0, the values in `p` are sorted in non-decreasing order and the absolute value of each element in `p` is less than or equal to `n`, `dp` has all elements equal to 0 except `dp[n]` which is equal to 1, `j` is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `new_dp[4]` has been updated to `(dp[3] + new_dp[4]) % MOD`, where `dp[3]` is 0 and `new_dp[4]` was initially 0, so `new_dp[4]` is now equal to `(0 + 0) % MOD` which is 0. All other elements of `new_dp` remain 0. The values of the other variables are not affected.
