To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.

To adjust the states, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of integers, `MOD` is a constant integer, `dp` is a list of integers of length 2n + 1, `offset` is an integer equal to `n`, `new_dp` is a list of integers of length 2n + 1, the values in `p` are sorted in non-decreasing order and the absolute value of each element in `p` is less than or equal to `n`, `dp` has all elements equal to 0 except `dp[n]` which is equal to 1, `i` is 2, `2 * n + 1` is at least 2n + 1. If `dp[j]` is greater than 0, then if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, `dp[j + 1]` is equal to `dp[j]` modulo `MOD`, and if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[j - 1]` is equal to `(dp[j - 1] + dp[j])` modulo `MOD`.**
