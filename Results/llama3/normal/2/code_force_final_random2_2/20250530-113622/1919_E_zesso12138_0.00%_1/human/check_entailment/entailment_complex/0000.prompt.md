Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There is a hidden array a of size n consisting of only 1 and -1 . Let p be the
prefix sums of array a . More formally, p is an array of length n defined as
p_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_i . Afterwards, array p is sorted in non-
decreasing order. For example, if a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] , then p = [1, 0, -1,
0, 1] before sorting and p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] after sorting.

You are given the prefix sum array p after sorting, but you do not know what
array a is. Your task is to count the number of initial arrays a such that the
above process results in the given sorted prefix sum array p . As this number
can be large, you are only required to find it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the size of the hidden array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n
(|p_i| \le n ) — the n prefix sums of a sorted in non-decreasing order.

It is guaranteed that p_1 \le p_2 \le \ldots \le p_n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000 .

Output

For each test case, output the answer modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

In the first two test cases, the only possible arrays a for n = 1 are a = [1]
and a = [-1] . Their respective sorted prefix sum arrays p are p = [1] and p =
[-1] . Hence, there is no array a that can result in the sorted prefix sum
array p = [0] and there is exactly 1 array a that can result in the sorted
prefix sum array p = [1] .

In the third test case, it can be proven that there is no array a that could
result in the sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 1, 2] .

In the fourth test case, the 3 possible arrays a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] are:

  * a = [1, -1, 1, -1, -1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, 1, 0, -1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, -1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [-1, 0, 1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 

For the fifth test case, the only possible array a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1] is a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1] .

If `dp[j]` is greater than 0, then if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, `dp[j + 1]` is equal to `(dp[j] + dp[j + 1]) % MOD`, and if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[j - 1]` is equal to `(dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]
    #The program returns the value of dp at index final_sum, where final_sum is equal to p[-1] + n, p[-1] is the last element in the sorted list p, and n is a positive integer. The value of dp at index final_sum is calculated based on the previous values of dp, which are updated according to the conditions: if dp[j] is greater than 0, then dp[j + 1] is equal to (dp[j] + dp[j + 1]) % MOD if j + 1 is less than or equal to 2 * n, and dp[j - 1] is equal to (dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD if j is greater than or equal to 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the value of a dynamic programming array `dp` at a specific index `final_sum`, which is determined by the last element of a sorted list `p` and a positive integer `n`. The function iterates `n` times, updating the `dp` array based on the previous values and a modulo operation with a constant integer `MOD`. The final result is the value of `dp` at the index `final_sum`, which is calculated based on the cumulative sum of the previous values in the `dp` array.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and p is a list of integers such that -n <= p_i <= n for all i and p is sorted in non-decreasing order.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads input data from standard input, processes it in batches, and prints the results. The function accepts no parameters and returns no value. It reads a sequence of integers from standard input, where the first integer `t` represents the number of batches, and each batch consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers `p`. The function processes each batch by calling another function `func_1` with `n` and `p` as arguments, stores the results in a list, and finally prints all the results.
