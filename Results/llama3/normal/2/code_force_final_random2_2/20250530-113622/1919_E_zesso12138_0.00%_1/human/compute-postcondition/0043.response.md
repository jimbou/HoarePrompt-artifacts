The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `2 * n + 1` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1 so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `2 * n + 1` must be at least 3.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of integers, `MOD` is a constant integer, `dp` is a list of integers of length 2n + 1, `offset` is an integer equal to `n`, `new_dp` is a list of integers of length 2n + 1, the values in `p` are sorted in non-decreasing order and the absolute value of each element in `p` is less than or equal to `n`, `dp` has all elements equal to 0 except `dp[n]` which is equal to 1, `i` is 1, `2 * n + 1` is at least 4, `j` is 2**
