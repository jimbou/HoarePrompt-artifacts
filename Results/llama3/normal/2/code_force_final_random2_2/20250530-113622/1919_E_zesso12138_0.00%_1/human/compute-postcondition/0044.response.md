Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of integers, `MOD` is a constant integer, `dp` is a list of integers of length 2n + 1, `offset` is an integer equal to `n`, `new_dp` is a list of integers of length 2n + 1 where `new_dp[3]` is equal to `dp[2]` modulo `MOD`, the values in `p` are sorted in non-decreasing order and the absolute value of each element in `p` is less than or equal to `n`, `dp` has all elements equal to 0 except `dp[n]` which is equal to 1, `i` is 1, `2 * n + 1` is at least 4, `j` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `new_dp[3]` has been updated to be equal to `dp[2]` modulo `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `new_dp` now has a value at index 3, which is the result of the modular addition of the previous value at that index and `dp[2]`. The rest of the variables retain their original values and properties.
