Output State: **The program returns the value of dp at index final_sum, where final_sum is equal to p[-1] + n, p[-1] is the last element in the sorted list p, and n is a positive integer. The value of dp at index final_sum is calculated based on the previous values of dp, which are updated according to the conditions: if dp[j] is greater than 0, then dp[j + 1] is equal to (dp[j] + dp[j + 1]) % MOD if j + 1 is less than or equal to 2 * n, and dp[j - 1] is equal to (dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD if j is greater than or equal to 1.**
