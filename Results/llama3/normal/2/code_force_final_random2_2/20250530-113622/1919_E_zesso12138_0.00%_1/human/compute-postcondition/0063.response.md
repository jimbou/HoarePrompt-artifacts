Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of integers, `MOD` is a constant integer, `dp` is a list of integers of length 2n + 1, `offset` is an integer equal to `n`, `new_dp` is a list of integers of length 2n + 1 where `new_dp[2]` is equal to `(dp[1] + new_dp[2]) % MOD` and the rest of the elements are the same as before, the values in `p` are sorted in non-decreasing order and the absolute value of each element in `p` is less than or equal to `n`, `dp` has all elements equal to 0 except `dp[n]` which is equal to 1, `i` is 2, `2 * n + 1` is at least 1, `j` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `p`, `MOD`, `offset`, `i`, `2 * n + 1`, and `j` remain the same. The list `dp` also remains the same. The list `new_dp` is updated such that its second element (`new_dp[2]`) is now equal to the sum of the second element of `dp` (`dp[1]`) and the original value of `new_dp[2]`, modulo `MOD`. The rest of the elements in `new_dp` remain unchanged. The properties of `p` and `dp` are still valid.
