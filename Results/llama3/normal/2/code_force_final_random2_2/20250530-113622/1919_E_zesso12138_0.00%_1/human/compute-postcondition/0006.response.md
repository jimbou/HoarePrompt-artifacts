Output State: **n is an integer equal to the value at data[index], index is equal to its original value plus the new value of n plus 1 plus the new value of n, p is a list of n integers from data, results is a list containing four elements which are the results of func_1(n, p) for the old, new, newer and newest values of n and p, _ is 2, t must be greater than 2**

In this final state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer value at `data[index]`. The value of `index` has been incremented by 1, and then by the new value of `n`, resulting in a new value that is the original value plus the new value of `n` plus 1 plus the new value of `n`. The list `p` now contains `n` integers from `data`, starting from the new value of `index`. The list `results` has been appended with the result of `func_1(n, p)` for the newest values of `n` and `p`, in addition to the previous three elements. The values of `_` and `t` remain unchanged.
