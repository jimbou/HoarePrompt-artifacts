Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of integers, `MOD` is a constant integer, `dp` is a list of integers of length 2n + 1, `offset` is an integer equal to `n`, `new_dp` is a list of integers of length 2n + 1, the values in `p` are sorted in non-decreasing order and the absolute value of each element in `p` is less than or equal to `n`, `dp` has all elements equal to 0 except `dp[n]` which is equal to 1, `i` is 1, all elements of `new_dp` are equal to 0.**

In this output state, a new list `new_dp` is created with the same length as `dp`, but all its elements are initialized to 0. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their previous values and properties.
