Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of integers, `MOD` is a constant integer, `dp` is a list of integers of length 2n + 1, `offset` is an integer equal to `n`, `new_dp` is a list of integers of length 2n + 1 where `new_dp[j + 1]` is equal to `(dp[j] + new_dp[j + 1]) % MOD` and all other elements are equal to 0, the values in `p` are sorted in non-decreasing order and the absolute value of each element in `p` is less than or equal to `n`, `dp` has all elements equal to 0 except `dp[n]` which is equal to 1, `i` is 2, `2 * n + 1` is at least 1, `j` is 0. The current value of `dp[j]` is greater than 0. Additionally, `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `new_dp[j + 1]` has been updated to be the sum of `dp[j]` and the previous value of `new_dp[j + 1]`, modulo `MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged.
