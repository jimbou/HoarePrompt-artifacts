Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of integers, `MOD` is a constant integer, `dp` is a list of integers of length 2n + 1, `offset` is an integer equal to `n`, `new_dp` is a list of integers of length 2n + 1, the values in `p` are sorted in non-decreasing order and the absolute value of each element in `p` is less than or equal to `n`, `dp` has all elements equal to 0 except `dp[n]` which is equal to 1, `i` is 1, all elements of `new_dp` are equal to 0 except `new_dp[j + 1]` which is equal to `dp[j]` modulo `MOD`, `j` is 0, `2 * n + 1` is at least 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `p`, `MOD`, `offset`, and `i` remain the same. The list `dp` remains the same with all elements equal to 0 except `dp[n]` which is equal to 1. The list `new_dp` has all elements equal to 0 except `new_dp[j + 1]` which is now equal to the value of `dp[j]` modulo `MOD`. The value of `j` is still 0. The length of the lists `dp` and `new_dp` is still 2n + 1, which is at least 3.
