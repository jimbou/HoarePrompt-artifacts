Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers, `MOD` is a constant integer, `dp` is a list of integers of length 2n + 1, `offset` is an integer equal to `n`, the values in `p` are sorted in non-decreasing order and the absolute value of each element in `p` is less than or equal to `n`, `dp` has all elements equal to 0 except `dp[n]` which is equal to 1. If `dp[j]` is greater than 0, then if `j + 1` is less than or equal to 2 * `n`, `dp[j + 1]` is equal to (`dp[j + 1]` + `dp[j]`) % `MOD`, and if `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, then `dp[j - 1]` is equal to (`dp[j - 1]` + `dp[j]`) % `MOD`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `p`, `MOD`, and `offset` remain the same. The list `dp` is updated to be equal to `new_dp`, which means that the values in `dp` are now the same as the values in `new_dp` before the assignment. The values in `p` are still sorted in non-decreasing order and their absolute values are still less than or equal to `n`. The list `dp` still has all elements equal to 0 except `dp[n]` which is still equal to 1. The relationships between the elements of `dp` are still the same, meaning that if `dp[j]` is greater than 0, then `dp[j + 1]` and `dp[j - 1]` are updated accordingly based on the modulo operation with `MOD`.
