The code prints the first element in the `results` list, which contains the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all values of `n` and `p`. Since the exact values of `n` and `p` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of `func_1(n, p)` for the first set of values of `n` and `p`.

Output: **the result of func_1(n, p) for the first set of values of n and p (where n is the value at data[index] and p is a list of n integers from data)**
