The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the value at data[index], `index` is equal to its original value plus n plus 1, `p` is a list of n integers from data, `results` is a list containing one element which is the result of func_1(n, p), `_` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1**
