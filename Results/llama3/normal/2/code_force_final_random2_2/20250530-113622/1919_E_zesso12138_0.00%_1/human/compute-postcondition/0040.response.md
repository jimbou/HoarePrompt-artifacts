Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of integers, `MOD` is a constant integer, `dp` is a list of integers of length 2n + 1, `offset` is an integer equal to `n`, `new_dp` is a list of integers of length 2n + 1, the values in `p` are sorted in non-decreasing order and the absolute value of each element in `p` is less than or equal to `n`, `dp` has all elements equal to 0 except `dp[n]` which is equal to 1, `i` is 1, `2 * n + 1` is at least 3, `j` is 1, `new_dp[0]` is equal to `(new_dp[0] + dp[1])` modulo `MOD`, and if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, `new_dp[j + 1]` is equal to `dp[j]` modulo `MOD`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `p`, `MOD`, `dp`, `offset`, `i`, and `2 * n + 1` remain unchanged. The value of `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j])` modulo `MOD`, where `j` is 1. The other elements of `new_dp` remain unchanged.
