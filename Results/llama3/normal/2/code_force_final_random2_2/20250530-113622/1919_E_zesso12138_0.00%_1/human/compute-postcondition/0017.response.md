Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the value at `data[index]`, `index` is equal to its original value plus the sum of all values of `n` plus `t`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data`, `results` is a list containing `t` elements which are the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all values of `n` and `p`, `_` is `t-1`, `t` is equal to its original value, and all elements in `results` have been printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the state of the variables remains the same as the initial state, except that all elements in the `results` list have been printed. The loop has iterated over all elements in `results`, printing each one, and the variables `n`, `index`, `p`, `_`, and `t` retain their original values.
