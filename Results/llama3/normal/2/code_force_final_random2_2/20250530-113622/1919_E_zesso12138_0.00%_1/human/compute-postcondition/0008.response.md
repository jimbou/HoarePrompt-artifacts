To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `res` and `results`. The loop will execute if `results` has at least one element. Since `results` is a list containing `t` elements, we need to adjust the state of `t` to be at least 1.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the value at `data[index]`, `index` is equal to its original value plus the sum of all values of `n` plus `t`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data`, `results` is a list containing at least 1 element which are the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all values of `n` and `p`, `_` is `t-1`, `t` is at least 1, `res` is the first element in `results`**
