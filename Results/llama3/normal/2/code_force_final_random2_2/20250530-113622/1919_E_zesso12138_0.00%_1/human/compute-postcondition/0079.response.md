Functionality: **This function calculates the value of a dynamic programming array `dp` at a specific index `final_sum`, which is determined by the last element of a sorted list `p` and a positive integer `n`. The function iterates `n` times, updating the `dp` array based on the previous values and a modulo operation with a constant integer `MOD`. The final result is the value of `dp` at the index `final_sum`, which is calculated based on the cumulative sum of the previous values in the `dp` array.**
