Correctness: **True**.

The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem described. Here's a breakdown of why I believe the program is correct:

1. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row. It iterates through the row, adding 1 to each cell to account for the support cost, and then updates the cost of each cell based on the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells.

2. The `func_2` function correctly reads the input, calculates the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`, and then calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows. It finally prints the minimum total cost.

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when `k` is 1 or when `d` is 1, and it correctly calculates the minimum cost for each row and the total cost for each set of `k` consecutive rows.

Therefore, based on my analysis, I conclude that the program is correct.
