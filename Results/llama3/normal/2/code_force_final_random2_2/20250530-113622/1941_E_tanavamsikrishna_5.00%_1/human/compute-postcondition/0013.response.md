Output State: **row is a list of non-negative integers where the first d-1 elements are each increased by 1, and for all k such that d-1 <= k < len(row), the kth element of row is increased by the minimum of the first k+1 elements plus 1 plus the original value of the kth element plus 1, d is a positive integer such that d is at least 2 and d < len(row), and i is len(row).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of non-negative integers where the first d-1 elements are each increased by 1, and for all elements from the d-1th to the end of the list, each element is increased by the minimum of all previous elements plus 1, plus its original value plus 1. The value of d remains unchanged, and the value of i is now equal to the length of the list.
