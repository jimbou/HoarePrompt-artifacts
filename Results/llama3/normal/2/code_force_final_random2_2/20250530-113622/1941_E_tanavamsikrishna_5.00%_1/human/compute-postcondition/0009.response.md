Output: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, `rows` is a list of lists of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of at least `k` integers, `total_costs` is a list containing `len(costs) - (k - 1)` elements, where each element is the sum of `k` consecutive elements of `costs`, `i` is `len(costs) - (k - 1) - 1`, and the minimum sum of `k` consecutive elements of `costs` which is the minimum of `total_costs` is being printed**
