To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state. The loop head is `for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):`.

From this, we can see that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. Since `i` is currently 0, we need to increment it by 1 for the loop to execute again.

The state of `n`, `m`, `d`, `rows`, and `total_costs` does not affect the loop head, so we cannot adjust those states.

The state of `costs` is relevant because the loop head depends on its length. However, we cannot change the length of `costs` because it is not a variable in the loop head. We can only adjust the state of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, `rows` is a list of lists of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of at least `k` integers, `total_costs` is a list containing a single element, which is the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`, `i` is 1**
