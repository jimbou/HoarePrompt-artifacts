The code `total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))` appends the sum of the next `k` elements of `costs` to `total_costs`. The value of `i` is 1, so the sum of the next `k` elements of `costs` is the sum of the elements at indices 1 to `k` of `costs`. The value of `total_costs` is updated by appending this sum.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, `rows` is a list of lists of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of at least `k` integers, `total_costs` is a list containing two elements: the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs` and the sum of the next `k` elements of `costs`, `i` is 1**
