To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `costs`, as well as the expression `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. The loop will execute if `len(costs) - (k - 1)` is greater than 0.

Given the initial state:

- `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers.
- `rows` is a list of lists of non-negative integers where each inner list has length `m` and represents a row in the river grid.
- `costs` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of `func_1` applied to a row in `rows` and `d`.
- `total_costs` is an empty list.

We need to adjust the state so that `len(costs) - (k - 1)` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. This means `costs` must have at least `k` elements. Since `i` is the loop variable, it should start at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, `rows` is a list of lists of non-negative integers where each inner list has length `m` and represents a row in the river grid, `costs` is a list of at least `k` integers where each integer is the result of `func_1` applied to a row in `rows` and `d`, `total_costs` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
