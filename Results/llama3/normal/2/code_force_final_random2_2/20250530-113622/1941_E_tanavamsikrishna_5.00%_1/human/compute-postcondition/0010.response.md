Functionality: **This function calculates and prints the minimum sum of k consecutive elements in a list of costs, where each cost is determined by a sub-function (func_1) applied to each row in a given river grid with dimensions n x m and a given integer d. The function takes no arguments but reads the necessary input from the user, including the dimensions of the grid, the value of k, the value of d, and the grid itself. The function returns no value but prints the minimum sum of k consecutive costs to the console.**
