Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of minimizing the total cost of installing supports for bridges on a river grid. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes a list of non-negative integers `row` and a positive integer `d` as input. It first increments the first `d-1` elements of `row` by 1. Then, it iterates over the remaining elements of `row` and updates each element to be the minimum of the previous `d+1` elements plus 1, plus the original value of the element plus 1. Finally, it returns the last element of `row`, which represents the minimum cost of installing supports for a single bridge.

`func_2` takes no input and reads the input data from the standard input. It reads the number of rows `n`, columns `m`, number of bridges `k`, and maximum distance `d` between supports. It then reads the river grid data into a list of lists `rows`. For each row, it calls `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost of installing supports and stores the results in a list `costs`. It then calculates the total cost of installing supports for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and stores the results in a list `total_costs`. Finally, it prints the minimum total cost.

The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The use of `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost of installing supports for a single bridge is correct, and the use of `func_2` to calculate the total cost of installing supports for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows is also correct.

However, there is a small issue with the program. In `func_1`, the line `row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1` can be simplified to `row[i] = min(row[max(0, i - d):i]) + row[i] + 1`, as the `if i > 0 else 0` part is not necessary.

Correctness: **True**
