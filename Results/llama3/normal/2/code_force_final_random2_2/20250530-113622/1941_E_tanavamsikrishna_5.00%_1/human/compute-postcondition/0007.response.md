Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, `rows` is a list of lists of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of at least `k` integers, `total_costs` is a list containing `len(costs) - (k - 1)` elements, where each element is the sum of `k` consecutive elements of `costs`, `i` is `len(costs) - (k - 1) - 1`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` as in the initial state, and `rows` will remain unchanged. The `costs` list will still have at least `k` integers. The `total_costs` list will contain a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop iterates, which is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. Each element in `total_costs` will be the sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list, starting from the first element and moving forward. The loop variable `i` will have a value one less than the number of iterations, which is `len(costs) - (k - 1) - 1`.
