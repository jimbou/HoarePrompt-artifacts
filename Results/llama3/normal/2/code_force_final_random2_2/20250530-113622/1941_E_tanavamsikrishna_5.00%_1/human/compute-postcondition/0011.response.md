To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `d`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `d`. If `i` is less than `len(row)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `d`, and `d` is a positive integer such that `d` is at least 2 and `d` < `len(row)`.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `d + 1`. Since `d` is a constant in the loop head, its value remains the same.

State: **`row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first `d-1` elements are each increased by 1, and the `d-1`th element is increased by the minimum of the first `d-1` elements plus 1, `d` is a positive integer such that `d` is at least 2 and `d` < `len(row)`, `i` is `d + 1`, and the `d`th element of `row` is increased by the minimum of the first `d` elements plus 1**
