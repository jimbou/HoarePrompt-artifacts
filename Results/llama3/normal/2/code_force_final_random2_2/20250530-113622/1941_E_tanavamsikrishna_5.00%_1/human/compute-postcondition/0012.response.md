Output State: **`row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first `d-1` elements are each increased by 1, the `d-1`th element is increased by the minimum of the first `d-1` elements plus 1, the `d`th element is increased by the minimum of the first `d` elements plus 1, and the `d+1`th element is increased by the minimum of the first `d+1` elements plus 1 plus the original value of the `d+1`th element plus 1, `d` is a positive integer such that `d` is at least 2 and `d` < `len(row)`, and `i` is `d + 1`.**

In natural language, the code updates the `d+1`th element of the `row` list by adding the minimum value of the first `d+1` elements plus 1 to its original value, while keeping the other elements unchanged. The value of `d` and `i` remains the same.
