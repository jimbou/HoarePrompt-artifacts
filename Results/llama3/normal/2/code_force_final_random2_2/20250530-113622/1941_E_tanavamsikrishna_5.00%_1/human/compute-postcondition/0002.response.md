Let's break down the code step by step:

1. `total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))`:
	* `i` is 0, so `i:i + k` is equivalent to `0:k`.
	* `costs` is a list of at least `k` integers, so `costs[0:k]` is a slice of the first `k` elements of `costs`.
	* `sum(costs[0:k])` calculates the sum of these `k` elements.
	* `total_costs` is an empty list, so `append` adds a new element to the end of the list.

Now, let's calculate the output state:

* `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are still positive integers, unchanged.
* `rows` is still a list of lists of non-negative integers, unchanged.
* `costs` is still a list of at least `k` integers, unchanged.
* `total_costs` is no longer empty, it now contains a single element, which is the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`.
* `i` is still 0, unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, `rows` is a list of lists of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of at least `k` integers, `total_costs` is a list containing a single element, which is the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`, `i` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged as positive integers. The `rows` and `costs` lists also remain unchanged. However, the `total_costs` list now contains a single element, which is the sum of the first `k` elements of the `costs` list. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 0.
