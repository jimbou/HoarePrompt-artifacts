The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `costs`. If `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, `rows` is a list of lists of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of at least `k` integers, `total_costs` is a list containing two elements: the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs` and the sum of the next `k` elements of `costs`, `i` is 2**
