Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The problem description requires finding the minimum total cost of installing supports for k bridges on consecutive rows of a river, given the river's grid dimensions (n x m), the number of bridges (k), and the maximum distance between supports (d).

2. Function `func_1` calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row of the river. It takes a list of non-negative integers representing the row's depths and a positive integer d as input. The function modifies the list by incrementing the first d-1 elements by 1 and then for each element from the dth to the end of the list, it increments the element by the minimum of the previous d+1 elements plus 1, plus the original value of the element plus 1. The function returns the last element of the modified list, which represents the minimum cost of installing supports for that row.

3. Function `func_2` calculates and prints the minimum sum of k consecutive elements in a list of costs, where each cost is determined by `func_1` applied to each row in the given river grid. The function takes no arguments but reads the necessary input from the user, including the dimensions of the grid, the value of k, the value of d, and the grid itself. The function returns no value but prints the minimum sum of k consecutive costs to the console.

4. The main program iterates over the number of test cases, calling `func_2` for each test case. This ensures that the program correctly handles multiple test cases.

5. The execution summaries for `func_1` and `func_2` match their respective code and problem descriptions, indicating that the functions are implemented correctly.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions, the given program is correct.
