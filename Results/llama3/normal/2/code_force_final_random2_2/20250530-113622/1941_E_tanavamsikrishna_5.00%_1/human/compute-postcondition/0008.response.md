The code prints the minimum value in the `total_costs` list.
Since the exact values in the `costs` list are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the minimum in `total_costs`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the minimum sum of `k` consecutive elements of `costs`.
Output: **minimum sum of k consecutive elements of costs (where costs is the list of at least k integers)**
