The code appends the sum of the next `k` elements of `costs` to `total_costs`. The value of `i` is 2, so the sum of the next `k` elements of `costs` is from index 2 to 2 + `k`. The value of `total_costs` is updated by appending this sum.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, `rows` is a list of lists of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of at least `k` integers, `total_costs` is a list containing three elements: the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`, the sum of the next `k` elements of `costs`, and the sum of the next `k` elements of `costs` starting from index 2, `i` is 2**
