#State of the program right berfore the function call: row is a list of non-negative integers, d is a positive integer such that d < len(row).
    for i in range(0, d - 1):
        row[i] = row[i] + 1
        
    #State: `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first `d-1` elements are each increased by 1, `d` is a positive integer such that `d` is at least 2 and `d` < `len(row)`, `i` is `d-2`.
    for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
        row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
        
    #State: row is a list of non-negative integers where the first d-1 elements are each increased by 1, and for all k such that d-1 <= k < len(row), the kth element of row is increased by the minimum of the first k+1 elements plus 1 plus the original value of the kth element plus 1, d is a positive integer such that d is at least 2 and d < len(row), and i is len(row).
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the list 'row', which is the result of increasing the original value of the last element by the minimum of the first 'i' elements plus 1, where 'i' is equal to the length of the list 'row'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function accepts a list of non-negative integers and a positive integer d as input, where d is less than the length of the list. It modifies the list by incrementing the first d-1 elements by 1, and then for each element from the dth to the end of the list, it increments the element by the minimum of the previous d+1 elements plus 1, plus the original value of the element plus 1. The function returns the last element of the modified list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, k, and d are positive integers, and rows is a list of lists of non-negative integers where each inner list has length m and represents a row in the river grid.
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        
    #State: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, `rows` is a list of lists of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of at least `k` integers, `total_costs` is a list containing `len(costs) - (k - 1)` elements, where each element is the sum of `k` consecutive elements of `costs`, `i` is `len(costs) - (k - 1) - 1`.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: minimum sum of k consecutive elements of costs (where costs is the list of at least k integers)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and prints the minimum sum of k consecutive elements in a list of costs, where each cost is determined by a sub-function (func_1) applied to each row in a given river grid with dimensions n x m and a given integer d. The function takes no arguments but reads the necessary input from the user, including the dimensions of the grid, the value of k, the value of d, and the grid itself. The function returns no value but prints the minimum sum of k consecutive costs to the console.
