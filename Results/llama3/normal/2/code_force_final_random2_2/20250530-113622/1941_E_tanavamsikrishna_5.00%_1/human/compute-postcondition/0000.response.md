Output State: **n, m, k, and d are positive integers, rows is a list of lists of non-negative integers where each inner list has length m and represents a row in the river grid, costs is a list of integers where each integer is the result of func_1 applied to a row in rows and d, and total_costs is an empty list.**

The code first reads four positive integers from the input and assigns them to n, m, k, and d. Then, it reads n rows of m non-negative integers each from the input and stores them in the rows list. After that, it applies the func_1 function to each row in rows and d, and stores the results in the costs list. Finally, it initializes an empty list called total_costs.
