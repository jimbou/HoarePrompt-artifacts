Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of minimizing the total cost of installing supports for building bridges on consecutive rows of a river. The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes a row of the river and the maximum distance `d` between supports as input. It calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for that row by iterating through the row and updating the cost of each cell based on the minimum cost of the previous cells within the distance `d`. The function returns the total cost of installing supports for the row.

`func_2` reads the input data, which includes the number of rows `n`, the number of columns `m`, the number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance `d` between supports. It then reads the depths of the river cells for each row and calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for each row using `func_1`. The function then calculates the total cost of installing supports for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum total cost.

The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It iterates through each row and calculates the minimum cost of installing supports based on the previous cells within the distance `d`. It also correctly calculates the total cost of installing supports for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum total cost.

However, there is a small issue with the program. In the `func_1` function, the line `row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1` can be optimized. The `min` function is called for each cell, which can be inefficient for large inputs. Instead, the minimum cost of the previous cells within the distance `d` can be calculated and stored in a separate array, and then used to update the cost of each cell.

Despite this small issue, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
