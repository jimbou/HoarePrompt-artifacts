Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list of n positive integers that must have at least 3 elements, l is n, r is -1, i is n, ans is a list containing the product of p and the last element in the list b, the product of the original value of p and the second last element in the list b, and the product of the updated value of p and the third last element in the list b, p is the product of the original value of p, the last element in the list b, the second last element in the list b, and the third last element in the list b, v is the third last element in the list b**

The code snippet modifies the values of `p` and `ans`. The first line updates the value of `p` by multiplying it with `v`, which is the third last element in the list `b`. The second line appends the updated value of `p` to the list `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.
