Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R'. If the first character of s is 'L', then b is a list containing the first two elements of a, l is 1, r is n - 2, and i is 1. If the first character of s is 'R', then b is a list containing the last two elements of a, l is 0, r is n - 3, and i is 1. If s[i] is 'L', then b is a list containing the first element of a and the element of a at index l, l is 1 + the initial value of l, r is n - 1 - the initial value of l, i is 1. Otherwise, b is a list containing the first and last elements of a, l is 1, r is n - 2, and i is 1.***
