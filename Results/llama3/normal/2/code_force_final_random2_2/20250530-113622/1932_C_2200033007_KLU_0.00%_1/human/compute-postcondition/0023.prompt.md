Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list of n positive integers, l is n, r is -1, i is n, ans is an empty list, p is 1
Code of the loop:
for v in reversed(b):
    p = p * v
    ans.append(p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list of n positive integers that must have at least 1 element, l is n, r is -1, i is n, ans is a list containing the product of p and the last element in the list b, p is the product of the original value of p and the last element in the list b, v is the last element in the list b.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list of n positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, l is n, r is -1, i is n, ans is a list containing the product of p and the last element in the list b, and the product of the original value of p and the second last element in the list b, p is the product of the original value of p, the last element in the list b, and the second last element in the list b, v is the second last element in the list b.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list of n positive integers that must have at least 3 elements, l is n, r is -1, i is n, ans is a list containing the product of p and the last element in the list b, the product of the original value of p and the second last element in the list b, and the product of the updated value of p and the third last element in the list b, p is the product of the original value of p, the last element in the list b, the second last element in the list b, and the third last element in the list b, v is the third last element in the list b




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
