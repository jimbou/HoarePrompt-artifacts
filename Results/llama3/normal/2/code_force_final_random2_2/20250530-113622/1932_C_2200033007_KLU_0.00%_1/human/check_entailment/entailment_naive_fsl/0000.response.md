Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the way the product of the remaining elements is calculated after each command. The program calculates the product of all elements that have been removed so far, which is not what the problem description asks for. The problem description requires the product of all elements that are still in the array after each command.

For example, consider the input:

4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL

The correct output should be:

0 2 4 1

However, the program will output:

0 2 8 24

This is because the program calculates the product of all elements that have been removed so far, which is 3*1*4*2 = 24, instead of the product of the remaining elements, which is 1*4*2 = 8, and then 4*2 = 8, and finally 2 = 2.

To fix this issue, the program should calculate the product of the remaining elements after each command, not the product of all elements that have been removed so far.
