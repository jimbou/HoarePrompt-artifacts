You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R'.
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list of n positive integers, l is n, r is -1, i is n
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list of n positive integers, l is n, r is -1, i is n, ans is a list containing the product of the original value of p and each element in the list b in reverse order, p is the product of the original value of p and all elements in the list b, v is the first element in the list b.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a list containing the product of the original value of p and each element in the list b in reverse order. The list b contains n positive integers, and p is the product of the original value of p and all elements in the list b. The original value of p is not explicitly stated, but it is known to be a product of the original value of p and all elements in the list b. The list is in reverse order, meaning the last element of the original list is now the first element, the second last element is now the second element, and so on.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list containing the product of the original value of p and each element in the list b in reverse order. The list b contains n positive integers, and p is the product of the original value of p and all elements in the list b. The original value of p is not explicitly stated, but it is known to be a product of the original value of p and all elements in the list b. The list is in reverse order, meaning the last element of the original list is now the first element, the second last element is now the second element, and so on.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
