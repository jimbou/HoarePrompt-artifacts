Output State: **The program returns a list containing the product of the original value of p and each element in the list b in reverse order. The list b contains n positive integers, and p is the product of the original value of p and all elements in the list b. The original value of p is not explicitly stated, but it is known to be a product of the original value of p and all elements in the list b. The list is in reverse order, meaning the last element of the original list is now the first element, the second last element is now the second element, and so on.**
