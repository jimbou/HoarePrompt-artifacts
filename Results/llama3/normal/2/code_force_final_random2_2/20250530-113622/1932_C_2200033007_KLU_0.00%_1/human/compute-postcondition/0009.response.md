Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R'. If the first character of s is 'L', then b is a list containing the first and last elements of a, l is 1, r is n - 2, and i is 1. If the first character of s is 'R', then b is a list containing the last two elements of a, l is 0, r is n - 3, and i is 1.**

In this output state, the value of n and m remains unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The list a also remains unchanged. The string s also remains unchanged. 

The list b is modified by appending the element at index r of list a. The value of r is then decremented by 1. 

If the first character of s is 'L', then initially b contains the first element of a, l is 1, r is n - 1, and i is 1. After the code executes, b contains the first and last elements of a, l remains 1, r becomes n - 2, and i remains 1.

If the first character of s is 'R', then initially b contains the last element of a, l is 0, r is n - 2, and i is 1. After the code executes, b contains the last two elements of a, l remains 0, r becomes n - 3, and i remains 1.
