Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list containing one positive integer which is the last element of list a, l is 0, r is n - 2, and i is 0.**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables as follows: 

The first line appends the last element of list `a` to list `b`. Since `r` is `n - 1`, the last element of `a` is appended to `b`. 

The second line decrements `r` by 1, making it `n - 2`. 

No other variables are affected by the code snippet.
