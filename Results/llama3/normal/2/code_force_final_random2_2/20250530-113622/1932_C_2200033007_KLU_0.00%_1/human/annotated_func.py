#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R'.

    #State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list of n positive integers, l is n, r is -1, i is n, ans is a list containing the product of the original value of p and each element in the list b in reverse order, p is the product of the original value of p and all elements in the list b, v is the first element in the list b.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a list containing the product of the original value of p and each element in the list b in reverse order. The list b contains n positive integers, and p is the product of the original value of p and all elements in the list b. The original value of p is not explicitly stated, but it is known to be a product of the original value of p and all elements in the list b. The list is in reverse order, meaning the last element of the original list is now the first element, the second last element is now the second element, and so on.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of positive integers and a string of 'L' and 'R' characters as input, and returns a list of products in reverse order. The function first rearranges the input list based on the string, where 'L' means take from the left and 'R' means take from the right. Then, it calculates the cumulative product of the rearranged list and returns the result in reverse order.
