Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R'. If the first character of s is 'L', then b is a list containing the first element of a, l is 1, r is n - 1, and i is 0. If the first character of s is 'R', then b is a list containing the last element of a, l is 0, r is n - 2, and i is 0.***
