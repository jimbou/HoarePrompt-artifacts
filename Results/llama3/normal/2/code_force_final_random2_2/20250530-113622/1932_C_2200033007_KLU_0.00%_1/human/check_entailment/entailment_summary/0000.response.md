Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. 

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. `n` is the length of the array, `m` is the value to take the remainder by, `a` is the array of integers, and `s` is the string of commands.

2. It first initializes an empty list `b` to store the rearranged array, and two pointers `l` and `r` to keep track of the left and right ends of the array.

3. It then iterates over the string `s`. If the current character is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of the array to `b` and moves the left pointer to the right. If the current character is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of the array to `b` and moves the right pointer to the left.

4. After rearranging the array, it initializes an empty list `ans` to store the cumulative products, and a variable `p` to store the current product.

5. It then iterates over the rearranged array in reverse order. For each element, it multiplies the current product `p` by the element, appends the result to `ans`, and updates `p` with the new product.

6. Finally, it returns the list of cumulative products in reverse order.

The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the function.

Correctness: **True**
