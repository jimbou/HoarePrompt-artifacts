Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque with at least one element, `empty` is False, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`, and stdin contains a space-separated list of integers. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` has at least two elements and stdin contains a space-separated list of integers with at least one integer removed.***
