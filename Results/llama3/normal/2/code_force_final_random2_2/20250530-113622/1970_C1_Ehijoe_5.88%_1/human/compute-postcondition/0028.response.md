The code `tree.append(v)` adds the value of `v` to the end of the deque `tree`. Since `v` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`, the new element added to `tree` is also an integer within this range.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque with at least two elements, `empty` is False, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`, and stdin contains a space-separated list of integers with at least one integer removed.**

In natural language, the output state means that the deque `tree` now has at least two elements, with the new element being the value of `v`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains a space-separated list of integers, but with at least one integer removed (since `u` and `v` were assigned values from the input).
