The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, t is 1, tree is a deque with at least one element, empty is False, i is 1, u is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, v is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n. If tree was initially empty, it now contains two integers u and v. Otherwise, if tree was not empty, then if v is equal to the second element of tree, tree has at least two elements. Otherwise, if v is equal to the last element of tree, then u is appended to tree. If u is equal to the first element of tree, then v becomes the first element of tree and u becomes the second element of tree, and v is not equal to the last element of tree. If u is equal to the second last element of tree, then v is the last element of tree and u is not equal to the first element of tree and v is not equal to the last element of tree. Otherwise, u is not equal to the second last element of tree.**
