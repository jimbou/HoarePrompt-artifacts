The code `tree.appendleft(u)` adds the value of `u` to the left side of the deque `tree`. Since `u` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`, and is assigned the value of one of the integers from the input, the value of `u` is now added to the deque `tree`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque with at least two elements, the first element is `u` which is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`, `empty` is False, `i` is 1, `v` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`, and stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.**
