Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, t is 1, empty is False, i is 2, u and v are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, tree is a list containing the values of u and v.**

The code block modifies the state of the program by appending the values of `u` and `v` to the `tree` list and setting `empty` to `False`. The values of `n`, `t`, `i`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged. The `tree` list now contains the values of `u` and `v`, which are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`.
