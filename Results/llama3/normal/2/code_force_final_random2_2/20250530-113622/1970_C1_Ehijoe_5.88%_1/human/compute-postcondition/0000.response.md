Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, t is 1, tree is an empty deque, empty is True, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, and finally one integer u, where u is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n.**

The first line assigns the values of the first two integers from stdin to `n` and `t`, respectively. Since `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and `t` is 1, `n` becomes an integer greater than or equal to 2 and `t` becomes 1. The second line creates an empty deque and assigns it to `tree`. The third line assigns `True` to `empty`. No other variables are affected. The remaining lines in stdin are not modified by the code.
