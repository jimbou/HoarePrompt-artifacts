Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, t is 1, tree is an empty deque, empty is True, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, and finally one integer u, where u is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    u, v = map(int, input().split())
    if empty:
        tree.append(u)
        tree.append(v)
        empty = False
    elif v == tree[0]:
        tree.appendleft(u)
    elif v == tree[-1]:
        tree.append(u)
    elif u == tree[0]:
        tree.appendleft(v)
    elif u == tree[-1]:
        tree.append(v)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, t is 1, tree is a deque with at least one element, empty is False, i is 0, u is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, v is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n. If tree was initially empty, it now contains two integers u and v. Otherwise, if tree was not empty, then if v is equal to the second element of tree, tree has at least two elements. Otherwise, if v is equal to the last element of tree, then u is appended to tree. If u is equal to the first element of tree, then v becomes the first element of tree and u becomes the second element of tree, and v is not equal to the last element of tree. If u is equal to the second last element of tree, then v is the last element of tree and u is not equal to the first element of tree and v is not equal to the last element of tree. Otherwise, u is not equal to the second last element of tree.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `empty` is False, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`, and are assigned the values of the two integers from the input. If `empty` is True, then `tree` is a deque with at least three elements (the original element(s) and the appended values of `u` and `v`), and stdin is empty. If `empty` is False, then `tree` and stdin are updated based on the values of `u` and `v` in relation to the elements of `tree`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 2, `t` is 1, `empty` is False, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`. If `empty` is True, then `tree` is a list containing the values of `u` and `v`. Otherwise, if `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` now contains `u` as its first element. If `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains the value of `u`. If `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` is a list with `v` as its first element. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` is a list containing the value of `v`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `tree`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
