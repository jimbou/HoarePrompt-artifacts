Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque containing at least two elements, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, `v` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, and `v` is now the first element of `tree`, and the current value of `u` is equal to the second element of `tree`, and `v` is not equal to the last element of `tree`, stdin contains n-2 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, and finally one integer u, where u is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `v` is added to the front of the deque `tree`, making it the new first element. The current value of `u` is now the second element of `tree`. The values of `n`, `t`, `empty`, `i`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
