Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque with at least two elements, `empty` is False, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`, and are assigned the values of the two integers from the input, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `tree` has been updated to include the value of `v` at the leftmost position of the deque. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin is now empty since it has been used to assign values to `u` and `v`.
