Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `tree` is an empty deque, `empty` is True, `i` is 0, `u` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, `v` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, stdin contains n-2 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, and finally one integer u, where u is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `t`, `tree`, `empty`, and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `u` and `v` are assigned the values of the first two integers from the input, which are greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`. The stdin now contains `n-2` lines of input, each with two integers, and a single integer at the end.
