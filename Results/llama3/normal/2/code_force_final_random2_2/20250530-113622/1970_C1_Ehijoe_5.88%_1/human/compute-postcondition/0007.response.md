Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque with at least two elements, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, `v` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, and is equal to the second element of `tree`, stdin contains n-2 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, and finally one integer u, where u is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, `t` is still 1, `tree` now has at least two elements with `u` as the first element, `empty` is still False, `i` is still 0, `u` and `v` are still integers between 1 and `n`, and `v` is now the second element of `tree`. The stdin still contains n-2 lines of two integers each, followed by one integer.
