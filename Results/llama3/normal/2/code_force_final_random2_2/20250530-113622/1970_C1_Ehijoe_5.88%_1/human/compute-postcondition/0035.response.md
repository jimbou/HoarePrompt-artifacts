Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `t` is 1, `empty` is False, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`, and are assigned the values of the two integers from the input, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `t`, `empty`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `u` and `v` are updated to the two integers from the input, which are greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`. The stdin is empty after reading the two integers. The state of `tree` is not affected by this code snippet.
