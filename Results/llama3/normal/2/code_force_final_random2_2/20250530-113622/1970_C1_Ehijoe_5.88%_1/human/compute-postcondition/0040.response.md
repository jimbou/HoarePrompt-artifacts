Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `t` is 1, `empty` is False, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`, and are assigned the values of the two integers from the input, `tree` is a list containing the value of `v`**.

In this output state, the value of `tree` has been updated to include the value of `v`, which is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
