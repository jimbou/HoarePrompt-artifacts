Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque with at least one element, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`, `v` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`. If `v` is equal to the second element of `tree`, then `tree` has at least two elements. Otherwise, if `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `u` is appended to `tree`. If `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `v` becomes the first element of `tree` and `u` becomes the second element of `tree`, and `v` is not equal to the last element of `tree`. If `u` is equal to the second last element of `tree`, then `v` is the last element of `tree` and `u` is not equal to the first element of `tree` and `v` is not equal to the last element of `tree`. Otherwise, `u` is not equal to the second last element of `tree`.***
