Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `t` is 1, `empty` is False, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`, `tree` is a list with `v` as its first element.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `t`, `empty`, `i`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged. The only change is that the `tree` list now has `v` as its first element, which was appended to the left of the list using the `appendleft` method.
