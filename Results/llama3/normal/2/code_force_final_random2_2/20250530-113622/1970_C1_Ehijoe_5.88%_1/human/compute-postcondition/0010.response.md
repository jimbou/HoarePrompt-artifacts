Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque with `u` appended to it, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`, `v` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n` and is equal to the last element of `tree`, stdin contains n-3 lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, where `u` and `v` are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`, and finally one integer `u`, where `u` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, `t` is still 1, `tree` now has `u` appended to it, `empty` is still False, `i` is still 0, `u` is still an integer between 1 and `n`, `v` is still an integer between 1 and `n` and is equal to the last element of `tree`, and the stdin now has one less line containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u` at the end.
