Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `t` is 1, `empty` is False, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`. If `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` is a list with `v` as its first element. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` is a list containing the value of `v`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `tree`.***
