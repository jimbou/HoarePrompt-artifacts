Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `tree` is an empty deque, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, `v` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, stdin contains n-2 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, and finally one integer u, where u is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n. Additionally, `v` is not equal to the last element of `tree`***
