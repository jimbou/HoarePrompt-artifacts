Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `empty` is False, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`, and are assigned the values of the two integers from the input. If `empty` is True, then `tree` is a deque with at least three elements (the original element(s) and the appended values of `u` and `v`), and stdin is empty. If `empty` is False, then `tree` and stdin are updated based on the values of `u` and `v` in relation to the elements of `tree`.***
