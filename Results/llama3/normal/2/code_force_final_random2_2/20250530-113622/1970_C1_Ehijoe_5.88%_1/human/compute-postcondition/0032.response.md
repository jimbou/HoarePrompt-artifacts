Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `empty` is False, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`, and are assigned the values of the two integers from the input. If `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with at least two elements, the first element is `u` which is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`, and stdin contains a space-separated list of integers. If `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, then if `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` has at least two elements and stdin contains a space-separated list of integers with two less elements than before. If `v` is not equal to the last element of `tree`, then if `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, `tree` has at least two elements and stdin is empty. If `u` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, then if `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` has at least two elements and stdin contains a space-separated list of integers with at least one integer removed. Otherwise, `tree` has at least one element and stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.***
