Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque with at least two elements, `empty` is False, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`, and are assigned the values of the two integers from the input, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers with two less elements than before.**

In this output state, the value of `tree` has been updated to include the value of `u`, which is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains a space-separated list of integers with two less elements than before, since two integers were read from the input to assign values to `u` and `v`.
