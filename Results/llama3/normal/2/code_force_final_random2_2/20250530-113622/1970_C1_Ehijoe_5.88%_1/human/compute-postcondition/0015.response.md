Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque with at least one element, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, `v` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, stdin contains n-2 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, and finally one integer u, where u is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n. The current value of `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, and `v` is not equal to the last element of `tree` and `u` is not equal to the first element of `tree`***
