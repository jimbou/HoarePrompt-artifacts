Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, t is 1, tree is a deque with at least n elements, empty is False, i is n - 1, u is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, v is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, and stdin is empty.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is such that the value of `n` remains unchanged, `t` remains 1, the `tree` deque contains at least `n` elements, the `empty` flag is set to False, the loop counter `i` reaches `n - 1`, and the input buffer `stdin` is empty. The values of `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers read from the input.
