Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, t is 1, tree is a deque with at least n elements, empty is False, i is n - 1, u is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, v is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, start is an integer, idx is an integer, moves is a list with two elements, and stdin is empty.**

The code assigns the integer value of the input to `start`. Since stdin is empty, this line does not affect the state of stdin. The second line assigns the index of `start` in `tree` to `idx`. The third line assigns a list of two elements to `moves`. The first element is the minimum value between `t` and `idx`, and the second element is the minimum value between `t` and `n - idx - 1`. No other variables are affected.
