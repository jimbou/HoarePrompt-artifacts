Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque with at least one element, `empty` is False, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`, and are assigned the values of the two integers from the input, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, which is an integer greater than or equal to 2. The value of `t` remains the same, which is 1. The `tree` deque still has at least one element. The `empty` variable remains False. The value of `i` remains the same, which is 1. The values of `u` and `v` are updated to the two integers from the input, which are greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`. The stdin now contains a space-separated list of integers.
