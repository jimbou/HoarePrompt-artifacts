stdin contains three inputs: first two integers n and t, where n is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and t is 1, then n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, and finally one integer u, where u is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n.
