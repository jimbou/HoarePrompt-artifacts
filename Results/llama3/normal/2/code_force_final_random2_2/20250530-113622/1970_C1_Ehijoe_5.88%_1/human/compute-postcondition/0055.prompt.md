You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains three inputs: first two integers n and t, where n is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and t is 1, then n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, and finally one integer u, where u is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n.
    n, t = map(int, input().split())
    tree = deque()
    empty = True
    for i in range(n - 1):
        u, v = map(int, input().split())
        
        if empty:
            tree.append(u)
            tree.append(v)
            empty = False
        elif v == tree[0]:
            tree.appendleft(u)
        elif v == tree[-1]:
            tree.append(u)
        elif u == tree[0]:
            tree.appendleft(v)
        elif u == tree[-1]:
            tree.append(v)
        
    #State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, t is 1, tree is a deque with at least n elements, empty is False, i is n - 1, u is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, v is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, and stdin is empty.
    start = int(input())
    idx = tree.index(start)
    moves = [min(t, idx), min(t, n - idx - 1)]
    if any([(move % 2 == 1) for move in moves]) :
        print('Ron')
        #This is printed: Ron
    else :
        print('Hermione')
        #This is printed: Hermione
    #State: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, t is 1, tree is a deque with at least n elements, empty is False, i is n - 1, u is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, v is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, start is an integer, idx is an integer, moves is a list with two elements, and stdin is empty. If the list of moves contains at least one odd number, 'Ron' is printed. Otherwise, if all elements of the moves list are even, 'Hermione' is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, t is 1, tree is a deque with at least n elements, empty is False, i is n - 1, u is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, v is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, start is an integer, idx is an integer, moves is a list with two elements, and stdin is empty. The current value of moves contains at least one odd number, and 'Ron' is being printed

Case_2: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, t is 1, tree is a deque with at least n elements, empty is False, i is n - 1, u is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, v is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, start is an integer, idx is an integer, moves is a list with two elements, and stdin is empty. All elements of the moves list are even, and 'Hermione' is being printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
