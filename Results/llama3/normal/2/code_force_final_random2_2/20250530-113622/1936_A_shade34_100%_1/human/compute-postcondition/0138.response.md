Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is equal to `n+1`, `mak` is equal to `n`, the output buffer has been flushed `n+n+2` times, `pans` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `index` is 1, and this is printed: '?' followed by the second element of the `pans` list (`pans[n]`), the second element of the `pans` list (`pans[n]`), the `n`th element of the `pans` list (`pans[n]`), and the `n`th element of the `pans` list (`pans[n]`). If the current value of the input is '>', then the current value of the input is '>'. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the code `sys.stdout.flush()` has caused the output buffer to be flushed one more time, resulting in a total of `n+n+2` flushes. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
