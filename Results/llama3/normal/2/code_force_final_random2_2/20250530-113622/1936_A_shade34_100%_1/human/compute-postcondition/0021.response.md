Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is `n`, `_` is 0, and the output ? 0 0 1 1, ? 1 1 2 2, ..., ? `mak` `mak` `n-1` `n-1` are flushed to the console. If the input string is '<', then `mak` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `mak` is the largest index `i` such that the input string is '<' at iteration `i`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The number of test cases `n` is at least 1.
* The loop counter `i` has reached its final value, which is `n`.
* The variable `_` remains unchanged at 0.
* The console has been flushed with the output strings `? 0 0 1 1`, `? 1 1 2 2`, ..., `? mak mak n-1 n-1`, where `mak` is the largest index `i` such that the input string is '<' at iteration `i`.
* If the input string is '<' at the last iteration, then `mak` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `mak` is the largest index `i` such that the input string is '<' at iteration `i`.
