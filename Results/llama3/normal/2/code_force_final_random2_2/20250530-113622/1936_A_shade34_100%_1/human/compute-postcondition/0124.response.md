Postcondition: **n is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than 1, i is 2, the output buffer has been flushed n+4 times, '?' followed by the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is n, and the value of mak2 has been printed, '?' followed by the value of mak which is 0, the value of mak2 which is 0, the value of i which is n, and the value of mak2 which is 0, '?' followed by the value of mak which is 0, the value of mak2 which is 0, the value of i which is n, and the value of mak2 which is 0, '?' followed by the value of mak which is 0, the value of mak2 which is 0, the value of i which is 1, and the value of mak2 which is 0, '?' followed by the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is 2, and the value of mak2, s is a string containing the input value. If s is '<', then mak is 2, pans is a list containing 2, and mak2 is 0. If s is '=', then mak is 2, pans is a list containing one element which is 2, and mak2 is 0. If s is not '=' or '<', then mak is 2, pans is a list containing 2, and mak2 is 0, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is 2, and the value of mak2. If s is '<', then mak is 1, pans is a list containing 0, 2 and mak2 is 0. If s is '=', then mak is 0, pans is a list containing one element which is 0, 1, 2 and mak2 is 0. If s is not '=' or '<', then mak is 0, pans is a list containing 1, 2 and mak2 is 0, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is 2, and the value of mak2.**
