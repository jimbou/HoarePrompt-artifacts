The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and pans, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the pans.  If the list has at least 4 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, pans has at least 3 elements, i is 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 4 elements and the i is 3.
State: **`n` is at least n, `i` is 3, `s` is the input string, `pans` is a list containing all indices i such that the input string is '=' at iteration i and must have at least 4 elements, `mak2` is the largest index i such that the input string is '<' at iteration i, '?' followed by the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is n-1, and the value of mak2 has been printed, '?' followed by the first element of the list pans, the first element of the list pans, the last element of the list pans, the last element of the list pans, and the output buffer has been flushed, and the output buffer has been flushed again. If the current value of the input string is '>', then `mak` is 2, otherwise `mak` is either 0 or 1. The current value of the input string is either '>' or unchanged.**
