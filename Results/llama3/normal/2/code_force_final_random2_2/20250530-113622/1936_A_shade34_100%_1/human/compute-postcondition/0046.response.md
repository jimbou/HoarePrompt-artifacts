Output State: **n is at least 3, i is 2, s is the input string, mak is 2, pans is [2], mak2 is unchanged, and '?' followed by the unchanged value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is 2, and the value of mak2 has been printed.**

The code modifies the values of `mak` and `pans`. The first line assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `mak`, changing its value. The second line assigns a list containing the value of `i` (which is 2) to `pans`, changing its value. The other variables and the printed output remain unchanged.
