The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0, the output buffer has been flushed n+2 times, '?' followed by the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is n, and the value of mak2 has been printed, '?' followed by the value of mak which is 0, the value of mak2 which is 0, the value of i which is n, and the value of mak2 which is 0, '?' followed by the value of mak which is 0, the value of mak2 which is 0, the value of i which is n, and the value of mak2 which is 0. If s is '<', then s is '<' and pans is a list containing 0, mak2 is 0. If s is '=', then pans is a list containing one element which is 0, mak2 is 0. Otherwise, pans is an empty list, mak2 is 0.**
