Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, the output buffer has been flushed `n+len(pans)+n+3` times, stdin contains no input, and '?' followed by the value of `mak` (which is either 1 if `s` is '<', or not defined if `s` is not '<'), followed by the value of `mak2` (which is either 0 or `n-1` depending on the input), followed by the value of `i` which is 2, followed by the value of `mak2` (which is either 0 or `n-1` depending on the input), followed by the value of `s` (which is either '<' or not '<') has been printed. If the input string `s` is '<', then `pans` is [1, 2] and `mak2` is `n-1`. If `s` is '=', then `pans` is a list containing 0, 1, and 2. If `s` is not '<' and not '=', then `pans` is either an empty list or a list containing 0, and 2.**

In this output state, the value of `pans` has been updated by appending the value of `i`, which is 2. The other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
