Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `?` is a literal string that will be printed as is.
* `mak` is a variable that depends on the input string. If the input string is '<', then `mak` is 1. Otherwise, `mak` is 0. Since the precondition does not specify the input string, we cannot determine the exact value of `mak`. However, we can describe its value as "either 0 or 1, depending on the input string".
* `i` is a variable with a known value of 2.

Therefore, the print statement will output the string `?`, followed by the value of `mak` (either 0 or 1), followed by the value of `mak` again (either 0 or 1), followed by the value of `i` (2), and finally followed by the value of `i` again (2).

Output: **? [either 0 or 1, depending on the input string] [either 0 or 1, depending on the input string] 2 2**
