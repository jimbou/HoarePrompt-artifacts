Postcondition: ***`n` is at least n, `i` is 3, `s` is the input string, `pans` is a list containing all indices i such that the input string is '=' at iteration i and must have at least 4 elements, `mak2` is the largest index i such that the input string is '<' at iteration i. If the current value of the input string is '>', then `mak` is 3, otherwise `mak` is either 0 or 1. The value of mak2, the value of i which is n-1, and the value of mak2 has been printed, '?' followed by the value of mak, the value of mak, the value of i which is n-1, and the value of i which is n-1, and the output buffer has been flushed, and the output buffer has been flushed again, and the output buffer has been flushed again.***
