Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is at least n, i is n-1, s is the input string, mak is 0, pans is a list containing all indices i such that the input string is '=' at iteration i, mak2 is the largest index i such that the input string is '<' at iteration i, '?' followed by the unchanged value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is n-1, and the value of mak2 has been printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '>':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is at least n, `i` is 1, `s` is the input string, `mak` is either 0 or 1, `pans` is a list containing all indices i such that the input string is '=' at iteration i and must have at least 2 elements, `mak2` is the largest index i such that the input string is '<' at iteration i, '?' followed by the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is n-1, and the value of mak2 has been printed, and this is printed: '?' followed by the first element of the list pans, the first element of the list pans, the last element of the list pans, the last element of the list pans, and the output buffer has been flushed. The current value of the input string is either '>' or unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is at least n, `i` is 2, `s` is the input string, `pans` is a list containing all indices i such that the input string is '=' at iteration i and must have at least 3 elements, `mak2` is the largest index i such that the input string is '<' at iteration i, '?' followed by the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is n-1, and the value of mak2 has been printed, '?' followed by the first element of the list pans, the first element of the list pans, the last element of the list pans, the last element of the list pans, and the output buffer has been flushed, and the output buffer has been flushed again. If the current value of the input string is '>', then `mak` is 2, otherwise `mak` is either 0 or 1. The current value of the input string is either '>' or unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is at least n, `i` is 3, `s` is the input string, `pans` is a list containing all indices i such that the input string is '=' at iteration i and must have at least 4 elements, `mak2` is the largest index i such that the input string is '<' at iteration i. If the current value of the input string is '>', then `mak` is 3, otherwise `mak` is either 0 or 1. The value of mak2, the value of i which is n-1, and the value of mak2 has been printed, '?' followed by the value of mak, the value of mak, the value of i which is n-1, and the value of i which is n-1, and the output buffer has been flushed, and the output buffer has been flushed again, and the output buffer has been flushed again.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
