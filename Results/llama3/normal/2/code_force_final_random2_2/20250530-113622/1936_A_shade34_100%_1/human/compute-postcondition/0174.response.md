To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `pans` is an empty list, `index` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed `n+len(pans)+n` times, `stdin` contains no input, `mak2` is 0 if the input is not '<', otherwise `mak2` is `n-1`**
