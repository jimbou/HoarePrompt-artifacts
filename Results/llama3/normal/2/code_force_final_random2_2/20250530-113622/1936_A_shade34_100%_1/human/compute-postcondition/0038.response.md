The code assigns the value of `i` to `mak`, and appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Since `i` is 1, `mak` becomes 1, and `pans` becomes `[1]`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `s` also remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The output remains '?' followed by the unchanged value of `mak`, the value of `mak2`, the value of `i` which is 1, and the value of `mak2`.

Output State: **n is at least 2, i is 1, s is the input string, mak is 1, pans is [1], and the output is '?' followed by the unchanged value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is 1, and the value of mak2.**
