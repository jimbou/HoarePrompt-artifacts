The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `index` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed `n+len(pans)+3` times, `stdin` contains no input, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 2 and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is 2, followed by the value of `mak` again which is 2, followed by the value of `i` which is 3, and finally followed by the value of `i` again which is 3. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0 and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is 0, followed by the value of `mak` again which is 0, followed by the value of `i` which is 3, and finally followed by the value of `i` again which is 3.**
