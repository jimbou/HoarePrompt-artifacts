Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, i is equal to n, the output buffer has been flushed n+n times, '?' followed by the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is n, and the value of mak2 has been printed, '?' followed by the value of mak which is either 0 or the last index i of the loop, the value of mak2 which is 0, the value of i which is n, and the value of mak2 which is 0, '?' followed by the value of mak which is either 0 or the last index i of the loop, the value of mak2 which is 0, the value of i which is n, and the value of mak2 which is 0, '?' followed by the value of mak which is either 0 or the last index i of the loop, the value of mak2 which is 0, the value of i which is n-1, and the value of mak2 which is 0, '?' followed by the value of mak which is either 0 or the last index i of the loop, the value of mak2 which is 0, the value of i which is n-1, and the value of mak2 which is 0, and for each iteration of the loop, if the current value of the input string is '>', then mak is the last index i of the loop, otherwise mak is either 0 or the last index i of the loop, the current value of the input string is either '>' or unchanged, and this is printed: '!' followed by the value of mak2, and the value of pans[mak], and '?' followed by the value of mak which is either 0 or the last index i of the loop, the value of mak which is either 0 or the last index i of the loop, the value of i which is n-1, and the value of i which is n-1 is being printed. If the input string is '<', then the current value of the input string is '<', otherwise it is unchanged, and mak is now 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '>':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, `mak` is equal to `n`, the output buffer has been flushed `n+n+1` times, `pans` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `index` is 1, and this is printed: '?' followed by the second element of the `pans` list (`pans[n]`), the second element of the `pans` list (`pans[n]`), the `n`th element of the `pans` list (`pans[n]`), and the `n`th element of the `pans` list (`pans[n]`). If the current value of the input is '>', then the current value of the input is '>'. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is equal to `n+1`, `mak` is equal to `n` if the input is not '>', otherwise `mak` is equal to `n+1`, the output buffer has been flushed `n+n+2` times, `pans` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `index` is 1, and this is printed: '?' followed by the second element of the `pans` list (`pans[1]`), the second element of the `pans` list (`pans[1]`), the `n`th element of the `pans` list (`pans[n]`), and the `n`th element of the `pans` list (`pans[n]`). If the current value of the input is '>', then the current value of the input is '>'. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is 2, the output buffer has been flushed `n+n+3` times, `pans` is a list that must have at least 4 elements, `index` is 1, and this is printed: '?' followed by the second element of the `pans` list (`pans[1]`), the second element of the `pans` list (`pans[1]`), the `n`th element of the `pans` list (`pans[n]`), and the `n`th element of the `pans` list (`pans[n]`). If the current value of the input is '>', then `mak` is 2 and the current value of the input is '>'. Otherwise, `mak` is equal to `n` if the input is not '>', and the state of the program remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
