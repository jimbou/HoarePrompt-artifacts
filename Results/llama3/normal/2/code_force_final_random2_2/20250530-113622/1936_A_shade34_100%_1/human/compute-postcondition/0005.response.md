Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0, `_` is 0, and the output ? 0 0 1 1 is flushed to the console, meaning it is displayed immediately without buffering.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `mak`, and `_` remain unchanged. The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call only affects the output buffer, ensuring that the printed string ? 0 0 1 1 is displayed immediately on the console. The stdin remains empty as it was before the code execution.
