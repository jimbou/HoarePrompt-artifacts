Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `pans[mak]`: Since `mak` is not defined in the precondition, we assume it's a variable that has been defined elsewhere in the code. However, without knowing its value, we can't determine the exact element of the `pans` list that will be printed. Let's call this element `x`.
* `pans[mak]` (second occurrence): Same as above, this will print the same element `x`.
* `pans[i]`: Since `i` is equal to `n`, this will print the element at index `n` in the `pans` list. Let's call this element `y`.
* `pans[i]` (second occurrence): Same as above, this will print the same element `y`.

So, the print statement will output four elements: `x`, `x`, `y`, and `y`.

Output: **x (where x is the element at index mak in the pans list), x (where x is the element at index mak in the pans list), y (where y is the element at index n in the pans list), y (where y is the element at index n in the pans list)**
