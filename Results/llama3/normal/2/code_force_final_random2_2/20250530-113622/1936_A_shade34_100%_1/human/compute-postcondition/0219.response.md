Output State: **`n` is at least n, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to n-1 if s is '=', or a list containing all values from 0 to n-2 or a list containing all values from 1 to n-1 if s is not '<' and not '=', `index` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed n+len(pans)+n+n+3 times, stdin contains no input, `mak2` is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input, and this is printed: '?' followed by the 4th element of the list `pans` (pans[mak]) twice, followed by the 4th element of the list `pans` (pans[i]) twice.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, which means it forces the output to be displayed immediately. The output buffer has been flushed n+len(pans)+n+n+2 times before this code, and now it has been flushed one more time, making it a total of n+len(pans)+n+n+3 times. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
