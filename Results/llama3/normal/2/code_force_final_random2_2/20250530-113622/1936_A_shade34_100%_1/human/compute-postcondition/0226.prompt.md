Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains one input: an integer (the number of test cases) followed by a series of test cases. Each test case contains one integer (n) followed by a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '<':
            mak = i
    mak2 = mak
    pans = []
    for i in range(n):
        print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        s = str(input())
        if s == '<':
            mak = i
            pans = [i]
        elif s == '=':
            pans.append(i)
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, len(pans)):
        print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '>':
            mak = i
    print('!', mak2, pans[mak])
    sys.stdout.flush()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least n, `i` is len(pans)-1, `s` is the input string, `pans` is a list containing all indices i such that the input string is '=' at iteration i, `mak2` is the largest index i such that the input string is '<' at iteration i, the output buffer has been flushed twice, '?' followed by the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is n-1, and the value of mak2 has been printed, and this is printed: '?' followed by the first element of the list pans, the first element of the list pans, the last element of the list pans, the last element of the list pans, and for each iteration of the loop, if the current value of the input string is '>', then `mak` is the last index i of the loop, otherwise `mak` is either 0 or the last index i of the loop, the current value of the input string is either '>' or unchanged, and this is printed: '!' followed by the value of mak2, and the value of pans[mak].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is equal to `len(pans)`, `mak` is equal to `len(pans)-1` if the input is '>', otherwise `mak` is equal to `n`, the output buffer has been flushed `n+len(pans)+1` times, `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `index` is 1, and this is printed: '?' followed by the second element of the `pans` list (`pans[1]`), the second element of the `pans` list (`pans[1]`), the `n`th element of the `pans` list (`pans[n]`), and the `n`th element of the `pans` list (`pans[n]`). If the current value of the input is '>', then the current value of the input is '>', and this is printed: '!' followed by the value of `mak2` and the `mak`th element of the `pans` list (`pans[mak]`). Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is at least n, `i` is len(pans), `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to n-1 if s is '=', or a list containing all values from 0 to n-2 or a list containing all values from 1 to n-1 if s is not '<' and not '=', `index` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed n+len(pans)+n+n+len(pans)+1 times, stdin contains no input, `mak2` is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input, `mak` is len(pans)-1 and '?' followed by the value of mak (which is len(pans)-1), followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of i which is len(pans)-1, followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of s (which is '>') has been printed, pans must have at least len(pans) elements, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of pans[mak] (which is pans[len(pans)-1]), followed by the value of pans[mak] (which is pans[len(pans)-1]), followed by the value of pans[i] (which is pans[len(pans)-1]), followed by the value of pans[i] (which is pans[len(pans)-1]), and this is printed: '!' followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of pans[mak] (which is pans[len(pans)-1])




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
