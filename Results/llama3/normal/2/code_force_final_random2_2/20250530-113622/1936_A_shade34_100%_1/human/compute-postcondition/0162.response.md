Output: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `index` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed `n+len(pans)+2` times, `stdin` contains no input, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 1, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` (which is either 0 or 1 depending on the input), followed by the value of `mak` again, followed by the value of `i` which is 2, and finally followed by the value of `i` again which is 2**
