Output State: **`n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `index` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed `n+len(pans)+n` times, `stdin` contains no input. If the input is '<', then `mak` is `n-1` and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is `n-1`, followed by the value of `mak` again which is `n-1`, followed by the value of `i` which is `n-1`, and finally followed by the value of `i` again which is `n-1`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0 and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is 0, followed by the value of `mak` again which is 0, followed by the value of `i` which is `n-1`, and finally followed by the value of `i` again which is `n-1`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be one less than the initial value of `n`, and the output buffer will have been flushed a total of `n` plus the length of `pans` plus `n` times. The value of `mak` will be either `n-1` or 0, depending on whether the input was '<' or not, and the corresponding output will be printed. The state of the other variables, including `pans` and `index`, remains unchanged.
