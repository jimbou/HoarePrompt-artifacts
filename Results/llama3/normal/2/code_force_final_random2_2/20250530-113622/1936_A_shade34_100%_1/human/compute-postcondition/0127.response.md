Output State: **n is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, i is equal to n, the output buffer has been flushed n+n times, '?' followed by the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is n, and the value of mak2 has been printed, '?' followed by the value of mak which is either 0 or the last index i of the loop, the value of mak2 which is 0, the value of i which is n, and the value of mak2 which is 0, '?' followed by the value of mak which is either 0 or the last index i of the loop, the value of mak2 which is 0, the value of i which is n, and the value of mak2 which is 0, '?' followed by the value of mak which is either 0 or the last index i of the loop, the value of mak2 which is 0, the value of i which is n-1, and the value of mak2 which is 0, '?' followed by the value of mak which is either 0 or the last index i of the loop, the value of mak2 which is 0, the value of i which is n-1, and the value of mak2 which is 0, and for each iteration of the loop, if the current value of the input string is '>', then mak is the last index i of the loop, otherwise mak is either 0 or the last index i of the loop, the current value of the input string is either '>' or unchanged, and this is printed: '!' followed by the value of mak2, and the value of pans[mak], and '?' followed by the value of mak which is either 0 or the last index i of the loop, the value of mak which is either 0 or the last index i of the loop, the value of i which is n-1, and the value of i which is n-1 is being printed. If the input string is '<', then the current value of the input string is '<', otherwise it is unchanged, and mak is now 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of mak has been reset to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
