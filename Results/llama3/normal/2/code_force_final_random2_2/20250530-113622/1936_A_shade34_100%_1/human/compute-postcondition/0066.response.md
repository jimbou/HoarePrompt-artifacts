The code prints a string containing a '?' followed by the value of pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], and pans[i]. The value of pans[mak] is the element at index mak in the list pans, which contains all indices i such that the input string is '=' at iteration i. The value of pans[i] is the element at index i in the list pans, which is n-1. Since the value of mak is either 0, 1, or 2, the value of pans[mak] is either the first, second, or third element of the list pans. The value of pans[i] is the last element of the list pans.

Output: **? [the element at index mak in the list pans], [the element at index mak in the list pans], [the last element of the list pans], [the last element of the list pans]**
