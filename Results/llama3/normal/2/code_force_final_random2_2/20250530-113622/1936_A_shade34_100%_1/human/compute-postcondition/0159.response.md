Postcondition: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `index` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed `n+len(pans)+2` times, `stdin` contains no input, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 1, otherwise `mak` remains 0.**
