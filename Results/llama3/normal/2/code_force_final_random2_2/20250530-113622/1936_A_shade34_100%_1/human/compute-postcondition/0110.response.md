Based on the precondition, the print statement will print a string that includes the following values:

* '?' : a literal question mark character
* mak : the value of mak, which is 0
* mak2 : the value of mak2, which is 0
* i : the value of i, which is n (an integer greater than 1)
* mak2 : the value of mak2 again, which is 0

Therefore, the output will be a string that includes these values, separated by spaces.

Output: **? 0 0 n 0**
