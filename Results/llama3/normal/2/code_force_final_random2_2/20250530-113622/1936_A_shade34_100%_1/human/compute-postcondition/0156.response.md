Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0, `pans` is a list that must have at least len(pans) elements, `index` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed `n+len(pans)+2` times, `stdin` contains no input, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, which means it forces the output to be displayed immediately. Since the output buffer has already been flushed `n+len(pans)+1` times, this additional flush increases the count to `n+len(pans)+2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the printed output remains the same.
