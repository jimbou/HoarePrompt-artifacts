The code prints a string containing a question mark, the value of `mak`, the value of `mak2`, the value of `i`, and the value of `mak2` again.

Since the value of `mak` is not provided in the initial state, we can't determine its exact value. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `mak`.

The value of `mak2` is either 0 or `n-1`, depending on the input. Since the input is not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `mak2`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `mak2`.

The value of `i` is 0, as specified in the initial state.

Therefore, the output will be a string containing a question mark, the value of `mak`, the value of `mak2`, 0, and the value of `mak2` again.

Output: **? [mak] [mak2] 0 [mak2] (where mak is the value of mak and mak2 is either 0 or n-1)**
