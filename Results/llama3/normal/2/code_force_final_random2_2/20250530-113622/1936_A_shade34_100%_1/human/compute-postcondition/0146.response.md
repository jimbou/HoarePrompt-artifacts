Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is 2, the output buffer has been flushed `n+n+3` times, `pans` is a list that must have at least 4 elements, `index` is 1, and this is printed: '?' followed by the second element of the `pans` list (`pans[1]`), the second element of the `pans` list (`pans[1]`), the `n`th element of the `pans` list (`pans[n]`), and the `n`th element of the `pans` list (`pans[n]`). If the current value of the input is '>', then `mak` is 2 and the current value of the input is '>'. Otherwise, `mak` is equal to `n` if the input is not '>', and the state of the program remains unchanged.***
