Output State: **n is at least 2, i is 1, pans is a list containing 0 and 1, index is 1, the output buffer has been flushed n+len(pans)+n+2 times, stdin contains no input, mak2 is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input, and '?' followed by the value of mak (which is not defined in the precondition), followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of i which is 1, followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of s (which is either '<' or not '<') has been printed. If the input string s is '<', then mak2 is n-1. If s is not '<', then mak2 is either 0 or n-1.**

In this output state, the value of pans has been updated to include the value of i, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer has been flushed the same number of times as before. The value of mak2 is still dependent on the input, and the output has been printed as before.
