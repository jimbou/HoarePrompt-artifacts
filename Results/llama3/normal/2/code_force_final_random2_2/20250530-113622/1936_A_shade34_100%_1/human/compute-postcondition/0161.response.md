Based on the initial state, let's break down the variables and objects involved in the print statement:

* `n` is at least 3, but its exact value is not specified.
* `i` is 2.
* `pans` is a list with at least `len(pans)` elements, but its contents are not specified.
* `index` is 1, but it is not used in the print statement.
* The output buffer has been flushed `n+len(pans)+2` times, but this information is not relevant to the print statement.
* `stdin` contains no input, which means that the input is not relevant to the print statement.
* The input is '<', which means that `mak` is 1.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print('?', mak, mak, i, i)`

The print statement will print the following values:

* '?' is a literal string that will be printed as is.
* `mak` is 1, which will be printed twice.
* `i` is 2, which will be printed twice.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **? 1 1 2 2**
