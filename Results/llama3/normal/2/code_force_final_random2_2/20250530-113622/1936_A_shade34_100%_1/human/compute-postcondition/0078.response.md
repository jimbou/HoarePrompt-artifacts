Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

The print statement is: `print('?', mak, mak, i, i)`

From the precondition, we know:

* `mak` is 0
* `i` is `n`, which is an integer greater than 1

So, when the print statement is executed, it will print:

* '?' (a literal string)
* `mak`, which is 0
* `mak` again, which is still 0
* `i`, which is `n`
* `i` again, which is still `n`

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **? 0 0 n n**
