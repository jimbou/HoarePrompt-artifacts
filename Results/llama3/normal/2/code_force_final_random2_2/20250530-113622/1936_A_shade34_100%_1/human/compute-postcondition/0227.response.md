Functionality: **The function reads input from stdin, processes a series of test cases, and outputs the results to stdout. For each test case, it finds the maximum value in a permutation of integers and its corresponding index, and then outputs the index of the maximum value and the value itself. The function iteratively queries the input to determine the maximum value and its index, and it flushes the output buffer after each query and after the final output. The function processes all test cases and produces a final output in the format '! <index> <value>'.**
