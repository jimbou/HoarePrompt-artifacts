Based on the precondition, we know that `n` is at least 1 and `i` is 0. However, we don't have any information about the values of `mak` and `mak2`.

Since `mak` and `mak2` are not defined in the precondition, we cannot determine their exact values. Therefore, we can only describe their values as "unknown" or "undefined".

The value of `i` is known to be 0.

So, when the print statement is executed, it will print the string '?' followed by the unknown values of `mak` and `mak2`, the value of `i` which is 0, and again the unknown value of `mak2`.

Output: **? [unknown value of mak] [unknown value of mak2] 0 [unknown value of mak2]**
