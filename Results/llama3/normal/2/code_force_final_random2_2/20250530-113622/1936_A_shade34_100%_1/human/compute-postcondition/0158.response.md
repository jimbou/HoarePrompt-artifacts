Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mak` is 1, `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `index` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed `n+len(pans)+2` times, `stdin` contains no input, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1. The current value of the input is '<'.**

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
