Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `index` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed `n+len(pans)+3` times, `stdin` contains no input, `mak` is 2, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, then '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is 2, followed by the value of `mak` again which is 2, followed by the value of `i` which is 2, and finally followed by the value of `i` again which is 2.**
