Output State: **`n` is at least n, `i` is n-1, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to n-1 if s is '=', or a list containing all values from 0 to n-2 or a list containing all values from 1 to n-1 if s is not '<' and not '=', `index` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed n+len(pans)+n+n times, stdin contains no input, `mak2` is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input, `mak` is 0, and '?' followed by the value of mak (which is 0), followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of i which is n-1, followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of s (which is either '<' or not '<') has been printed.**

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been updated to 0, regardless of the input string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the output buffer has been flushed the same number of times as before. The value of `mak2` is still either 0 or n-1 depending on the input, and the output buffer contains the same string as before, but with the value of `mak` updated to 0.
