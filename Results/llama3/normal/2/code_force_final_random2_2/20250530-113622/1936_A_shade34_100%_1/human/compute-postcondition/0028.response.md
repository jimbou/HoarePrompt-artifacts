Output State: **n is at least 1, i is 0, s is '<', mak is 0, pans is [0]**.

The code block assigns the value of `i` to `mak`, making `mak` equal to 0. It also creates a list `pans` containing the value of `i`, which is 0. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code. The value of `i` also remains unchanged, as it is only used to assign values to `mak` and `pans`, but its own value is not modified.
