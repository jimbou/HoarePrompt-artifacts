Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and the final output state is determined by the last iteration of the loop. The value of `n` is the number of test cases, `i` is `len(pans)-1`, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` such that the input string is '=' at iteration `i`, `mak2` is the largest index `i` such that the input string is '<' at iteration `i`, and `mak` is the index of the maximum value in `pans`. The output buffer has been flushed a total of `n+len(pans)+n+len(pans)+1` times. The final output is '!' followed by the value of `mak2` and the value of `pans[mak]`.**

In natural language, the loop has finished executing, and the final output state is determined by the last iteration of the loop. The number of test cases `n` has been processed, and the list `pans` contains all indices `i` where the input string is '=' at iteration `i`. The variable `mak2` stores the largest index `i` where the input string is '<' at iteration `i`, and `mak` stores the index of the maximum value in `pans`. The output buffer has been flushed a total of `n+len(pans)+n+len(pans)+1` times, and the final output is '!' followed by the value of `mak2` and the value of `pans[mak]`.
