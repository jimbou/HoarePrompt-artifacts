To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(pans)):`.

From the given state, we know that `i` is 1, and `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` such that the input string is '=' at iteration `i` and must have at least 2 elements.

For the loop to execute again, the condition `i` < `len(pans)` must be true. Since `i` is currently 1, we need to increment it to 2. Additionally, `pans` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to continue.

The other variables `n`, `s`, `mak`, `mak2`, and the output buffer are not directly involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is at least n, `i` is 2, `s` is the input string, `mak` is either 0 or 1, `pans` is a list containing all indices i such that the input string is '=' at iteration i and must have at least 3 elements, `mak2` is the largest index i such that the input string is '<' at iteration i, '?' followed by the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is n-1, and the value of mak2 has been printed, and this is printed: '?' followed by the first element of the list pans, the first element of the list pans, the last element of the list pans, the last element of the list pans, and the output buffer has been flushed. The current value of the input string is either '>' or unchanged.**
