To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Since `i` starts at 1, it will increment by 1 at the end of each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, we need to increment `i` by 1, making it 3.

The state of `n` does not need to change, as it is not modified by the loop. The other variables (`_`, `mak`, and the output) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not affect the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `_` is 0, the output ? 0 0 1 1 is flushed to the console, and the output is flushed to the console. If the input string is '<', then `mak` is 2. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
