Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `_` is 0, the output ? 0 0 1 1 is flushed to the console, and the output is flushed to the console.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output to the console, which means that the output ? 0 0 1 1 is now visible on the console. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, and `_` remain unchanged, and the condition on `mak` is still valid. The output is now flushed to the console, indicating that the output buffer is empty.
