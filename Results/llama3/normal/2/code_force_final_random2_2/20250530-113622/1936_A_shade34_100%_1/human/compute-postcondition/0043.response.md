Based on the initial state, we can determine the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

The print statement is: `print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)`

From the initial state, we know:

* `mak` is 1 if `s` is '<', otherwise unchanged. Since `s` is not specified to be '<', we assume `mak` is unchanged, but its initial value is not provided. Let's call it "initial value of mak".
* `mak2` is unchanged, but its initial value is not provided. Let's call it "initial value of mak2".
* `i` is 2.
* The output is '?' followed by the unchanged value of `mak`, the value of `mak2`, the value of `i` which is 2, and the value of `mak2`.

So, the print statement will output:

Output: **? [initial value of mak] [initial value of mak2] 2 [initial value of mak2]**

Note that we cannot provide a more precise description of the output without knowing the initial values of `mak` and `mak2`.
