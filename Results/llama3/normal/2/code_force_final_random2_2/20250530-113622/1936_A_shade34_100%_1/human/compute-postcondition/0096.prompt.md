Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the input value, mak is 0, i is len(pans), s is the input string, pans is a list containing all indices i such that the input string is '=' at iteration i, mak2 is the largest index i such that the input string is '<' at iteration i, the output buffer has been flushed three times, '?' followed by the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is n, and the value of mak2 has been printed, and this is printed: '?' followed by the first element of the list pans, the first element of the list pans, the last element of the list pans, the last element of the list pans, and for each iteration of the loop, if the current value of the input string is '>', then `mak` is the last index i of the loop, otherwise `mak` is either 0 or the last index i of the loop, the current value of the input string is either '>' or unchanged, and this is printed: '!' followed by the value of mak2, and the value of pans[mak].
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '<':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than 1, `mak` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `s` is the input string, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` such that the input string is '=' at iteration `i`, `mak2` is the largest index `i` such that the input string is '<' at iteration `i`, the output buffer has been flushed four times, '?' followed by the value of `mak`, the value of `mak2`, the value of `i` which is `n`, and the value of `mak2` has been printed, and this is printed: '?' followed by the first element of the list `pans`, the first element of the list `pans`, the last element of the list `pans`, the last element of the list `pans`, and for each iteration of the loop, if the current value of the input string is '>', then `mak` is the last index `i` of the loop, otherwise `mak` is either 0 or the last index `i` of the loop, the current value of the input string is either '>' or unchanged, and this is printed: '!' followed by the value of `mak2`, and the value of `pans[mak]`, and '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is either 0 or 1, the value of `mak` which is either 0 or 1, the value of `i` which is 1, and the value of `i` which is 1 is being printed. If the input string is '<', then the current value of the input string is '<', otherwise it is unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than 1, `mak` is either 0, 1, or 2, `i` is 2, `s` is the input string, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` such that the input string is '=' at iteration `i`, `mak2` is the largest index `i` such that the input string is '<' at iteration `i`, the output buffer has been flushed five times, '?' followed by the value of `mak`, the value of `mak2`, the value of `i` which is `n`, and the value of `mak2` has been printed, and this is printed: '?' followed by the first element of the list `pans`, the first element of the list `pans`, the last element of the list `pans`, the last element of the list `pans`, and for each iteration of the loop, if the current value of the input string is '>', then `mak` is the last index `i` of the loop, otherwise `mak` is either 0 or the last index `i` of the loop, the current value of the input string is either '>' or unchanged, and this is printed: '!' followed by the value of `mak2`, and the value of `pans[mak]`, and '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is either 0, 1, or 2, the value of `mak` which is either 0, 1, or 2, the value of `i` which is 2, and the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed. If the input string is '<', then the current value of the input string is '<', otherwise it is unchanged. '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is either 0, 1, or 2, the value of `mak` which is either 0, 1, or 2, the value of `i` which is 2, and the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than 3, `mak` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `i` is 3, `s` is the input string, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` such that the input string is '=' at iteration `i`, `mak2` is the largest index `i` such that the input string is '<' at iteration `i`, the output buffer has been flushed six times, '?' followed by the value of `mak`, the value of `mak2`, the value of `i` which is `n`, and the value of `mak2` has been printed, and this is printed: '?' followed by the first element of the list `pans`, the first element of the list `pans`, the last element of the list `pans`, the last element of the list `pans`, and for each iteration of the loop, if the current value of the input string is '>', then `mak` is the last index `i` of the loop, otherwise `mak` is either 0 or the last index `i` of the loop, the current value of the input string is either '>' or unchanged, and this is printed: '!' followed by the value of `mak2`, and the value of `pans[mak]`, and '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is either 0, 1, or 2, the value of `mak` which is either 0, 1, or 2, the value of `i` which is 3, and the value of `i` which is 3 is being printed. If the input string is '<', then the current value of the input string is '<', otherwise it is unchanged. '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is either 0, 1, or 2, the value of `mak` which is either 0, 1, or 2, the value of `i` which is 3, and the value of `i` which is 3 is being printed. '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is either 0, 1, or 2, the value of `mak` which is either 0, 1, or 2, the value of `i` which is 3, and the value of `i` which is 3 is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
