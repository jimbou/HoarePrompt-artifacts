Postcondition: **`n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than 1, `mak` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `s` is the input string, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` such that the input string is '=' at iteration `i`, `mak2` is the largest index `i` such that the input string is '<' at iteration `i`, the output buffer has been flushed four times, '?' followed by the value of `mak`, the value of `mak2`, the value of `i` which is `n`, and the value of `mak2` has been printed, and this is printed: '?' followed by the first element of the list `pans`, the first element of the list `pans`, the last element of the list `pans`, the last element of the list `pans`, and for each iteration of the loop, if the current value of the input string is '>', then `mak` is the last index `i` of the loop, otherwise `mak` is either 0 or the last index `i` of the loop, the current value of the input string is either '>' or unchanged, and this is printed: '!' followed by the value of `mak2`, and the value of `pans[mak]`, and '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is either 0 or 1, the value of `mak` which is either 0 or 1, the value of `i` which is 1, and the value of `i` which is 1 is being printed. If the input string is '<', then the current value of the input string is '<', otherwise it is unchanged.**
