Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value in the permutation, and then finds the index of the maximum value. The program also uses a list to store the indices of the maximum values, and then finds the index of the maximum value in the list.

The program first finds the maximum value in the permutation by comparing each pair of elements. It uses the `?` query to compare the bitwise OR of two elements, and then updates the `mak` variable to store the index of the maximum value.

Once the maximum value is found, the program finds the index of the maximum value in the permutation. It uses the `?` query to compare the bitwise OR of the maximum value and each element in the permutation, and then updates the `pans` list to store the indices of the maximum values.

Finally, the program finds the index of the maximum value in the `pans` list by comparing each pair of elements. It uses the `?` query to compare the bitwise OR of two elements, and then updates the `mak` variable to store the index of the maximum value.

The program then prints the `!` query with the index of the maximum value and the index of the maximum value in the `pans` list.

The program uses at most 3n queries, which is within the limit specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
