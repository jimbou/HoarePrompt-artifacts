Output State: **n is at least 1, i is 0, s is a string containing the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is 0, and the value of mak2**

The first line, `sys.stdout.flush()`, does not affect any variables, but it ensures that the output buffer is cleared, making sure that any pending output is displayed immediately. The second line, `s = str(input())`, assigns the input string to the variable `s`. Since the input string contains the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`, the variable `s` now holds these values as a string. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
