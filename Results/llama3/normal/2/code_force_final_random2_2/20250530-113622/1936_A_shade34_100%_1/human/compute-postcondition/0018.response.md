Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `_` is 0, the output ? 0 0 1 1 is flushed to the console, and the output ? 2 2 3 3 is flushed to the console. If the input string is '<', then `mak` is 2. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, and `_` remain unchanged. The output ? 0 0 1 1 and ? 2 2 3 3 are both flushed to the console, indicating that the `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been executed, causing the buffered output to be written to the console. The condition regarding the input string '<' and the value of `mak` remains the same, as the code snippet does not modify this condition.
