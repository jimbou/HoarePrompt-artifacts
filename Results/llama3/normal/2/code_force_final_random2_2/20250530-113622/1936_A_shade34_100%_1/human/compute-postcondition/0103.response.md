Output State: **n is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than 0, i is 0, mak is 0, s is '<', pans is a list containing 0, mak2 is 0, the output buffer has been flushed n+2 times, '?' followed by the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is n, and the value of mak2 has been printed, '?' followed by the first element of the list pans, the first element of the list pans, the last element of the list pans, the last element of the list pans, '?' followed by the value of mak which is 0, the value of mak2 which is 0, the value of i which is n, and the value of mak2 which is 0, '?' followed by the value of mak which is 0, the value of mak2 which is 0, the value of i which is n, and the value of mak2 which is 0.**

In this final state, the value of `mak` has been updated to 0, which is the current value of `i`. The list `pans` now contains a single element, which is also 0, the current value of `i`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
