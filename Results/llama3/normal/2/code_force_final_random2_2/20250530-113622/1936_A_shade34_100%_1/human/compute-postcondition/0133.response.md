Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, `mak` is equal to `n`, the output buffer has been flushed `n+n+1` times, `pans` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `index` is 1, and this is printed: '?' followed by the second element of the `pans` list (`pans[n]`), the second element of the `pans` list (`pans[n]`), the `n`th element of the `pans` list (`pans[n]`), and the `n`th element of the `pans` list (`pans[n]`). The current value of the input is '>'**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `mak` is now equal to `n`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
