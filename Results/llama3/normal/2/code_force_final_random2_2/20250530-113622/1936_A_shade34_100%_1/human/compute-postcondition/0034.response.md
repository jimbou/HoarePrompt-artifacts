To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is at least 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. Additionally, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

The states of the other variables, `s`, `mak`, and `pans`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `s` is unchanged, `mak` is unchanged, `pans` is unchanged**
