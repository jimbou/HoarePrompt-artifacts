Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is at least 1, i is n, _ is 0, mak2 is mak, pans is an empty list, and the output ? 0 0 1 1, ? 1 1 2 2, ..., ? mak mak n-1 n-1 are flushed to the console. If the input string is '<', then mak is n-1. Otherwise, mak is the largest index i such that the input string is '<' at iteration i.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    s = str(input())
    if s == '<':
        mak = i
        pans = [i]
    elif s == '=':
        pans.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is at least 1, i is 0, if s is '<', then mak is 0 and pans is [0]. If s is '=', then pans is a list containing the value 0. If s is neither '<' nor '=', then the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is at least 2, i is 1, s is the input string. If s is '<', then mak is 1, pans is [1], and the output is '?' followed by the unchanged value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is 1, and the value of mak2. If s is not '<', then mak remains unchanged, and the output is '?' followed by the unchanged value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is 1, and the value of mak2. Additionally, if s is '=', then pans is a list that contains the value of i which is 1; otherwise, pans remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is at least 3, i is 2, s is the input string, if s is '<', then mak is 2 and pans is [2], otherwise mak is 1 and pans is [1, 2] if s is '=', otherwise pans is [1] if s is '<' and s is not '=', otherwise pans is [2] if s is not '<' and s is '=', otherwise pans is unchanged, mak2 is unchanged, and '?' followed by the unchanged value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is 2, and the value of mak2 has been printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
