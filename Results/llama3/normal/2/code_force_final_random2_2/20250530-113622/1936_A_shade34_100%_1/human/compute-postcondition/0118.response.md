Based on the precondition, the print statement will print a string that includes the following values:

* '?' : a literal question mark character
* mak : the value of mak, which depends on the value of s. If s is '<', then mak is 1. If s is '=', then mak is 0. If s is not '=' or '<', then mak is 0.
* mak2 : the value of mak2, which is always 0.
* i : the value of i, which is 2.
* mak2 : the value of mak2, which is always 0.

Therefore, the output will be a string that includes the question mark, the value of mak (which depends on the value of s), the value of mak2 (which is always 0), the value of i (which is 2), and the value of mak2 (which is always 0).

Output: **? [mak] 0 2 0 (where [mak] is the value of mak, which depends on the value of s)**
