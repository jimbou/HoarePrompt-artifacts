To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 2, and `i` should be 1, as it is the starting value of the range.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty**
