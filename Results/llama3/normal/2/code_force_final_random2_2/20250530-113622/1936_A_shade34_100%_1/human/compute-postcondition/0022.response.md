Output State: **n is at least 1, i is n, _ is 0, mak2 is mak, pans is an empty list, and the output ? 0 0 1 1, ? 1 1 2 2, ..., ? mak mak n-1 n-1 are flushed to the console. If the input string is '<', then mak is n-1. Otherwise, mak is the largest index i such that the input string is '<' at iteration i.**

The code assigns the value of `mak` to `mak2`, creating a new variable `mak2` with the same value as `mak`. It also initializes an empty list `pans`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `_` remain unchanged. The output to the console remains the same as before the code execution. The relationship between `mak` and the input string also remains the same.
