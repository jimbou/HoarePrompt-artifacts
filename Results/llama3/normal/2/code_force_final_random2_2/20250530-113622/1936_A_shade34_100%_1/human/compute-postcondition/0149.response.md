Output: ** `n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is equal to `len(pans)`, `mak` is equal to `len(pans)-1` if the input is '>', otherwise `mak` is equal to `n`, the output buffer has been flushed `n+len(pans)` times, `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `index` is 1, and this is printed: '?' followed by the second element of the `pans` list (`pans[1]`), the second element of the `pans` list (`pans[1]`), the `n`th element of the `pans` list (`pans[n]`), and the `n`th element of the `pans` list (`pans[n]`). If the current value of the input is '>', then the current value of the input is '>'. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged, and this is printed: '!' followed by the value of `mak2` and the `mak`th element of the `pans` list (`pans[mak]`).**
