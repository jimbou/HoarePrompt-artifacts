Based on the precondition, the print statement will print a string that starts with '?' followed by the value of `mak`, then the value of `mak2` (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), then the value of `i` which is 1, and finally the value of `mak2` again.

The value of `mak` is not defined in the precondition, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can describe its value as "the value of `mak`".

The value of `mak2` is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input. If the input string `s` is '<', then `mak2` is n-1. If `s` is not '<', then `mak2` is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input.

The value of `i` is 1.

Therefore, the output will be a string that starts with '?' followed by the value of `mak`, then the value of `mak2` (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), then 1, and finally the value of `mak2` again.

Output: **? [the value of mak] [0 or n-1 depending on the input] 1 [0 or n-1 depending on the input]**
