Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `_` is 0, `mak` is 3, the output ? 0 0 1 1 is flushed to the console, and the output ? 2 2 3 3 is flushed to the console. If the input string is '<', then no changes are made.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still at least 3, the value of `i` is still 3, the value of `_` is still 0, and the value of `mak` is now 3. The output ? 0 0 1 1 and ? 2 2 3 3 are still flushed to the console. The condition that if the input string is '<', then `mak` is 2 is not applicable here because `mak` is now assigned the value of `i`, which is 3.
