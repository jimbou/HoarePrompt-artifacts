Output State: **n is at least 2, i is 1, pans is a list, index is 1, the output buffer has been flushed n+len(pans)+n+2 times, stdin contains no input, mak2 is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input, and '?' followed by the value of mak (which is not defined in the precondition), followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of i which is 1, followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of s (which is either '<' or not '<') has been printed. If the input string s is '<', then pans is [0] and mak2 is n-1. If s is not '<', then pans is either an empty list or a list containing 0 if s is '='.**

The first line flushes the output buffer, incrementing the total number of flushes by 1. The second line reads a string input from stdin and assigns it to the variable s. This input is either '<' or not '<', which affects the values of pans and mak2. If s is '<', pans becomes [0] and mak2 becomes n-1. If s is not '<', pans remains either an empty list or a list containing 0 if s is '='. The value of s is then printed, followed by the existing output. No other variables are affected.
