Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `s` is a string containing the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is 0, and the value of mak2. The string s is not equal to '<'. The current value of s is '=', `pans` is a list containing the value 0.**

In this output state, the value of `pans` has been updated to include the current value of `i`, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The string `s` still contains the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`, and its current value is still '='. The value of `n` is still at least 1, and the value of `i` is still 0.
