Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is 2, `mak` is equal to `n` if the input is not '>', otherwise `mak` is equal to `n+1`, the output buffer has been flushed `n+n+3` times, `pans` is a list that must have at least 4 elements, `index` is 1, and this is printed: '?' followed by the second element of the `pans` list (`pans[1]`), the second element of the `pans` list (`pans[1]`), the `n`th element of the `pans` list (`pans[n]`), and the `n`th element of the `pans` list (`pans[n]`). If the current value of the input is '>', then the current value of the input is '>'. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the output buffer has been flushed one more time, making it a total of `n+n+3` times. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
