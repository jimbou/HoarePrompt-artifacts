Output State: **n is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, i is equal to n, the output buffer has been flushed n+n times, '?' followed by the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is n, and the value of mak2 has been printed, '?' followed by the value of mak which is either 0 or the last index i of the loop, the value of mak2 which is 0, the value of i which is n, and the value of mak2 which is 0, '?' followed by the value of mak which is either 0 or the last index i of the loop, the value of mak2 which is 0, the value of i which is n, and the value of mak2 which is 0, '?' followed by the value of mak which is either 0 or the last index i of the loop, the value of mak2 which is 0, the value of i which is n-1, and the value of mak2 which is 0, '?' followed by the value of mak which is either 0 or the last index i of the loop, the value of mak2 which is 0, the value of i which is n-1, and the value of mak2 which is 0, and for each iteration of the loop, if the current value of the input string is '>', then mak is the last index i of the loop, otherwise mak is either 0 or the last index i of the loop, the current value of the input string is either '>' or unchanged, and this is printed: '!' followed by the value of mak2, and the value of pans[mak], and '?' followed by the value of mak which is either 0 or the last index i of the loop, the value of mak which is either 0 or the last index i of the loop, the value of i which is n-1, and the value of i which is n-1 is being printed. If the input string is '<', then the current value of the input string is '<', otherwise it is unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `n` remains the same as the input value and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
* The value of `i` is equal to `n`.
* The output buffer has been flushed `n+n` times.
* The values of `mak` and `mak2` are either 0 or the last index `i` of the loop, depending on the input string.
* The value of `pans` is a list containing the indices of the loop where the input string is '<' or '='.
* The value of `s` is a string containing the input value.
* The output buffer contains the printed values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `pans[mak]` for each iteration of the loop.
* If the input string is '<', then the current value of the input string is '<', otherwise it is unchanged.
