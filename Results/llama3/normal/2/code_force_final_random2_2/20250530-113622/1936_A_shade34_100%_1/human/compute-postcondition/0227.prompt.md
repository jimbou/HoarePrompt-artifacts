You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: an integer (the number of test cases) followed by a series of test cases. Each test case contains one integer (n) followed by a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        mak = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
            sys.stdout.flush()
            if str(input()) == '<':
                mak = i
        
        mak2 = mak
        
        pans = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
            sys.stdout.flush()
            s = str(input())
            if s == '<':
                mak = i
                pans = [i]
            elif s == '=':
                pans.append(i)
        
        mak = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(pans)):
            print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
            sys.stdout.flush()
            if str(input()) == '>':
                mak = i
        
        print('!', mak2, pans[mak])
        
        sys.stdout.flush()
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing, and the final output state is determined by the last iteration of the loop. The value of `n` is the number of test cases, `i` is `len(pans)-1`, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` such that the input string is '=' at iteration `i`, `mak2` is the largest index `i` such that the input string is '<' at iteration `i`, and `mak` is the index of the maximum value in `pans`. The output buffer has been flushed a total of `n+len(pans)+n+len(pans)+1` times. The final output is '!' followed by the value of `mak2` and the value of `pans[mak]`.

```

Return Postconditions: The loop has finished executing, and the final output state is determined by the last iteration of the loop. The value of `n` is the number of test cases, `i` is `len(pans)-1`, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` such that the input string is '=' at iteration `i`, `mak2` is the largest index `i` such that the input string is '<' at iteration `i`, and `mak` is the index of the maximum value in `pans`. The output buffer has been flushed a total of `n+len(pans)+n+len(pans)+1` times. The final output is '!' followed by the value of `mak2` and the value of `pans[mak]`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
