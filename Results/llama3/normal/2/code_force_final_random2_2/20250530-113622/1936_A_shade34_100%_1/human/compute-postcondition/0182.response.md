Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `pans` is a list containing 0, `index` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed `n+len(pans)+n+1` times, stdin contains no input, `mak2` is 0, '?' followed by the value of `mak` (which is not defined in the precondition), followed by the value of `mak2` (which is 0), followed by the value of `i` which is 0, followed by the value of `mak2` (which is 0) has been printed, `s` is a string containing the input, and `s` is not '<', and the current value of `s` is '='.**

In this output state, the value of `pans` has been updated to include the current value of `i`, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer has been flushed the same number of times as before, and the same output has been printed. The value of `s` is still '=' and `mak2` is still 0.
