Output State: **n is at least 2, i is 2, the output buffer has been flushed n+len(pans)+n+3 times, stdin contains no input, and '?' followed by the value of mak (which is either 1 if s is '<', or not defined if s is not '<'), followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of i which is 2, followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of s (which is either '<' or not '<') has been printed. If the input string s is '<', then pans is [1] and mak2 is n-1. If s is '=', then pans is a list containing 0 and 1. If s is not '<' and not '=', then pans is either an empty list or a list containing 0. and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of mak (which is either 1 if s is '<', or not defined if s is not '<'), followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of i which is 2, followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), s is the input string.**

The first line flushes the output buffer, incrementing the total number of flushes to n+len(pans)+n+3. The second line reads a string from stdin, assigning it to s. Since stdin initially contains no input, s will be an empty string. The values of n, i, pans, mak, and mak2 remain unchanged.
