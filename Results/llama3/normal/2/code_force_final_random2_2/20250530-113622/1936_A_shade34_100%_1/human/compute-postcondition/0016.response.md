The code prints a string containing a question mark, the value of `mak`, the value of `mak` again, the value of `i`, and the value of `i` again.

Since `mak` is 2 when the input string is '<', and no changes are made otherwise, we can't determine the exact value of `mak` without knowing the input string. However, we can describe its value based on the given condition.

The value of `i` is given as 3.

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 3 3 (where mak is 2 if the input string is '<', otherwise its value is not changed)**
