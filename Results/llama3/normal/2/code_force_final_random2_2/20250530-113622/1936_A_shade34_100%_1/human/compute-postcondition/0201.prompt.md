Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is at least n, i is n-1, pans is an empty list, index is 1, the output buffer has been flushed n+len(pans)+n times, stdin contains no input, mak2 is 0 if the input is not '<', otherwise mak2 is n-1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    s = str(input())
    if s == '<':
        mak = i
        pans = [i]
    elif s == '=':
        pans.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is at least 1, i is 0, pans is a list, index is 1, the output buffer has been flushed n+len(pans)+n+1 times, stdin contains no input, mak2 is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input, and '?' followed by the value of mak (which is not defined in the precondition), followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of i which is 0, followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input) has been printed. If the input string s is '<', then pans is [0] and mak2 is n-1. If s is not '<', then pans is either an empty list or a list containing 0 if s is '='.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is at least 2, i is 1, the output buffer has been flushed n+len(pans)+n+2 times, stdin contains no input, and '?' followed by the value of mak (which is either 1 if s is '<', or not defined if s is not '<'), followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of i which is 1, followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of s (which is either '<' or not '<') has been printed. If the input string s is '<', then pans is [1] and mak2 is n-1. If s is '=', then pans is a list containing 0 and 1. If s is not '<' and not '=', then pans is either an empty list or a list containing 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is at least 2, i is 2, the output buffer has been flushed n+len(pans)+n+3 times, stdin contains no input, and '?' followed by the value of mak (which is either 1 if s is '<', or not defined if s is not '<'), followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of i which is 2, followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of s (which is either '<' or not '<') has been printed. If the input string s is '<', then pans is [1, 2] and mak2 is n-1 and mak is 2. If s is '=', then pans is a list containing 0, 1, and 2. If s is not '<' and not '=', then pans is either a list containing 0 and 2 or a list containing only 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
