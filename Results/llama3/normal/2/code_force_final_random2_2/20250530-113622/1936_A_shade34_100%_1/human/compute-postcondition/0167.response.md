The code prints a string that starts with '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is either 2 or 0 depending on the input, followed by the value of `mak` again which is either 2 or 0, followed by the value of `i` which is 3, and finally followed by the value of `i` again which is 3.

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 3 3 (where mak is either 2 or 0 depending on the input)**
