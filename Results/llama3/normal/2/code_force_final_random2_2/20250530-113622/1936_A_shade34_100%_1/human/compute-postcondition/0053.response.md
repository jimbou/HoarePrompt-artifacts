Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `pans[mak]`: Since `mak` is 0, this will print the first element of the `pans` list, which is an index `i` such that the input string is '=' at iteration `i`.
* `pans[mak]`: This is the same as the previous one, printing the first element of the `pans` list again.
* `pans[i]`: Since `i` is `n-1`, this will print the last element of the `pans` list, which is an index `i` such that the input string is '=' at iteration `i`.
* `pans[i]`: This is the same as the previous one, printing the last element of the `pans` list again.

The `?` is a literal character that will be printed before the values.

Output: **? [first index i such that the input string is '=' at iteration i], [first index i such that the input string is '=' at iteration i], [last index i such that the input string is '=' at iteration i], [last index i such that the input string is '=' at iteration i]**
