Postcondition: ***n is at least 2, i is 1, s is the input string. If s is '<', then mak is 1, pans is [1], and the output is '?' followed by the unchanged value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is 1, and the value of mak2. If s is not '<', then mak remains unchanged, and the output is '?' followed by the unchanged value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is 1, and the value of mak2. Additionally, if s is '=', then pans is a list that contains the value of i which is 1; otherwise, pans remains unchanged.***
