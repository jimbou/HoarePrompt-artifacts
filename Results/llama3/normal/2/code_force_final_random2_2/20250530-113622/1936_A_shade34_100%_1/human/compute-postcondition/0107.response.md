Postcondition: **n is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than 0, i is 0, mak is 0, s is the input string. If s is '=', then pans is a list containing one element which is 0, mak2 is 0, the output buffer has been flushed n+2 times, '?' followed by the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is n, and the value of mak2 has been printed, '?' followed by the first element of the list pans which is 0, the first element of the list pans which is 0, the last element of the list pans which is 0, the last element of the list pans which is 0, '?' followed by the value of mak which is 0, the value of mak2 which is 0, the value of i which is n, and the value of mak2 which is 0, '?' followed by the value of mak which is 0, the value of mak2 which is 0, the value of i which is n, and the value of mak2 which is 0. Otherwise, pans is an empty list, mak2 is 0, the output buffer has been flushed n+2 times, '?' followed by the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is n, and the value of mak2 has been printed, '?' followed by the value of mak which is 0, the value of mak2 which is 0, the value of i which is n, and the value of mak2 which is 0, '?' followed by the value of mak which is 0, the value of mak2 which is 0, the value of i which is n, and the value of mak2 which is 0.**
