Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, the output buffer has been flushed `n+n+1` times, `pans` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `index` is 1, and this is printed: '?' followed by the second element of the `pans` list (`pans[mak]`), the second element of the `pans` list (`pans[mak]`), the `n`th element of the `pans` list (`pans[i]`), and the `n`th element of the `pans` list (`pans[i]`).**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, which means it forces the output to be displayed immediately. Since the output buffer has already been flushed `n+n` times, this additional flush increases the total number of flushes to `n+n+1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
