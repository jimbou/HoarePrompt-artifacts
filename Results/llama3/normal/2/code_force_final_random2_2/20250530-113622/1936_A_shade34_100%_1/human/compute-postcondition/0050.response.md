Output State: **n is at least n, i is n-1, s is the input string, if s is '<', then mak is n-1 and pans is [n-1], otherwise mak is the largest index i such that the input string is '<' at iteration i and pans is a list containing all indices i such that the input string is '=' at iteration i, mak2 is mak, and '?' followed by the unchanged value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is n-1, and the value of mak2 has been printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` remains the same, the value of `i` is now `n-1`, the value of `s` is the input string, and the values of `mak`, `pans`, and `mak2` depend on the input string. If the input string is '<', then `mak` is `n-1` and `pans` is a list containing only `n-1`. Otherwise, `mak` is the largest index `i` such that the input string is '<' at iteration `i`, and `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` such that the input string is '=' at iteration `i`. The value of `mak2` is the same as `mak`, and the output is '?' followed by the unchanged value of `mak`, the value of `mak2`, the value of `i` which is `n-1`, and the value of `mak2`.
