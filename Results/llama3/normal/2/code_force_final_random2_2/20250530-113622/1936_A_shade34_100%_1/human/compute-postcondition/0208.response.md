Output State: **`n` is at least n, `i` is 1, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to n-1 if s is '=', or a list containing all values from 0 to n-2 or a list containing all values from 1 to n-1 if s is not '<' and not '=', `index` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed n+len(pans)+n+n+1 times, stdin contains no input, `mak2` is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input, `mak` is 1, and '?' followed by the value of mak (which is 1), followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of i which is 1, followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of s (which is '>') has been printed, pans must have at least 2 elements, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of pans[mak] (which is pans[1]), followed by the value of pans[mak] (which is pans[1]), followed by the value of pans[i] (which is pans[1]), followed by the value of pans[i] (which is pans[1]).**

The value of `mak` is updated to be equal to the value of `i`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
