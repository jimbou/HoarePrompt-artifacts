Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

The print statement is: `print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])`

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the values:

* `pans[mak]`: The value of `mak` is either 0 or n-1, depending on the input. Since `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to n-1 (if s is '=') or a list containing all values from 0 to n-2 or a list containing all values from 1 to n-1 (if s is not '<' and not '='), the value of `pans[mak]` will be either the first element of the list (0) or the last element of the list (n-1).
* `pans[i]`: The value of `i` is 3. Since `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to n-1 (if s is '=') or a list containing all values from 0 to n-2 or a list containing all values from 1 to n-1 (if s is not '<' and not '='), the value of `pans[i]` will be the 4th element of the list (since indexing starts at 0). If n is at least 4, then `pans[i]` will be 3. If n is less than 4, then `pans[i]` will be out of range.

Considering these values, the print statement will output:

Output: **? [0 or n-1] [0 or n-1] [3 or out of range] [3 or out of range]**
