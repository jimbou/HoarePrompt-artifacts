Postcondition: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `index` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed `n+len(pans)+4` times, `stdin` contains no input. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 3 and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is 3, followed by the value of `mak` again which is 3, followed by the value of `i` which is 3, and finally followed by the value of `i` again which is 3. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0 and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is 0, followed by the value of `mak` again which is 0, followed by the value of `i` which is 3, and finally followed by the value of `i` again which is 3, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is either 0 or 3, followed by the value of `mak` again which is either 0 or 3, followed by the value of `i` which is 3, and finally followed by the value of `i` again which is 3.**
