Output: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `pans` is a list, `index` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed n+len(pans)+n+1 times, stdin contains no input, mak2 is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input, and '?' followed by the value of mak (which is not defined in the precondition), followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of i which is 1, followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input) has been printed. If the input string s is '<', then pans is [0] and mak2 is n-1. If s is not '<', then pans is either an empty list or a list containing 0 if s is '=' , and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of mak (which is not defined in the precondition), followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of i which is 1, followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input)**
