Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `s` is the input string, `mak` is 1 if `s` is '<', otherwise unchanged, `pans` is [1, 2] if `s` is '<', otherwise [2], `mak2` is unchanged, and '?' followed by the unchanged value of `mak`, the value of `mak2`, the value of `i` which is 2, and the value of `mak2` has been printed.**

In this output state, the value of `pans` has been updated to include the value of `i`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `mak` and `pans` depends on the input string `s`. If `s` is '<', then `mak` is 1 and `pans` is [1, 2]. Otherwise, `mak` is unchanged and `pans` is [2]. The value of `mak2` and the printed values remain the same.
