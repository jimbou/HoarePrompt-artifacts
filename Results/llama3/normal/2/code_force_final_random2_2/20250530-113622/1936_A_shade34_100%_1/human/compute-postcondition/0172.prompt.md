Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the new input value, mak is 0, i is equal to len(pans), pans is a list that must have at least len(pans) elements, index is 1, the output buffer has been flushed n+len(pans)+1 times, stdin contains no input
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '<':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `index` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed `n+len(pans)+2` times, `stdin` contains no input, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 1, otherwise `mak` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `index` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed `n+len(pans)+3` times, `stdin` contains no input, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 2 and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is 2, followed by the value of `mak` again which is 2, followed by the value of `i` which is 2, and finally followed by the value of `i` again which is 2. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0 and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is 0, followed by the value of `mak` again which is 0, followed by the value of `i` which is 2, and finally followed by the value of `i` again which is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `index` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed `n+len(pans)+4` times, `stdin` contains no input. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 3 and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is 3, followed by the value of `mak` again which is 3, followed by the value of `i` which is 3, and finally followed by the value of `i` again which is 3. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0 and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is 0, followed by the value of `mak` again which is 0, followed by the value of `i` which is 3, and finally followed by the value of `i` again which is 3, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is either 0 or 3, followed by the value of `mak` again which is either 0 or 3, followed by the value of `i` which is 3, and finally followed by the value of `i` again which is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
