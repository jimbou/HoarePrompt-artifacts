Postcondition: ***n is at least 1, i is 0, pans is an empty list, index is 1, the output buffer has been flushed n+len(pans)+n+1 times, stdin contains no input, mak2 is 0 if the input is not '<', otherwise mak2 is n-1, and '?' followed by the value of mak (which is not defined in the precondition), followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of i which is 0, followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input) has been printed, s is a string containing the input, and s is not '<', and the current value of s is '='***
