Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `index` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed `n+len(pans)+3` times, `stdin` contains no input, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, if the input is '<', then `mak` is 1, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` (which is either 0 or 1 depending on the input), followed by the value of `mak` again, followed by the value of `i` which is 2, and finally followed by the value of `i` again which is 2.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, which means that any buffered output is immediately written to the output. In this case, the output buffer has been flushed `n+len(pans)+2` times before, and now it is flushed one more time, making it `n+len(pans)+3` times. The values of the other variables remain the same, and the output remains the same as well.
