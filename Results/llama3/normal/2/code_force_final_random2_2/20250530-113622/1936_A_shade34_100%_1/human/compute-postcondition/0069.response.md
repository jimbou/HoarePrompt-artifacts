Output State: **`n` is at least n, `i` is 3, `s` is the input string, `pans` is a list containing all indices i such that the input string is '=' at iteration i and must have at least 4 elements, `mak2` is the largest index i such that the input string is '<' at iteration i, `mak` is 3, the value of mak2, the value of i which is n-1, and the value of mak2 has been printed, '?' followed by the value of mak, the value of mak, the value of i which is n-1, and the value of i which is n-1, and the output buffer has been flushed, and the output buffer has been flushed again, and the output buffer has been flushed again. If the current value of the input string is '>', then `mak` is 2, otherwise `mak` is either 0 or 1. The current value of the input string is either '>' or unchanged, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of mak, the value of mak, the value of i which is n-1, and the value of i which is n-1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `mak` has been updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
