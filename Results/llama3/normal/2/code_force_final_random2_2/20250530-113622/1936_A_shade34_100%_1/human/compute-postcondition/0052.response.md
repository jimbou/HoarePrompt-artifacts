To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `pans`. The loop will execute if `pans` has at least 2 elements, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to the length of `pans`. 

State: **`n` is at least n, `i` is 1, `s` is the input string, `mak` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all indices i such that the input string is '=' at iteration i and must have at least 2 elements, `mak2` is the largest index i such that the input string is '<' at iteration i, '?' followed by the unchanged value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is n-1, and the value of mak2 has been printed**
