Output State: **`n` is at least n, `i` is len(pans)-1, `s` is the input string, `pans` is a list containing all indices i such that the input string is '=' at iteration i, `mak2` is the largest index i such that the input string is '<' at iteration i, the output buffer has been flushed twice, '?' followed by the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is n-1, and the value of mak2 has been printed, and this is printed: '?' followed by the first element of the list pans, the first element of the list pans, the last element of the list pans, the last element of the list pans, and for each iteration of the loop, if the current value of the input string is '>', then `mak` is the last index i of the loop, otherwise `mak` is either 0 or the last index i of the loop, the current value of the input string is either '>' or unchanged, and this is printed: '!' followed by the value of mak2, and the value of pans[mak].**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the output buffer has been flushed twice. All variables maintain their previous values, and the same prints are still valid. The only change is that the output buffer has been flushed again.
