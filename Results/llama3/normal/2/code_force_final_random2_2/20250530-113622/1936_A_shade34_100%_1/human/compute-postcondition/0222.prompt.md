Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is at least n, `i` is n-1, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to n-1 if s is '=', or a list containing all values from 0 to n-2 or a list containing all values from 1 to n-1 if s is not '<' and not '=', `index` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed n+len(pans)+n+n times, stdin contains no input, `mak2` is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input, `mak` is 0, and '?' followed by the value of mak (which is 0), followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of i which is n-1, followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of s (which is either '<' or not '<') has been printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '>':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is at least n, `i` is 1, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to n-1 if s is '=', or a list containing all values from 0 to n-2 or a list containing all values from 1 to n-1 if s is not '<' and not '=', `index` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed n+len(pans)+n+n+1 times, stdin contains no input, `mak2` is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input, if the input is '>', then `mak` is 1 and '?' followed by the value of mak (which is 1), followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of i which is 1, followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of s (which is '>') has been printed, pans must have at least 2 elements, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of pans[mak] (which is pans[1]), followed by the value of pans[mak] (which is pans[1]), followed by the value of pans[i] (which is pans[1]), followed by the value of pans[i] (which is pans[1]). Otherwise, `mak` is 0 and '?' followed by the value of mak (which is 0), followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of i which is n-1, followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of s (which is either '<' or not '<') has been printed, pans must have at least 2 elements, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of pans[mak] (which is pans[0]), followed by the value of pans[mak] (which is pans[0]), followed by the value of pans[i] (which is pans[1]), followed by the value of pans[i] (which is pans[1]).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is at least n, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to n-1 if s is '=', or a list containing all values from 0 to n-2 or a list containing all values from 1 to n-1 if s is not '<' and not '=', `index` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed n+len(pans)+n+n+2 times, stdin contains no input, `mak2` is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input. If the input is '>', then `mak` is 2 and '?' followed by the value of mak (which is 2), followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of i which is 2, followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of s (which is '>') has been printed, pans must have at least 3 elements, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of pans[mak] (which is pans[2]), followed by the value of pans[mak] (which is pans[2]), followed by the value of pans[i] (which is pans[2]), followed by the value of pans[i] (which is pans[2]). Otherwise, `mak` is 2 and '?' followed by the value of mak (which is 2), followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of i which is n-1, followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of s (which is either '<' or not '<') has been printed, pans must have at least 3 elements, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of pans[mak] (which is pans[2]), followed by the value of pans[mak] (which is pans[2]), followed by the value of pans[i] (which is pans[2]), followed by the value of pans[i] (which is pans[2]), and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of pans[mak] (which is either pans[2] or pans[1]), followed by the value of pans[mak] (which is either pans[2] or pans[1]), followed by the value of pans[i] (which is pans[2]), followed by the value of pans[i] (which is pans[2]).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is at least n, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to n-1 if s is '=', or a list containing all values from 0 to n-2 or a list containing all values from 1 to n-1 if s is not '<' and not '=', `index` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed n+len(pans)+n+n+3 times, stdin contains no input. If the input is '>', then `mak` is 3 and this is printed: '?' followed by the 4th element of the list `pans` (pans[mak]) twice, followed by the 4th element of the list `pans` (pans[i]) twice. Otherwise, `mak` is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input, and this is printed: '?' followed by the 4th element of the list `pans` (pans[mak]) twice, followed by the 4th element of the list `pans` (pans[i]) twice.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
