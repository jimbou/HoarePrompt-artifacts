Output State: **`n` is at least n, `i` is 1, `s` is the input string, `mak` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all indices i such that the input string is '=' at iteration i and must have at least 2 elements, `mak2` is the largest index i such that the input string is '<' at iteration i, '?' followed by the unchanged value of mak which is 0, the value of mak2, the value of i which is n-1, and the value of mak2 has been printed, and this is printed: '?' followed by the first element of the list pans, the first element of the list pans, the last element of the list pans, the last element of the list pans, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the output buffer has been flushed, meaning that any pending output has been printed to the console. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
