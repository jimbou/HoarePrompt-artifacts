Output State: **n is at least 1, i is 0, pans is [0], index is 1, the output buffer has been flushed n+len(pans)+n+1 times, stdin contains no input, mak2 is n-1, mak is 0, s is a string containing the input '<'.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `mak`, making `mak` equal to 0. Then, it assigns a list containing the value of `i` to `pans`, making `pans` equal to [0]. No other variables are affected.
