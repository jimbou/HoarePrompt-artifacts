Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and uses the allowed queries to find the pair of indices i and j such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The program first finds the index `mak` that has the maximum value of `p_i` by comparing each index with the current maximum using the query `? mak mak i i`. This is done in O(n) queries.

2. Then, it finds all indices `pans` that have the same maximum value as `mak` by comparing each index with `mak` using the query `? mak mak2 i mak2`. This is done in O(n) queries.

3. Finally, it finds the index `mak` that has the maximum value of `p_i XOR p_j` among the indices in `pans` by comparing each pair of indices using the query `? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[i] pans[i]`. This is done in O(n) queries.

The program uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit. It also correctly finds the pair of indices i and j such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized.

Therefore, the program is correct and should work for all potential cases.
