Output State: **n is an integer equal to the input value, mak is 0, i is len(pans), s is the input string, pans is a list containing all indices i such that the input string is '=' at iteration i, mak2 is the largest index i such that the input string is '<' at iteration i, the output buffer has been flushed three times, '?' followed by the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is n, and the value of mak2 has been printed, and this is printed: '?' followed by the first element of the list pans, the first element of the list pans, the last element of the list pans, the last element of the list pans, and for each iteration of the loop, if the current value of the input string is '>', then `mak` is the last index i of the loop, otherwise `mak` is either 0 or the last index i of the loop, the current value of the input string is either '>' or unchanged, and this is printed: '!' followed by the value of mak2, and the value of pans[mak].**

Explanation:

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line initializes `mak` to 0. The rest of the code does not modify any variables, so the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of the new value of `n` and the initialized value of `mak`.
