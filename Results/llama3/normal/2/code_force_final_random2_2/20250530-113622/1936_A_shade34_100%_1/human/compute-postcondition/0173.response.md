Output State: **n is at least n, i is n-1, pans is an empty list, index is 1, the output buffer has been flushed n+len(pans)+n times, stdin contains no input, mak2 is 0 if the input is not '<', otherwise mak2 is n-1.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `mak` to `mak2`. Since `mak` is either 0 or `n-1` depending on the input, `mak2` will also be either 0 or `n-1`. The second line reinitializes the list `pans` to an empty list. 

The initial state of `n` being at least `n`, `i` being `n-1`, `index` being 1, the output buffer having been flushed `n+len(pans)+n` times, and `stdin` containing no input remains unchanged as these variables are not modified by the code.
