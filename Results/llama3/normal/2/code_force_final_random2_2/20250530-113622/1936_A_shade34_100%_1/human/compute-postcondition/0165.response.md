Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `index` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed `n+len(pans)+3` times, `stdin` contains no input, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 2 and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is 2, followed by the value of `mak` again which is 2, followed by the value of `i` which is 2, and finally followed by the value of `i` again which is 2. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0 and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is 0, followed by the value of `mak` again which is 0, followed by the value of `i` which is 2, and finally followed by the value of `i` again which is 2.***
