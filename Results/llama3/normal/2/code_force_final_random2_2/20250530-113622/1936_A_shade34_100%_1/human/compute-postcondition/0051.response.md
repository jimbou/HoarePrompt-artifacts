Output State: **n is at least n, i is n-1, s is the input string, mak is 0, pans is a list containing all indices i such that the input string is '=' at iteration i, mak2 is the largest index i such that the input string is '<' at iteration i, '?' followed by the unchanged value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is n-1, and the value of mak2 has been printed.**

In this output state, the value of mak has been updated to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The value of mak2 is still the largest index i such that the input string is '<' at iteration i, and the list pans still contains all indices i such that the input string is '=' at iteration i. The value of n, i, and s also remain the same. Additionally, the value of mak2, the value of i, and the value of mak2 have been printed, preceded by a '?' character.
