Output State: **`n` is at least n, `i` is 3, `s` is the input string, `pans` is a list containing all indices i such that the input string is '=' at iteration i and must have at least 4 elements, `mak2` is the largest index i such that the input string is '<' at iteration i, '?' followed by the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is n-1, and the value of mak2 has been printed, '?' followed by the first element of the list pans, the first element of the list pans, the last element of the list pans, the last element of the list pans, and the output buffer has been flushed, and the output buffer has been flushed again, and the output buffer has been flushed again. If the current value of the input string is '>', then `mak` is 2, otherwise `mak` is either 0 or 1. The current value of the input string is either '>' or unchanged, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of mak, the value of mak, the value of i which is n-1, and the value of i which is n-1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the output buffer has been flushed again. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `s`, `pans`, `mak2`, and `mak` remain the same, and the output buffer has been flushed three times. The current value of the input string is either '>' or unchanged, and the same values have been printed again.
