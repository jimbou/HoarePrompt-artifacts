Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required functionality of finding any two indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized, where ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation. The program iteratively queries the input to determine the maximum value and its index, and it flushes the output buffer after each query and after the final output. The program processes all test cases and produces a final output in the format '! <index> <value>'.

Correctness: **True**
