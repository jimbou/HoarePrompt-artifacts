To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables, such as `s`, `mak`, `pans`, `mak2`, and the output, are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution. Therefore, their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `s` is the input string, `mak` is 1 if `s` is '<', otherwise unchanged, `pans` is [1] if `s` is '<', otherwise unchanged, `mak2` is unchanged, output is '?' followed by the unchanged value of `mak`, the value of `mak2`, the value of `i` which is 2, and the value of `mak2`**
