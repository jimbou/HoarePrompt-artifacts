Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `index` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed `n+len(pans)+4` times, `stdin` contains no input, `mak` is 3, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If the input is '<', then this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is 3, followed by the value of `mak` again which is 3, followed by the value of `i` which is 3, and finally followed by the value of `i` again which is 3. Otherwise, this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is 3, followed by the value of `mak` again which is 3, followed by the value of `i` which is 3, and finally followed by the value of `i` again which is 3, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is 3, followed by the value of `mak` again which is 3, followed by the value of `i` which is 3, and finally followed by the value of `i` again which is 3.**

In natural language, the output state is that `mak` is now assigned the value of `i`, which is 3. The other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state. The output buffer has been flushed `n+len(pans)+4` times, and the specified strings have been printed.
