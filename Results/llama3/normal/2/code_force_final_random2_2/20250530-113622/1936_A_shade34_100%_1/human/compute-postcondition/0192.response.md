Postcondition: **n is at least 2, i is 1, the output buffer has been flushed n+len(pans)+n+2 times, stdin contains no input, and '?' followed by the value of mak (which is either 1 if s is '<', or not defined if s is not '<'), followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of i which is 1, followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the input), followed by the value of s (which is either '<' or not '<') has been printed. If the input string s is '<', then pans is [1] and mak2 is n-1. If s is '=', then pans is a list containing 0 and 1. If s is not '<' and not '=', then pans is either an empty list or a list containing 0.**
