Output State: **`n` is at least n, `i` is len(pans)-1, `s` is the input string, `pans` is a list containing all indices i such that the input string is '=' at iteration i, `mak2` is the largest index i such that the input string is '<' at iteration i, '?' followed by the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is n-1, and the value of mak2 has been printed, and this is printed: '?' followed by the first element of the list pans, the first element of the list pans, the last element of the list pans, the last element of the list pans, and the output buffer has been flushed, and this is printed for each iteration of the loop. If the current value of the input string is '>', then `mak` is the last index i of the loop, otherwise `mak` is either 0 or the last index i of the loop. The current value of the input string is either '>' or unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

* The value of `n` remains the same, which is at least `n`.
* The value of `i` is now the last index of the `pans` list, which is `len(pans)-1`.
* The value of `s` remains the same, which is the input string.
* The value of `pans` remains the same, which is a list containing all indices `i` such that the input string is '=' at iteration `i`.
* The value of `mak2` remains the same, which is the largest index `i` such that the input string is '<' at iteration `i`.
* The output buffer has been flushed for each iteration of the loop, and the value of `mak`, the value of `mak2`, the value of `i` which is `n-1`, and the value of `mak2` has been printed.
* The value of `mak` is either the last index `i` of the loop if the current value of the input string is '>', or either 0 or the last index `i` of the loop if the current value of the input string is not '>'.
* The current value of the input string is either '>' or unchanged.
