The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `arr` is a binary string of size `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' is a substring of `arr`, `results` is a list containing two strings 'no' or a list containing one string 'yes' and 'no' or a list containing two strings 'no'. If `arr` does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring of `arr`, and the count of '1's in `arr` is even, `results` is a list containing 'yes' and either two strings 'no' or one string 'no' or a list containing one string 'yes' and 'no' or a list containing two strings 'no'. If `arr` does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring of `arr`, and the count of '1's in `arr` is odd, `results` is a list containing one or more strings 'no'. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
