Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `arr` is a binary string of size `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The current value of the count of '1' in `arr` is an even number. Either `arr` does not contain exactly two '1' characters or '11' does not appear as a substring in `arr`. `results` is a list containing one string 'yes'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 0, `i` remains 0, and `n` is still an integer between 1 and 50. The string `arr` is still a binary string of size `n`. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by one. The count of '1' in `arr` is still an even number, and either `arr` does not contain exactly two '1' characters or '11' does not appear as a substring in `arr`. The list `results` now contains one string 'yes'.
