Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `arr` is a binary string of size `n`, `results` is a list containing one string 'no', stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the number of '1' characters in `arr` is odd.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 0, `i` remains 0, `n` is still an integer between 1 and 50, and `arr` is still a binary string of size `n`. The list `results` now contains one string 'no' because the condition for appending 'no' to `results` was met. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by one. The number of '1' characters in `arr` is still odd.
