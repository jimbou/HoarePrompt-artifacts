Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `arr` is a binary string of size `n`, `results` is a list containing one or more strings 'no', stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' is a substring of `arr`, `results` is a list containing two strings 'no' or a list containing one string 'yes' and 'no' or a list containing two strings 'no'. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `arr` remains the same as in the initial state. The `results` list now contains at least one 'no' string. The state of `results` is more specific than in the initial state, as it now contains at least one 'no' string. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one. The conditional statement about `arr` and `results` remains the same as in the initial state.
