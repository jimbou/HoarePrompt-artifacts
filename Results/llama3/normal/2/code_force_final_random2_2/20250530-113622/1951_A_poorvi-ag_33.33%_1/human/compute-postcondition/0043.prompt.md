Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is equal to 0, i is equal to t, n is an integer between 1 and 50, arr is a binary string of size n, stdin is empty. If arr contains exactly two '1's and '11' is a substring of arr, results is a list containing t strings 'no'. If arr does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring of arr, and the count of '1's in arr is even, results is a list containing t strings 'yes' and 'no'. If arr does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring of arr, and the count of '1's in arr is odd, results is a list containing t strings 'no'.
Code of the loop:
for r in results:
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `arr` is a binary string of size `n` that does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring of `arr`, and the count of '1's in `arr` is even, `results` is a list containing at least one string 'yes' or 'no', `r` is the first element in the list `results`, `stdin` is empty, and the first element in the list `results` which is `r` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `arr` is a binary string of size `n` that does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring of `arr`, and the count of '1's in `arr` is even, `results` is a list containing at least two strings 'yes' or 'no', `r` is the second element in the list `results`, `stdin` is empty, and the second element in the list `results` which is `r` is being printed, and 'yes' or 'no' is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `arr` is a binary string of size `n` that does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring of `arr`, and the count of '1's in `arr` is even, `results` is a list containing at least three strings 'yes' or 'no', `r` is the third element in the list `results`, `stdin` is empty, and the third element in the list `results` which is `r` is being printed, and 'yes' or 'no' is being printed, and the value of `r` which is either 'yes' or 'no' is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
