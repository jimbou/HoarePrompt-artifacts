Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `arr` is a binary string of size `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' is a substring of `arr`, `results` is a list containing two or more strings 'no'. If `arr` does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring of `arr`, and the count of '1's in `arr` is even, `results` is a list containing 'yes' and either two strings 'no', one string 'no', or a list containing one string 'yes' and 'no' or a list containing two strings 'no' and one more 'no'. If `arr` does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring of `arr`, and the count of '1's in `arr` is odd, `results` is a list containing two or more strings 'no'. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the code appends 'no' to the results list. The state of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `arr` remains unchanged. The results list is updated by adding one more 'no' to its current state. The conditions for the results list are also updated accordingly, with the addition of one more 'no' to the existing conditions.
