Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `results` is a list containing one string 'no', `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `arr` is a binary string of size `n` containing exactly two '1' characters and '11' appears as a substring in `arr`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `results` has been updated to include the string 'no', while the other variables remain unchanged. The size of `arr` is still `n`, and it still contains exactly two '1' characters with '11' as a substring. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by one.
