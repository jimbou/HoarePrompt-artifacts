Output State: **t is greater than 2, i is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 50, arr is a binary string of size n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If arr contains exactly two '1's and '11' is a substring of arr, results is a list containing two strings 'no' or a list containing one string 'yes' and 'no' or a list containing two strings 'no'. If arr does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring of arr, and the count of '1's in arr is even, results is a list containing 'yes' and either two strings 'no' or one string 'no' or a list containing one string 'yes' and 'no' or a list containing two strings 'no'. If arr does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring of arr, and the count of '1's in arr is odd, results is a list containing one or more strings 'no'. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

The code reads an integer n from stdin and assigns it to the variable n, and then reads a binary string of size n from stdin and assigns it to the variable arr. The state of the variables t and i remains unchanged. The state of the variable results depends on the values of arr and n. If arr contains exactly two '1's and '11' is a substring of arr, results is a list containing two strings 'no' or a list containing one string 'yes' and 'no' or a list containing two strings 'no'. If arr does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring of arr, and the count of '1's in arr is even, results is a list containing 'yes' and either two strings 'no' or one string 'no' or a list containing one string 'yes' and 'no' or a list containing two strings 'no'. If arr does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring of arr, and the count of '1's in arr is odd, results is a list containing one or more strings 'no'. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
