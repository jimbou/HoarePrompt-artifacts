Postcondition: ***t is greater than 1, i is 1, n is an integer between 1 and 50, arr is a binary string of size n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If arr contains exactly two '1's and '11' is a substring of arr, results is a list containing two strings 'no' or a list containing one string 'yes' and 'no' or a list containing two strings 'no'. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
