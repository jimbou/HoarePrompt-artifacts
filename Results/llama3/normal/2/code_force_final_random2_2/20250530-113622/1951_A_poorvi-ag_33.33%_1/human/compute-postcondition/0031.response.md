Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `arr` is a binary string of size `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' is a substring of `arr`, `results` is a list containing two or more strings 'no'. If `arr` does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring of `arr`, and the count of '1's in `arr` is even, `results` is a list containing 'yes' and either three strings 'no', two strings 'no', or a list containing one string 'yes' and two strings 'no' or a list containing three strings 'no'. If `arr` does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring of `arr`, and the count of '1's in `arr` is odd, `results` is a list containing two or more strings 'no'. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the code appends 'no' to the results list. The initial state conditions still hold, but the results list has been updated to include an additional 'no' string. The number of 'no' strings in the results list has increased by one, and the other variables remain unchanged.
