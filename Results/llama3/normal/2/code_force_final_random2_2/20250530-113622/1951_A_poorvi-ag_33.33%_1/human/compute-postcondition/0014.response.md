Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 50, arr is a binary string of size n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If arr contains exactly two '1' characters and '11' appears as a substring in arr, then results is a list containing two strings 'no'. If arr contains an even number of '1' characters but does not meet the previous condition, results is a list containing one string 'yes'. If arr contains an odd number of '1' characters, results is a list containing one string 'no'.***
