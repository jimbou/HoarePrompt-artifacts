The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `arr` is a binary string of size `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `results` is a list containing two strings 'no' or a list containing one string 'yes' or a list containing one string 'no'**
