Output State: **t is an integer equal to the number of test cases, results is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= n <= 50) and then a binary string of size n.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. So now stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The second line assigns an empty list to `results`. No other variables are affected.
