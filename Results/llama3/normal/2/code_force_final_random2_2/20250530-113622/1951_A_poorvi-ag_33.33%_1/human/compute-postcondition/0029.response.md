Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `arr` is a binary string of size `n`, `results` is a list containing one or more strings 'no' and one string 'yes', stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' is a substring of `arr`, the last element of `results` is 'yes'. If `arr` does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring of `arr`, and the count of '1's in `arr` is even, the last element of `results` is 'yes' and the rest of the elements are either two strings 'no' or one string 'no'. If `arr` does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring of `arr`, and the count of '1's in `arr` is odd, the last element of `results` is 'yes' and the rest of the elements are one or more strings 'no'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 2, `i` is still 2, `n` is still an integer between 1 and 50, and `arr` is still a binary string of size `n`. The list `results` now contains one or more strings 'no' and one string 'yes'. The last element of `results` is 'yes'. The rest of the elements of `results` depend on the values of `arr`. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' is a substring of `arr`, the last element of `results` is 'yes'. If `arr` does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring of `arr`, and the count of '1's in `arr` is even, the last element of `results` is 'yes' and the rest of the elements are either two strings 'no' or one string 'no'. If `arr` does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring of `arr`, and the count of '1's in `arr` is odd, the last element of `results` is 'yes' and the rest of the elements are one or more strings 'no'. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
