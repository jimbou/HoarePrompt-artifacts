Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `arr` is a binary string of size `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' is a substring of `arr`, `results` is a list containing two strings 'no' or a list containing one string 'yes' and 'no' or a list containing two strings 'no'. If `arr` does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring of `arr`, and the count of '1's in `arr` is even, `results` is a list containing 'yes' and either two strings 'no' or one string 'no' or a list containing one string 'yes' and 'no' or a list containing two strings 'no'. If `arr` does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring of `arr`, and the count of '1's in `arr` is odd, `results` is a list containing one or more strings 'no'. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
