Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a binary string of size n. It then checks each binary string to determine if it meets certain conditions. If the string contains exactly two '1's and '11' is a substring, it appends 'no' to the results list. If the string does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring, and the count of '1's is even, it appends 'yes' to the results list. If the string does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring, and the count of '1's is odd, it appends 'no' to the results list. Finally, it prints each result in the results list.**
