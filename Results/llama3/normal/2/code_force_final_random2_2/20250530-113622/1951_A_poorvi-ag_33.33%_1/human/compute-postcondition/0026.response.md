Output State: **t is greater than 2, i is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 50, arr is a binary string of size n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, results is a list containing one or more strings 'no'**.

In this output state, the values of t, i, n, and arr remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two. However, the results list now contains one or more strings 'no'. This is because the code appends 'no' to the results list, regardless of the previous state of the results list.
