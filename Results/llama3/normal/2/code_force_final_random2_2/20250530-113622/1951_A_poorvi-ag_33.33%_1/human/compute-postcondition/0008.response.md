The code appends the string 'no' to the list results. The value of the other variables are not affected. The size of results is increased by 1 and now contains two strings 'no'. The count of '1' in arr is still 2, and '11' still appears as a substring in arr. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one. The value of t, i and n are still the same.

Output State: **t is greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 50, arr is a binary string of size n, the current value of the count of '1' in arr is 2, and '11' appears as a substring in arr, results is a list containing two strings 'no', stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**
