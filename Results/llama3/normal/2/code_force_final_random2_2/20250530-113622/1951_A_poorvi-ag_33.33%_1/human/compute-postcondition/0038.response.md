The code prints the second element in the list `results` which is `r`. The list `results` contains at least two strings 'yes' or 'no'. Since the exact values in the list `results` are not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `r`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either 'yes' or 'no'.

Output: **'yes' or 'no' (where 'yes' or 'no' are the second element in the list results)**
