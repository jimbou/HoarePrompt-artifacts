Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `arr` is a binary string of size `n`, `results` is a list containing 'yes' and either two strings 'no' or one string 'no' or a list containing one string 'yes' and 'no' or a list containing two strings 'no', stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `results` has been updated to include the string 'yes'. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one. The state of `results` is more specific now, as it is a list containing 'yes' and either two strings 'no' or one string 'no' or a list containing one string 'yes' and 'no' or a list containing two strings 'no'.
