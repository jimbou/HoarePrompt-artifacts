Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
There are 𝑛 lamps numbered 1 to 𝑛 lined up in a row, initially turned off. You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): Choose two non-adjacent† lamps that are currently turned off, then turn them on. Determine whether you can reach configuration 𝑠, where 𝑠𝑖=1 means the 𝑖-th lamp is turned on, and 𝑠𝑖=0 otherwise. † Only lamp 𝑖 and 𝑖+1 are adjacent for all 1≤𝑖<𝑛. Note that lamp 𝑛 and 1 are not adjacent when 𝑛≠2. Input: Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤1000) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer 𝑛 (1≤𝑛≤50) — the number of lamps. The second line of each test case contains a binary string 𝑠 of size 𝑛 — the final desired configuration. Output: For each test case, print on one line "YES" if we can reach the configuration 𝑠 via applying the given operation any number of times. Otherwise, print "NO".

# Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr:
            results.append('no')
        if arr.count('1') % 2 == 0:
            if arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr:
                results.append('no')
            else:
                results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
    for r in results:
        print(r)





# Execution Summary:
This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a binary string of size n. It then checks each binary string to determine if it meets certain conditions. If the string contains exactly two '1's and '11' is a substring, it appends 'no' to the results list. If the string does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring, and the count of '1's is even, it appends 'yes' to the results list. If the string does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring, and the count of '1's is odd, it appends 'no' to the results list. Finally, it prints each result in the results list.
