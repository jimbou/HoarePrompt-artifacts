Output State: **t is equal to 0, i is equal to t, n is an integer between 1 and 50, arr is a binary string of size n, stdin is empty. If arr contains exactly two '1's and '11' is a substring of arr, results is a list containing t strings 'no'. If arr does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring of arr, and the count of '1's in arr is even, results is a list containing t strings 'yes' and 'no'. If arr does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring of arr, and the count of '1's in arr is odd, results is a list containing t strings 'no'.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be equal to 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variable `i` will be equal to `t`, which means that the loop has executed `t` times. The variable `n` will still be an integer between 1 and 50, and `arr` will still be a binary string of size `n`. The standard input `stdin` will be empty, indicating that all test cases have been read. The `results` list will contain `t` strings, where each string is either 'yes' or 'no', depending on the conditions specified in the loop. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' is a substring of `arr`, `results` will contain `t` strings 'no'. If `arr` does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring of `arr`, and the count of '1's in `arr` is even, `results` will contain `t` strings 'yes' and 'no'. If `arr` does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring of `arr`, and the count of '1's in `arr` is odd, `results` will contain `t` strings 'no'.
