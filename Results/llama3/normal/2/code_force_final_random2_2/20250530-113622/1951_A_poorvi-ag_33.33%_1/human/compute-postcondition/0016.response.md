Output State: **t is greater than 1, i is 1, n is an integer between 1 and 50, arr is a binary string of size n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, results is a list containing two strings 'no' or a list containing one string 'yes' or a list containing one string 'no'**

The code snippet reads an integer value from stdin and assigns it to `n`, and then reads a binary string of size `n` from stdin and assigns it to `arr`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one. The list `results` remains unchanged.
