Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether a given binary string can be reached by turning on non-adjacent lamps. The program checks for the following conditions:

1. If the string contains exactly two '1's and '11' is a substring, it returns 'no' because it is not possible to turn on two adjacent lamps.
2. If the count of '1's is even, it returns 'yes' because it is possible to turn on non-adjacent lamps in pairs.
3. If the count of '1's is odd, it returns 'no' because it is not possible to turn on non-adjacent lamps in pairs.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and returns the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
