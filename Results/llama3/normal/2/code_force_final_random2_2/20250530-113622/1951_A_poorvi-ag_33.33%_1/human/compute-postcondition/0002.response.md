The code reads two inputs from stdin: an integer `n` and a binary string `arr` of size `n`. The value of `n` is assigned to the variable `n`, and the binary string is assigned to the variable `arr`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `results` are not affected by the code.

Output State: **t is greater than 0, i is 0, results is an empty list, n is an integer between 1 and 50, arr is a binary string of size n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**
