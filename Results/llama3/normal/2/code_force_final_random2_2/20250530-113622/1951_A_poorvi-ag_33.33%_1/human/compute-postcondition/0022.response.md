Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `arr` is a binary string of size `n`, `results` is a list containing one or more strings 'no', stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' is a substring of `arr`, `results` is a list containing two strings 'no' or a list containing one string 'yes' and 'no' or a list containing two strings 'no'. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 1, `i` is still 1, `n` is still an integer between 1 and 50, and `arr` is still a binary string of size `n`. The list `results` now contains one more string 'no'. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by one. The condition for `arr` and `results` remains the same as before.
