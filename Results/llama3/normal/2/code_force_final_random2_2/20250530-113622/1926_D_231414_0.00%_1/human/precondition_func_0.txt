stdin contains a sequence of lines. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). Each of the following t lines contains n space-separated integers a_1, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j < 2^31). The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
