According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `data`. If `data` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `times` is greater than 0, `check` is 2147483647, `stdin` contains t-1 lines of integers, followed by t-1 lines of n space-separated integers a_1, ..., a_n, `n` is an integer, `data` is a list of integers, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is an integer. For the loop to be executed, `data` must have at least 1 element and `i` is the first element in the list.

State: **`times` is greater than 0, `check` is 2147483647, `stdin` contains t-1 lines of integers, followed by t-1 lines of n space-separated integers a_1, ..., a_n, `n` is an integer, `data` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is an integer, `i` is the first element in the list**
