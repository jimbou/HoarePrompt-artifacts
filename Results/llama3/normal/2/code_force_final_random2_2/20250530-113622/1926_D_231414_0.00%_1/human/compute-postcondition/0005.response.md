Postcondition: **`times` is greater than 0, `check` is 2147483647, `stdin` contains t-1 lines of integers, followed by t-1 lines of n space-separated integers a_1, ..., a_n, `n` is an integer, `data` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `dic` is a dictionary that contains the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `i` and `check` as a key, `ans` is an integer, `i` is the first element in the list, and the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `i` and `check` is present in `dic`.**
