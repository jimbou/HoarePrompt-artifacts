Output State: **times is greater than 0, check is 2147483647, stdin contains t-1 lines of integers, followed by t-1 lines of n space-separated integers a_1, ..., a_n, n is an integer, data is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, dic is a dictionary that contains the result of the bitwise XOR operation between i and check as a key, ans is an integer, i is the first element in the list, and the result of the bitwise XOR operation between i and check is present in dic, dic[s] is reduced by 1, ans is reduced by 1.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `dic[s]` and `ans`. The first line decrements the value of `dic[s]` by 1, and the second line decrements the value of `ans` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
