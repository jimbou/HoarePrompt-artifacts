The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `times`. Since the first line of stdin contains a single integer `t`, `times` becomes `t`. The second line assigns the value of `2 ** 31 - 1` to `check`. This value is a constant and does not depend on any variables. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **times is t, check is 2147483647, stdin contains t lines of integers, followed by t lines of n space-separated integers a_1, ..., a_n**
