The only variable in the loop head is `times`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `times`. If `times` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `times` is `t`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `times` is greater than 0.

State: **`times` is greater than 0, `check` is 2147483647, stdin contains t lines of integers, followed by t lines of n space-separated integers a_1, ..., a_n**
