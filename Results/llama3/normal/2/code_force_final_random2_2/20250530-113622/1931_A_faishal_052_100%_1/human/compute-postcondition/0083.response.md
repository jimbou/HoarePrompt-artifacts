Output State: **cases is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, i is 2, j is 2, stdin contains t-4 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), arr is a list containing the integers 1, 1, and 1 if lex < 28, a list containing the integers 1, 26, and 1 if lex >= 28 and lex < 52, or a list containing the integers 1, 26, and 1 if lex >= 52 and lex <= 78, and lex is an integer between -56 and 22 inclusive if lex < 28, between -55 and 24 inclusive if lex >= 28 and lex < 52, or between -53 and -3 inclusive if lex >= 52 and lex <= 78.**

In this output state, the value of cases, info, i, and j remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of stdin also remains the same as it is not modified by the code. The value of arr is modified by appending 1 to it, and its new value depends on the initial value of lex. If lex is less than 28, arr becomes a list containing the integers 1, 1, and 1. If lex is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, arr becomes a list containing the integers 1, 26, and 1. If lex is greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, arr becomes a list containing the integers 1, 26, and 1. The value of lex is also modified by subtracting 1 from it, and its new value depends on its initial value. If lex is less than 28, its new value is between -56 and 22 inclusive. If lex is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, its new value is between -55 and 24 inclusive. If lex is greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, its new value is between -53 and -3 inclusive.
