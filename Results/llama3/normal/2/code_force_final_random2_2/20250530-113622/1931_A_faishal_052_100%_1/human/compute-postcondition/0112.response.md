Output State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing t sorted lists of integers, each containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, `j` is 3, `arr` is a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, `temp` is a string containing three characters, where the first character is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][0] + 96`, the second character is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][1] + 96`, and the third character is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][2] + 96`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the state of the variables remains the same as the initial state, except for the variable `temp` which now contains a string of three characters. Each character in the string corresponds to the ASCII value of the elements in the list `info[i]` at indices 0, 1, and 2, respectively, plus 96. The variable `j` has reached its final value of 3, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
