Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is an empty list, stdin contains t integers n (3 <= n <= 78).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cases):
    arr = []
    lex = int(input())
    for j in range(2):
        if lex < 28:
            arr.append(1)
            lex = lex - 1
        elif lex < 52:
            arr.append(26)
            lex = lex - 26
        elif lex <= 78:
            arr.append(26)
            lex = lex - 26
    arr.append(lex)
    arr.sort()
    info.append(arr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers, i is 0, j is 2, stdin contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), arr is a list containing the integer 1 and lex, and possibly the integer 26, and lex is an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and lex, i is 1, j is 2, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), arr is a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and lex, and lex is an integer between -53 and 24 inclusive.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: cases is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers, a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and a sorted list containing the integers 1, 26, and an integer between -54 and 24 inclusive, i is 2, j is 0, stdin contains t-5 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), and arr is a list containing the sorted integers 1, 26, and an integer between -54 and 24 inclusive.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
