Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers, i is 1, j is 2, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), arr is a list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and lex is an integer between -53 and 24 inclusive, between -50 and 0 inclusive, or between -50 and -1 inclusive.**

The code appends the integer 26 to the list arr and then subtracts 26 from the integer lex. Since lex was initially between -27 and 50 inclusive, after subtracting 26, it becomes between -53 and 24 inclusive. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
