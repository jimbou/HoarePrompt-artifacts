Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers, i is 0, j is 2, stdin contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), arr is a list containing the integer 1 and lex, and possibly the integer 26, and lex is an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive.**

In this final state, the value of `cases` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code. The value of `info` is updated to include a new list containing the sorted elements of `arr`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The state of `stdin` remains the same as it was not modified by the code. The value of `arr` is updated to include the integer `lex` and possibly the integer 26, and the list is sorted in ascending order. The value of `lex` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code, but its range is updated to include the possibility of being between -25 and 77 inclusive.
