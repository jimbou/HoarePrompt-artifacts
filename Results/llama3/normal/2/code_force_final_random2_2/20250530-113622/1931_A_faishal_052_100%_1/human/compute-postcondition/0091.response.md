Output State: **cases is 0, info is a list containing t sorted lists of integers, each containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, i is t-1, j is 0, stdin is empty, and arr is a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable 'cases' has been decremented to 0, the list 'info' contains 't' number of sorted lists of integers, each list containing either 1, 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive. The loop variables 'i' and 'j' have reached their final values, 't-1' and 0 respectively. The input stream 'stdin' is empty as all input values have been processed. The list 'arr' contains a sorted list of integers, which includes either 1, 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive.
