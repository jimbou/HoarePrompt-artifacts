Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, j is 2. If lex was less than 28, lex is an integer between 0 and 76 inclusive and arr is a list containing the integer 1. If lex was between 28 and 51 inclusive, lex is an integer between -25 and 51 inclusive and arr is a list containing either 1 and 26, 26 and 26, or 26 and 26 and 1. If lex was 52 or more, lex is an integer between 1 and 77 inclusive and arr is a list containing the integer 1 and 26. If lex was not less than 28, an additional element 26 is appended to arr, regardless of whether lex was less than 52 or not.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the values of the variables have been updated accordingly. The value of `lex` has been decremented by 1 or 26 depending on its initial value, and the list `arr` has been appended with the appropriate values (1 or 26) based on the initial value of `lex`. The other variables, `cases`, `info`, `stdin`, and `i`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
