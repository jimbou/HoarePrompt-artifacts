Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers, i is 1, j is 2, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), arr is a list containing either the integer 1, or the integer 26, or both, and lex is an integer between -53 and 24 inclusive.**

In this output state, the value of cases remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The value of info also remains the same as it was not modified by the code. The values of i and j remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The stdin still contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78) as the code did not modify it. The list arr now contains either the integer 1, or the integer 26, or both, as the code appended 26 to it. The value of lex is now an integer between -53 and 24 inclusive, as the code subtracted 26 from it.
