Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers, i is 1, j is 1, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), arr is a list containing either the integer 1, a single element 26, or the integers 26 and 26, and lex is an integer between -26 and 26 inclusive, -24 and 25 inclusive, or 0 and 25 inclusive, respectively.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `cases` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. The `info` list also remains unchanged, containing a sorted list of integers. The values of `i` and `j` are still 1. The stdin still contains t-3 integers n, with 3 <= n <= 78.

The `arr` list has been modified. If `lex` was less than 28, `arr` now contains the integers 1 and 26. If `lex` was between 28 and 51 inclusive, `arr` now contains the single element 26 and another 26. If `lex` was between 52 and 77 inclusive, `arr` now contains the integers 26 and 26. If `lex` was 77 or more, the state of `arr` remains unchanged.

The value of `lex` has also been modified. If `lex` was less than 28, it is now an integer between -26 and 2 inclusive. If `lex` was between 28 and 51 inclusive, it is now an integer between -24 and 25 inclusive. If `lex` was between 52 and 77 inclusive, it is now an integer between 0 and 25 inclusive. If `lex` was 77 or more, its value remains unchanged.
