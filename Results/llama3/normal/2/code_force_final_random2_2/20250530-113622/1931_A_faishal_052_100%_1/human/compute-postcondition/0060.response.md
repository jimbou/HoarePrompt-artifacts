Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and lex, i is 1, j is 2, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), arr is a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and lex, and lex is an integer between -53 and 24 inclusive.**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line appends the value of `lex` to the list `arr`. The second line sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The third line appends the sorted list `arr` to the list `info`. 

After the execution of the code, the list `info` will contain an additional sorted list, which is the sorted version of `arr`. The list `arr` will be sorted in ascending order, and it will contain the value of `lex` in addition to its original values. The value of `lex` will remain unchanged. The values of `cases`, `i`, and `j` will not be affected by the code. The state of `stdin` will also remain unchanged.
