Postcondition: ***cases is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, i is 2, j is 2, stdin contains t-4 integers n (3 <= n <= 78). If lex < 52, then arr is a list containing the integers 1, 1, and 26, and lex is an integer between -81 and -3 inclusive. If lex >= 52, then if lex <= 78, arr is a list containing the integers 1 and 26, and lex is an integer between -52 and -2 inclusive if lex < 52, between 2 and 52 inclusive if lex >= 52 and lex <= 78. If lex > 78, then the values of cases, info, i, j, stdin, arr, and lex remain unchanged.***
