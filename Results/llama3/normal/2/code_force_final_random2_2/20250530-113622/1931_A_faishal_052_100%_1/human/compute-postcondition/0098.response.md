To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `j` and the implicit upper limit of the range (which is 3 in this case).

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2.

The upper limit of the range, 3, does not change.

The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `info`, `arr`, and `temp`) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is a list containing t sorted lists of integers, each containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, `j` is 2, `arr` is a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, `temp` is a string containing two characters, the first character is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][j] + 96` and the second character is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][j] + 96`.**
