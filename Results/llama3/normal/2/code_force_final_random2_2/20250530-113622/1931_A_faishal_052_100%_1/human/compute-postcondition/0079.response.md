Postcondition: ***cases is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, i is 2, j is 1, stdin contains t-4 integers n (3 <= n <= 78). If lex is less than or equal to 78, then arr is a list containing the integers 1 and 26, and lex is an integer between -52 and -2 inclusive. If lex is greater than 78, then the values of cases, info, i, j, stdin, arr, and lex remain unchanged.***
