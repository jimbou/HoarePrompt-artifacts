Output State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing t sorted lists of integers, each containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, `j` is 3, `arr` is a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[2][0] + 96`, the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[2][1] + 96`, and the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[2][2] + 96`.**

The loop has executed all its iterations, and the output state reflects the final values of the variables involved in the loop. The variable `j` has reached its final value of 3, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `temp` now contains a string with three characters, each corresponding to the ASCII value of the elements in the list `info[2]` plus 96. The other variables, `cases`, `i`, `info`, and `arr`, remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
