Output State: **cases is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, i is 2, j is 2, stdin contains t-4 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), arr is a list containing the integers 1 and 26, and lex is an integer between -52 and -2 inclusive if lex < 52, between 2 and 52 inclusive if lex >= 52 and lex <= 78, or remains an empty list if lex > 78.**

The code appends the integer 26 to the list `arr` and then subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`. The initial state of `arr` and `lex` depends on the value of `lex`. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` contains the integers 1 and 1, and `lex` is between -55 and 23. If `lex` is between 28 and 52, `arr` contains the integers 1 and 26, and `lex` is between -54 and 24 if `lex` is less than 28, or between 2 and 25 if `lex` is greater than or equal to 28. If `lex` is between 52 and 78, `arr` contains the integers 1 and 26, and `lex` is between -52 and -2. If `lex` is greater than 78, the values of `arr` and `lex` remain unchanged.

After executing the code, `arr` will contain the integers 1 and 26, and `lex` will be decreased by 26. The new value of `lex` will be between -52 and -2 if it was between 52 and 78, or between 2 and 52 if it was between -52 and -2. The values of `cases`, `info`, `i`, `j`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
