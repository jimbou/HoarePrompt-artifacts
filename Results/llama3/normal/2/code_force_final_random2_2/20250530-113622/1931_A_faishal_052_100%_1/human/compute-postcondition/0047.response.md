Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers, i is 1, j is 1, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), arr is a list containing either the integer 1, a single element 26, or the integers 1 and 26, and lex is an integer between -26 and 26 inclusive, or between 2 and 51 inclusive, or between 26 and 51 inclusive, or remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `cases` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `info` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.

The state of `arr` is modified by the code. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` contains the integer 1. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 inclusive, `arr` contains a single element 26. If `lex` is between 52 and 77 inclusive, `arr` contains the integers 1 and 26. If `lex` is 77 or more, the state of `arr` remains unchanged.

The state of `lex` is also modified by the code. If `lex` is less than 28, it becomes `lex - 26`. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 inclusive, it becomes `lex - 26`. If `lex` is between 52 and 77 inclusive, it becomes `lex - 26`. If `lex` is 77 or more, the state of `lex` remains unchanged.
