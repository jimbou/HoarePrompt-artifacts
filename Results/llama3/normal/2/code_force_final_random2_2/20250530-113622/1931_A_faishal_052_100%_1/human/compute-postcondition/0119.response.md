To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(3):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 3.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is less than 3, so for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1.

The new state of `j` is `j` is 3.

The other variables in the state, `cases`, `i`, `info`, `arr`, and `temp`, are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing t sorted lists of integers, each containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, `j` is 3, `arr` is a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[2][j] + 96`, where j is 3**
