Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is an empty list, stdin contains t integers n (3 <= n <= 78).**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `cases`. Since `t` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `cases` becomes an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. The second line initializes `info` as an empty list. No other variables are affected.
