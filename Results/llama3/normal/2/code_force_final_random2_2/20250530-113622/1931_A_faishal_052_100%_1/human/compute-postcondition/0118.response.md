Output State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing t sorted lists of integers, each containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, `j` is less than 3, `arr` is a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[2][j] + 96`, where j is less than 3.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[2][j] + 96`, where j is less than 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
