Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers, i is 1, j is 2, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), arr is an empty list, and lex is an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line, `arr = []`, assigns an empty list to the variable `arr`, effectively clearing its previous contents. The second line, `lex = int(input())`, reads an integer from the standard input (`stdin`) and assigns it to the variable `lex`. Since `lex` was previously an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, its new value will also be an integer, but its range is now determined by the input value.

The initial state mentioned that `stdin` contains `t-2` integers `n` (3 <= n <= 78). After the second line of the code executes, one integer is read from `stdin`, leaving `t-3` integers in `stdin`. The other variables, `cases`, `info`, `i`, and `j`, are not affected by the code and retain their initial values.
