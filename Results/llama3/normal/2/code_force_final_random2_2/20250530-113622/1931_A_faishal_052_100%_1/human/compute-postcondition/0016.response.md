Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, lex is an integer between 1 and 77 inclusive, j is 1, arr is a list containing the integer 1 if lex was between 2 and 27 inclusive, or a list containing the integers 26 and 1 if lex was between 28 and 78 inclusive.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `cases` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. The `info` list is still empty. The stdin still contains t-1 integers n, where 3 <= n <= 78. The value of `i` is still 0, and the value of `j` is still 1. The value of `lex` has been decremented by 1, so it is now an integer between 1 and 77 inclusive. The `arr` list has been modified: if `lex` was originally between 2 and 27 inclusive, `arr` now contains the integer 1; if `lex` was originally between 28 and 78 inclusive, `arr` now contains the integers 26 and 1.
