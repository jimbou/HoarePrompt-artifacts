The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2. However, since `j` is now equal to 2, the loop will not execute again. But since we are asked to provide the state at the start of the next iteration, we will provide the state as if the loop is about to execute again.
State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers, i is 1, j is 2, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78). If lex is less than 28, then arr is a list containing either the integer 1, or the integer 26, or both, and lex is an integer between -27 and 50 inclusive. If lex is 28 or more, then if lex is less than 52, then arr is a list containing either the integer 1, a single element 26, or the integers 1 and 26, and lex is an integer between -26 and 26 inclusive, between 2 and 51 inclusive, or between 26 and 51 inclusive. If lex is 52 or more, then if lex is less than or equal to 78, arr is a list containing either the integer 1, a single element 26, or the integers 26 and 26, and lex is an integer between -26 and 26 inclusive, -24 and 25 inclusive, or 0 and 25 inclusive, respectively. If lex is greater than 78, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
