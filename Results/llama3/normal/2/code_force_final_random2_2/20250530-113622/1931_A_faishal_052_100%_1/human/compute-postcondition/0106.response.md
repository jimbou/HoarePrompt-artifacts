Output State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing t sorted lists of integers, each containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, `j` is 0, `arr` is a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, `temp` is a string containing a single character, which is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][j] + 96`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `temp` has been updated to a string containing a single character, which is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of the first element of the second list in `info` (since `i` is 1 and `j` is 0) plus 96. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
