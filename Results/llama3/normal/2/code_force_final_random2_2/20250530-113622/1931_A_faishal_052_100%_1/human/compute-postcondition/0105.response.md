To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `j` in the loop head. Since the loop iterates over `range(3)`, we need to make sure that `j` is within this range.

State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing t sorted lists of integers, each containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, `j` is 0, `arr` is a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, `temp` is an empty string**
