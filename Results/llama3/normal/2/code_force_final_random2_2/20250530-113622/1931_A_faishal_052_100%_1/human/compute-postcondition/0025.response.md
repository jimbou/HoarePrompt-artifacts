Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, j is 2, lex is an integer between -24 and 52 inclusive if it was between 28 and 51 inclusive, or an integer between 2 and 52 inclusive if it was 52 or more, arr is a list containing the integer 1 if lex was less than 28, or a list containing either 1 and 26, 26 and 26, or 26 and 26 if lex was between 28 and 51 inclusive, or a list containing the integer 26 if lex was between 52 and 78 inclusive, with an additional element 26 appended to it.**

In this output state, the value of `lex` has been decremented by 26, and an additional element 26 has been appended to the list `arr`. The ranges of `lex` have been updated accordingly, and the list `arr` now contains an additional element 26. All other variables remain unchanged.
