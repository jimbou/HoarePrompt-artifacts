According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 3, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3. So for the loop to be executed  `j` must be less than 3. 
State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing t sorted lists of integers, each containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, `j` is less than 3, `arr` is a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, `temp` is an empty string, and the previously printed string containing three characters, where the first character is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][0] + 96`, the second character is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][1] + 96`, and the third character is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][2] + 96`, is no longer being printed.**
