To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `j` and the range `2`. The loop will execute as long as `2` is greater than 0, which is always true. Therefore, we only need to adjust the state of `j` to be 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, arr is an empty list, lex is an integer between 3 and 78 inclusive, j is 0**
