Postcondition: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `info` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), `i` is 0, `j` is 2. If `lex` was less than 28, `lex` is an integer between 0 and 76 inclusive and `arr` is a list containing the integer 1. If `lex` was between 28 and 51 inclusive, `lex` is an integer between -25 and 51 inclusive and `arr` is a list containing either 1 and 26, 26 and 26, or 26 and 26 and 1. If `lex` was 52 or more, `lex` is an integer between 1 and 77 inclusive and `arr` is a list containing the integer 1 and 26. If `lex` was not less than 28, an additional element 26 is appended to `arr`, regardless of whether `lex` was less than 52 or not.**
