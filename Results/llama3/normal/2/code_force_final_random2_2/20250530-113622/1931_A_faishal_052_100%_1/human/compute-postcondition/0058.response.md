Postcondition: ***cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers, i is 1, j is 2, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78). If lex is less than 28, arr is a list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and lex is an integer between -28 and 49 inclusive. If lex is 28 or more, then if lex is less than 52, arr is a list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and lex is an integer between -53 and 24 inclusive. If lex is 52 or more, then if lex is less than or equal to 78, arr is a list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and lex is an integer between -53 and 24 inclusive, between -50 and 0 inclusive, or between -50 and -1 inclusive. If lex is greater than 78, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
