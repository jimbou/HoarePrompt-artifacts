The only variable in the loop head is variable j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j. If j is less than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 0. For the loop to execute again, j must be increased by 1.
State: **cases is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, i is 2, j is 1, stdin contains t-4 integers n (3 <= n <= 78). If lex < 28, then arr is a list containing the integer 1, and lex is an integer between -54 and 24 inclusive. If lex >= 28, then if lex < 52, arr is a list containing the integer 26, and lex is an integer between 2 and 25 inclusive. If lex >= 52 and lex <= 78, then arr is a list containing the integer 26, and lex is an integer between 2 and 52 inclusive. If lex > 78, then arr remains an empty list.**
