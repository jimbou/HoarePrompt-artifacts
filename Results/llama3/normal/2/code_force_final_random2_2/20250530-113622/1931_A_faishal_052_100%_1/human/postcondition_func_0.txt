This function reads a series of integers from standard input, processes them into a specific format, and prints out a string of three characters for each integer. The function takes no parameters and returns no value. It reads an integer t, followed by t integers n, where each n is processed into a list of three integers. The function then converts each list of integers into a string of three characters, where each character corresponds to the ASCII value of the integer plus 96. The function prints out each string of three characters. The final state of the program is that the input has been processed and the resulting strings have been printed to the console.
