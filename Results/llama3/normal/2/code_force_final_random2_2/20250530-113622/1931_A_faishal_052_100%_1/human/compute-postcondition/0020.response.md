Postcondition: ***`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `info` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), `i` is 0, `j` is 1. If `lex` is less than 52, `lex` is an integer between -24 and 52 inclusive, and `arr` is a list containing either 1 and 26, 26 and 26, or 26 and 26. If `lex` is 52 or more, `lex` is an integer between 2 and 78 inclusive, and `arr` is a list containing the integer 1 if `lex` is less than 28, or a list containing the integer 26 if `lex` is between 28 and 51 inclusive, or a list containing a single element 26 if `lex` is between 52 and 78 inclusive.***
