Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is 55, the program outputs "czz", but the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded is actually "czx". The program does not correctly handle cases where the encoded word has a sum that is not a multiple of 26.

The issue lies in the way the program constructs the three-letter word. It first checks if the sum is less than 28, and if so, it appends 1 to the array. Then, it checks if the sum is less than 52, and if so, it appends 26 to the array. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting word is the lexicographically smallest possible.

A correct approach would be to iterate over all possible combinations of three letters that sum up to the encoded word, and then select the lexicographically smallest one.
