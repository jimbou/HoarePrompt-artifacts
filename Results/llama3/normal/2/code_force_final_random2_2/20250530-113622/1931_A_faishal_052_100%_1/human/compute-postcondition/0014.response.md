Postcondition: ***cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, lex is an integer between 2 and 78 inclusive, j is 0. If lex is less than 28, arr is a list containing the integer 1. If lex is between 28 and 51 inclusive, arr is a list containing the integer 26. If lex is between 52 and 78 inclusive, arr is a list containing a single element 26. Otherwise, arr is an empty list.***
