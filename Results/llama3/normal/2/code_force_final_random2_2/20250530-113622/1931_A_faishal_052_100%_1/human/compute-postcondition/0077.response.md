Output State: **cases is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, i is 2, j is 1, stdin contains t-4 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), arr is a list containing the integers 1 and 26, lex is an integer between -54 and 24 inclusive if lex < 28, between 2 and 25 inclusive if lex >= 28 and lex < 52, between 2 and 52 inclusive if lex >= 52 and lex <= 78, or remains an empty list if lex > 78.**

The code appends the integer 26 to the list `arr` and then subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`. This means that `arr` will now contain both 1 and 26, and `lex` will be reduced by 26. The value of `lex` will still be within the specified ranges, depending on its original value. All other variables remain unchanged.
