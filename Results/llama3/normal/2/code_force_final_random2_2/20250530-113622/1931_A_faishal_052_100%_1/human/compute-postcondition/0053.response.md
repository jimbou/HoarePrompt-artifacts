Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers, i is 1, j is 2, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), arr is a list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and lex is an integer between -28 and 49 inclusive.**

The code modifies the state of the variables `arr` and `lex`. The first line appends the integer 1 to the list `arr`, and the second line decrements the value of `lex` by 1. The value of `lex` is between -27 and 50 inclusive, so after decrementing, it becomes between -28 and 49 inclusive. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
