Postcondition: ***cases is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, i is 2, j is 0, stdin contains t-4 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), and lex is an integer between 28 and 25 inclusive, and lex is greater than or equal to 52. If lex is less than or equal to 78, then arr is a list containing the integer 26, and lex is an integer between 2 and 52 inclusive. Otherwise, arr remains an empty list.***
