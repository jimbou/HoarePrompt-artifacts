Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, j is 2, lex is an integer between 0 and 76 inclusive if lex is less than 28, lex is an integer between -25 and 51 inclusive if lex is between 28 and 51 inclusive, lex is an integer between 1 and 77 inclusive if lex is 52 or more, arr is a list containing the integer 1 if lex is less than 28, or a list containing either 1 and 26, 26 and 26, or 26 and 26 and 1 if lex is between 28 and 51 inclusive, or a list containing the integer 1 and 26 if lex is between 52 and 78 inclusive.**

The code modifies the state of `lex` and `arr`. The first line appends the value 1 to the list `arr`, and the second line decrements the value of `lex` by 1. The ranges of `lex` and the possible values of `arr` are updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.
