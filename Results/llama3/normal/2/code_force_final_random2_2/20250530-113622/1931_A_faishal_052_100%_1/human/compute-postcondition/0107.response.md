The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 3, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1.
State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing t sorted lists of integers, each containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, `j` is 1, `arr` is a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, `temp` is a string containing a single character, which is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][j] + 96`**
