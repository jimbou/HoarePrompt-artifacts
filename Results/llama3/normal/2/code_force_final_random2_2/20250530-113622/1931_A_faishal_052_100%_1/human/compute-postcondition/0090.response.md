Output State: **cases is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers, a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and a sorted list containing the integers 1, 26, and an integer between -54 and 24 inclusive, i is 2, j is 0, stdin contains t-5 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), and arr is a list containing the sorted integers 1, 26, and an integer between -54 and 24 inclusive.**

The code first appends the value of lex to the list arr. Since lex is an integer between -54 and 24 inclusive, the list arr now contains the integers 1, 26, and an integer between -54 and 24 inclusive. The second line sorts the list arr in ascending order. The third line appends the sorted list arr to the list info. The list info now contains a sorted list of integers, a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and a sorted list containing the integers 1, 26, and an integer between -54 and 24 inclusive. The values of cases, i, j, and stdin remain unchanged.
