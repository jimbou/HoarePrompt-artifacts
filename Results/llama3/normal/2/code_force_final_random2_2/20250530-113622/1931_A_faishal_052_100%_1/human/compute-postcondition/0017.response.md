Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, lex is an integer between -24 and 52 inclusive, j is 1, arr is a list containing either 1 and 26, 26 and 26, or 26 and 26.**

The code block modifies the values of `lex` and `arr`. The first line appends the integer 26 to the list `arr`, and the second line subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`. The initial value of `lex` is between 2 and 78 inclusive, so after subtracting 26, it becomes between -24 and 52 inclusive. The initial value of `arr` depends on the value of `lex`: if `lex` is less than 28, `arr` contains the integer 1; if `lex` is between 28 and 51 inclusive, `arr` contains the integer 26; if `lex` is between 52 and 78 inclusive, `arr` contains a single element 26; otherwise, `arr` is an empty list. After appending 26 to `arr`, it will contain either 1 and 26, 26 and 26, or 26 and 26. The other variables (`cases`, `info`, `stdin`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
