The `print(temp)` statement will print the string `temp`, which contains three characters. 

The first character of `temp` is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][0] + 96`. Since `i` is 0, `info[i][0]` is the first element of the first list in `info`. The first list in `info` contains either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive. However, the exact value of `info[i][0]` is not provided. 

The second character of `temp` is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][1] + 96`. Since `i` is 0, `info[i][1]` is the second element of the first list in `info`. The first list in `info` contains either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive. However, the exact value of `info[i][1]` is not provided.

The third character of `temp` is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][2] + 96`. Since `i` is 0, `info[i][2]` is the third element of the first list in `info`. The first list in `info` contains either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive. However, the exact value of `info[i][2]` is not provided.

Since the exact values of `info[i][0]`, `info[i][1]`, and `info[i][2]` are not provided, we can't determine the exact characters that will be printed. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output a string containing three characters, each corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][0] + 96`, `info[i][1] + 96`, and `info[i][2] + 96` respectively.

Output: **a string containing three characters, each corresponding to the ASCII value of info[i][0] + 96, info[i][1] + 96, and info[i][2] + 96 respectively (where info[i][0], info[i][1], and info[i][2] are the elements of the first list in info)**
