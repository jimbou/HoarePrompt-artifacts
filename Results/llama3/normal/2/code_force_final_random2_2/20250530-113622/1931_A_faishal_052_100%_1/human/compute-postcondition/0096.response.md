To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(3):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 3.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0. To execute the loop again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

The only object in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust its state.

State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is a list containing t sorted lists of integers, each containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, `j` is 1, `arr` is a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, `temp` is a string containing a single character, which is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][j] + 96`**
