Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers, i is 1, j is 2, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), arr is an empty list, and lex is an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex < 28:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    elif lex <= 78:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers, i is 1, j is less than 2, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78). If lex is less than 28, then arr is a list containing the integer 1, and lex is an integer between -26 and 26 inclusive. If lex is between 28 and 51 inclusive, then arr is a list containing a single element, 26, and lex is an integer between 2 and 51 inclusive. If lex is between 52 and 77 inclusive, then arr is a list containing the integer 26 and lex is an integer between 26 and 51 inclusive. If lex is 77 or more, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers, i is 1, j is 1, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78). If lex is less than 28, then arr is a list containing either the integer 1, or the integer 26, or both, and lex is an integer between -27 and 50 inclusive. If lex is 28 or more, then if lex is less than 52, then arr is a list containing either the integer 1, a single element 26, or the integers 1 and 26, and lex is an integer between -26 and 26 inclusive, between 2 and 51 inclusive, or between 26 and 51 inclusive. If lex is 52 or more, then if lex is less than or equal to 78, arr is a list containing either the integer 1, a single element 26, or the integers 26 and 26, and lex is an integer between -26 and 26 inclusive, -24 and 25 inclusive, or 0 and 25 inclusive, respectively. If lex is greater than 78, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers, i is 1, j is 2, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78). If lex is less than 28, arr is a list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and lex is an integer between -28 and 49 inclusive. If lex is 28 or more, then if lex is less than 52, arr is a list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and lex is an integer between -53 and 24 inclusive. If lex is 52 or more, then if lex is less than or equal to 78, arr is a list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and lex is an integer between -53 and 24 inclusive, between -50 and 0 inclusive, or between -50 and -1 inclusive. If lex is greater than 78, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
