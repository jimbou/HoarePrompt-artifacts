To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the state of the variable `i` and `cases` according to the loop head.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `cases` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `cases`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, `i` should be 2 at the start of the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `cases` must be greater than 2.

State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and `lex`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `stdin` contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), `arr` is a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and `lex`, and `lex` is an integer between -53 and 24 inclusive.**
