Output State: **cases is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, i is 2, j is 2, stdin contains t-4 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), arr is a list containing the integers 1, 1, and 26, and lex is an integer between -81 and -3 inclusive.**

The code modifies the state of the program by appending the integer 26 to the list `arr` and subtracting 26 from the value of `lex`. The initial state of `arr` and `lex` depends on the value of `lex` before the code execution. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is a list containing the integers 1 and 1, and `lex` is an integer between -55 and 23 inclusive. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, `arr` is a list containing the integers 1 and 26, and `lex` is an integer between -54 and 24 inclusive if `lex` is less than 28, between 2 and 25 inclusive if `lex` is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, `arr` is a list containing the integers 1 and 26, and `lex` is an integer between -52 and -2 inclusive. If `lex` is greater than 78, the values of `cases`, `info`, `i`, `j`, `stdin`, `arr`, and `lex` remain unchanged.

After the code execution, `arr` becomes a list containing the integers 1, 1, and 26, and `lex` becomes an integer between -81 and -3 inclusive. The values of `cases`, `info`, `i`, `j`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
