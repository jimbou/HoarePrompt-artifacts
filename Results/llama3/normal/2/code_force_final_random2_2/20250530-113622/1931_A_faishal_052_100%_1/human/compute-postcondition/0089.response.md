Output State: **cases is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, i is 2, j is 0, stdin contains t-4 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), arr is a list containing the integers 1 and 26, and lex is an integer between -54 and 24 inclusive.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of j is reset to 0, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations. The values of cases, info, i, and stdin remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop head and body. The value of arr is a list containing the integers 1 and 26, indicating that the loop has executed at least twice. The value of lex is an integer between -54 and 24 inclusive, indicating that the loop has executed at least twice and lex has been decremented accordingly.
