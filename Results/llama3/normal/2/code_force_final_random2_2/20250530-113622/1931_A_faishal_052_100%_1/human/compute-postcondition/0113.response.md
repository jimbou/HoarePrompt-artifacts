Based on the precondition, the `print(temp)` statement will print the string `temp`, which contains three characters.

The first character of `temp` is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][0] + 96`. Since `i` is 1, `info[i][0]` refers to the first element of the second list in `info`. The second list in `info` contains either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive. Let's assume the first element of the second list is `x`. Then, the ASCII value of `x + 96` corresponds to a character. Since `x` is an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, the ASCII value of `x + 96` will be between 71 and 173 inclusive.

The second character of `temp` is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][1] + 96`. Similarly, the second element of the second list in `info` is `y`. Then, the ASCII value of `y + 96` corresponds to a character. Since `y` is an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, the ASCII value of `y + 96` will be between 71 and 173 inclusive.

The third character of `temp` is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][2] + 96`. Similarly, the third element of the second list in `info` is `z`. Then, the ASCII value of `z + 96` corresponds to a character. Since `z` is an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, the ASCII value of `z + 96` will be between 71 and 173 inclusive.

Therefore, the `print(temp)` statement will print a string containing three characters, where each character corresponds to the ASCII value of an integer between 71 and 173 inclusive.

Output: **a string containing three characters, where each character corresponds to the ASCII value of an integer between 71 and 173 inclusive**
