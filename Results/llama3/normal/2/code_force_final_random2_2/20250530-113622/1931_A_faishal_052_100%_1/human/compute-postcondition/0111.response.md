Output State: `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing t sorted lists of integers, each containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, `j` is 3, `arr` is a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, `temp` is a string containing three characters, where the first character is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][0] + 96`, the second character is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][1] + 96`, and the third character is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][2] + 96`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `cases` remains greater than 1, `i` remains 1, `info` remains a list of sorted lists of integers, `j` is now 3 (indicating the loop has completed), `arr` remains a sorted list of integers, and `temp` is a string of three characters, each corresponding to the ASCII value of the elements in the first three positions of the list `info[i]` plus 96.
