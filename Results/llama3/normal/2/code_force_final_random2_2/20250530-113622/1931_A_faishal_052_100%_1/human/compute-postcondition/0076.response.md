Output State: **cases is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, i is 2, j is 1, stdin contains t-4 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), arr is a list containing the integers 1 and 1, and lex is an integer between -55 and 23 inclusive.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been modified to include the integer 1, and the value of `lex` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The range of possible values for `lex` has also been updated to reflect the decrement operation.
