According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is 2, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is less than 2. The variable `j` is the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted.

State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers, i is 1, j is less than 2, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), arr is an empty list, and lex is an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive.**
