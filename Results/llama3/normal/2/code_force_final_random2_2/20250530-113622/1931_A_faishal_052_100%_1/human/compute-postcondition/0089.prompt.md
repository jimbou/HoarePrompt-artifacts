Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, i is 2, j is 2, stdin contains t-4 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), arr is an empty list, and lex is an integer between -53 and 25 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex < 28:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    elif lex <= 78:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *cases is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, i is 2, j is 0, stdin contains t-4 integers n (3 <= n <= 78). If lex < 28, then arr is a list containing the integer 1, and lex is an integer between -54 and 24 inclusive. If lex >= 28, then if lex < 52, arr is a list containing the integer 26, and lex is an integer between 2 and 25 inclusive. If lex >= 52 and lex <= 78, then arr is a list containing the integer 26, and lex is an integer between 2 and 52 inclusive. If lex > 78, then arr remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: cases is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, i is 2, j is 1, stdin contains t-4 integers n (3 <= n <= 78). If lex < 28, then arr is a list containing the integers 1 and 1, and lex is an integer between -55 and 23 inclusive. If lex >= 28, then if lex < 52, arr is a list containing the integers 1 and 26, and lex is an integer between -54 and 24 inclusive if lex < 28, between 2 and 25 inclusive if lex >= 28 and lex < 52, between 2 and 52 inclusive if lex >= 52 and lex <= 78, or remains an empty list if lex > 78. If lex >= 52, then if lex is less than or equal to 78, arr is a list containing the integers 1 and 26, and lex is an integer between -52 and -2 inclusive. If lex is greater than 78, then the values of cases, info, i, j, stdin, arr, and lex remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *cases is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, i is 2, j is 2, stdin contains t-4 integers n (3 <= n <= 78). If lex < 28, then arr is a list containing the integers 1, 1, and 1, and lex is an integer between -56 and 22 inclusive. If lex >= 28 and lex < 52, then arr is a list containing the integers 1, 26, and 1, and lex is an integer between -55 and 24 inclusive. If lex >= 52 and lex <= 78, then arr is a list containing the integers 1, 26, and 1, and lex is an integer between -53 and -3 inclusive. If lex > 78, then the values of cases, info, i, j, stdin, arr, and lex remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
