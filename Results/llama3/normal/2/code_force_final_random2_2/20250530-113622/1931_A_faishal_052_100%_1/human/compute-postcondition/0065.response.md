Output State: **cases is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, i is 2, j is 0, stdin contains t-5 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), arr is a list containing the integer 1, and lex is an integer between -54 and 24 inclusive.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the integer 1 to the list `arr`, which was initially empty. The second line decrements the value of `lex` by 1. Since the initial value of `lex` was between -53 and 25 inclusive and less than 28, the new value of `lex` will be between -54 and 24 inclusive. The remaining variables (`cases`, `info`, `i`, `j`, and `stdin`) are not affected by the code snippet.
