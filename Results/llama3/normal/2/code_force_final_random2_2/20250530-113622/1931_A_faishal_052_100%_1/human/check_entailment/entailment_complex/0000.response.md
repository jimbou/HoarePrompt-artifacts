Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded from a given integer.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` integers `n`, each representing an encoded word.
2. For each `n`, the program calculates the three-letter word by iterating through the possible values of the first two letters (1-26) and subtracting their values from `n`. The remaining value is the third letter.
3. The program sorts the three letters in ascending order to ensure that the lexicographically smallest word is generated.
4. The program converts each integer letter to its corresponding ASCII character by adding 96 (since 'a' has an ASCII value of 97).
5. The program prints the resulting three-letter word for each test case.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. The use of sorting to ensure the lexicographically smallest word is a nice touch.

Correctness: **True**
