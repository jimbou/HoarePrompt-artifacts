According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `cases`. If `i` is less than `cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `cases` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `cases` must be greater than 2.
State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing t sorted lists of integers, each containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, `j` is 3, `arr` is a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, `temp` is a string containing three characters, where the first character is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][0] + 96`, the second character is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][1] + 96`, and the third character is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][2] + 96`, and this string `temp` is being printed**
