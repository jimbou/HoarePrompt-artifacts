Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, lex is an integer between -24 and 52 inclusive, j is 1, arr is a list containing the integer 1 and 26 if lex is less than 28, or a list containing the integer 26 and 26 if lex is between 28 and 51 inclusive, or a list containing a single element 26 and 26 if lex is between 52 and 78 inclusive, or a list containing a single element 26 if lex is greater than 78.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `lex` and `arr`. The first line appends the integer 26 to the list `arr`, and the second line subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`. The value of `lex` is reduced by 26, and the list `arr` now contains an additional element, 26. The other variables remain unchanged.
