The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line initializes an empty list `arr`. The second line reads an integer from `stdin` and assigns it to the variable `lex`.

Since `lex` is assigned the value of an integer from `stdin`, the number of integers in `stdin` decreases by 1. The value of `lex` is now a specific integer between 3 and 78 inclusive.

The variables `cases`, `info`, and `i` are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, arr is an empty list, lex is an integer between 3 and 78 inclusive**
