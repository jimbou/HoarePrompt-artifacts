Postcondition: ***cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers, i is 1, j is 1, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78). If lex is less than 52, then arr is a list containing either the integer 1, a single element 26, or the integers 1 and 26, and lex is an integer between -26 and 26 inclusive, between 2 and 51 inclusive, or between 26 and 51 inclusive. If lex is 52 or more, then if lex is less than or equal to 78, arr is a list containing either the integer 1, a single element 26, or the integers 26 and 26, and lex is an integer between -26 and 26 inclusive, -24 and 25 inclusive, or 0 and 25 inclusive, respectively. If lex is greater than 78, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
