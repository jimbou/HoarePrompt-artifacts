Postcondition: ***cases is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, i is 2, j is 0, stdin contains t-4 integers n (3 <= n <= 78). If lex < 28, then arr is a list containing the integer 1, and lex is an integer between -54 and 24 inclusive. If lex >= 28, then if lex < 52, arr is a list containing the integer 26, and lex is an integer between 2 and 25 inclusive. If lex >= 52 and lex <= 78, then arr is a list containing the integer 26, and lex is an integer between 2 and 52 inclusive. If lex > 78, then arr remains an empty list.***
