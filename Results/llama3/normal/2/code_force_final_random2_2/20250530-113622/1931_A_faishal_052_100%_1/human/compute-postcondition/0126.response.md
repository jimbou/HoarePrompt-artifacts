Output State: **cases is equal to t, i is equal to t-1, j is 3, temp is a string containing three characters, where the first character is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of info[t-1][0] + 96, the second character is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of info[t-1][1] + 96, and the third character is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of info[t-1][2] + 96, and this string temp is being printed, and info is a list containing t sorted lists of integers, each containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, and arr is a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variables `i` and `j` have reached their final values. The variable `temp` contains the last string that was printed, which corresponds to the last list of integers in `info`. The variables `info` and `arr` remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the loop.
