Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is a list containing t sorted lists of integers, each containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, `j` is 0, `arr` is a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, `temp` is a string containing a single character, which is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][j] + 96`.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include a single character, which is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][j] + 96`. The ASCII value of `info[i][j] + 96` is calculated by adding 96 to the value of `info[i][j]`, which is an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive. The resulting ASCII value corresponds to a character, which is appended to the string `temp`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
