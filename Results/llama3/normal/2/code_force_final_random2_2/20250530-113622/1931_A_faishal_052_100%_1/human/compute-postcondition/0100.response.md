Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is a list containing t sorted lists of integers, each containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, `j` is 3, `arr` is a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, `temp` is a string containing three characters, the first character is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][0] + 96`, the second character is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][1] + 96`, and the third character is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][2] + 96`.**

The loop has executed all its iterations, and the output state reflects the final values of the variables. The variable `j` has reached its final value of 3, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `temp` now contains a string of three characters, each corresponding to the ASCII value of the elements in the first three positions of the list `info[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
