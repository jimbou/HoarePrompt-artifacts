Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers, i is 1, j is less than 2, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), arr is a list containing the integer 26, and lex is an integer between 26 and 51 inclusive.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the integer 26 to the list `arr`, which was initially empty. The second line subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`, which was initially between 52 and 77 inclusive. As a result, the value of `lex` is now between 26 and 51 inclusive. The other variables, `cases`, `info`, `i`, `j`, and `stdin`, remain unchanged.
