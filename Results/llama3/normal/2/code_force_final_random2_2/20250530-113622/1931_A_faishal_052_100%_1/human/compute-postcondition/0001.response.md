To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `cases`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `cases`. If `cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `info` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t integers n (3 <= n <= 78), `i` is 0**
