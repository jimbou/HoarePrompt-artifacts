Output State: **cases is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, i is 2, j is 1, stdin contains t-4 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), arr is a list containing the integers 1 and 26, and lex is an integer between -52 and -2 inclusive.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `cases` remains unchanged, still an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive. The `info` list also remains unchanged, containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both. The values of `i` and `j` are still 2 and 1, respectively. The `stdin` still contains t-4 integers n, where 3 <= n <= 78.

The `arr` list has been modified to contain both the integers 1 and 26. 

The value of `lex` has been decremented by 26, resulting in a new value between -52 and -2 inclusive.
