Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, arr is a list containing the integer 1, lex is an integer between 2 and 26 inclusive, j is 0**

The code block modifies the state of the variables as follows:

* The first line appends the integer 1 to the list `arr`, which was initially empty.
* The second line decrements the value of `lex` by 1. Since `lex` was initially an integer between 3 and 27 inclusive, its new value will be an integer between 2 and 26 inclusive.

All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `cases` is still an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `info` is still an empty list, `stdin` still contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), `i` is still 0, and `j` is still 0.
