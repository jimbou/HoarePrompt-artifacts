The only variable in the loop head is variable j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j. If j is less than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is less than 2. For the loop to execute again, j must be increased by 1. So, j is 1.
State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers, i is 1, j is 1, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78). If lex is less than 28, then arr is a list containing the integer 1, and lex is an integer between -26 and 26 inclusive. If lex is between 28 and 51 inclusive, then arr is a list containing a single element, 26, and lex is an integer between 2 and 51 inclusive. If lex is between 52 and 77 inclusive, then arr is a list containing the integer 26 and lex is an integer between 26 and 51 inclusive. If lex is 77 or more, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
