Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is a list containing t sorted lists of integers, each containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, `j` is 0, `arr` is a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and an integer between -25 and 77 inclusive, `temp` is an empty string**

The code assigns an empty string to the variable `temp`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The `stdin` is still empty. The output state includes all the information from the initial state, with the addition of the new variable `temp` being an empty string.
