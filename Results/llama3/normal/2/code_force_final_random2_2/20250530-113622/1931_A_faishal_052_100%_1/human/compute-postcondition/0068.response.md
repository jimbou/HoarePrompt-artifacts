Output State: **cases is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, i is 2, j is 0, stdin contains t-4 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), arr is a list containing the integer 26, and lex is an integer between 2 and 25 inclusive.**

The code appends the integer 26 to the list `arr`, which was initially empty. The value of `lex` is reduced by 26, resulting in a new value between 2 and 25 inclusive, since the initial value of `lex` was between 28 and 51 inclusive. All other variables remain unchanged.
