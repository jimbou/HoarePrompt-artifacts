Postcondition: ***cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers, i is 1, j is less than 2, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78). If lex is less than 28, then arr is a list containing the integer 1, and lex is an integer between -26 and 26 inclusive. If lex is between 28 and 51 inclusive, then arr is a list containing a single element, 26, and lex is an integer between 2 and 51 inclusive. If lex is between 52 and 77 inclusive, then arr is a list containing the integer 26 and lex is an integer between 26 and 51 inclusive. If lex is 77 or more, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
