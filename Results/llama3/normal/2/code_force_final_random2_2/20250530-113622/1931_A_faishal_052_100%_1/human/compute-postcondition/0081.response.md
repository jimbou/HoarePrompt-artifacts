Postcondition: **cases is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, i is 2, j is 1, stdin contains t-4 integers n (3 <= n <= 78). If lex < 28, then arr is a list containing the integers 1 and 1, and lex is an integer between -55 and 23 inclusive. If lex >= 28, then if lex < 52, arr is a list containing the integers 1 and 26, and lex is an integer between -54 and 24 inclusive if lex < 28, between 2 and 25 inclusive if lex >= 28 and lex < 52, between 2 and 52 inclusive if lex >= 52 and lex <= 78, or remains an empty list if lex > 78. If lex >= 52, then if lex is less than or equal to 78, arr is a list containing the integers 1 and 26, and lex is an integer between -52 and -2 inclusive. If lex is greater than 78, then the values of cases, info, i, j, stdin, arr, and lex remain unchanged.**
