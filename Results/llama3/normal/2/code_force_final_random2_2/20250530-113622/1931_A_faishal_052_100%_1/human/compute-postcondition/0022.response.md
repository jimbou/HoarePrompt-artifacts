To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(2):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 2.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. To execute the loop again, `j` must be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `info` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `lex` is an integer between 1 and 77 inclusive if `lex` is less than 28, `lex` is an integer between -24 and 52 inclusive if `lex` is between 28 and 51 inclusive, `lex` is an integer between 2 and 78 inclusive if `lex` is 52 or more, `arr` is a list containing the integer 1 if `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is a list containing either 1 and 26, 26 and 26, or 26 and 26 if `lex` is between 28 and 51 inclusive, `arr` is a list containing the integer 1 if `lex` is less than 28, or a list containing the integer 26 if `lex` is between 28 and 51 inclusive, or a list containing a single element 26 if `lex` is between 52 and 78 inclusive.**

Note that the states of `cases`, `info`, `stdin`, `i`, `lex`, and `arr` remain the same, as they are not involved in the loop head. Only the state of `j` is adjusted.
