Output State: **cases is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, i is 2, j is 2, stdin contains t-4 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), arr is an empty list, and lex is an integer between -53 and 25 inclusive.**

The code consists of two lines. The first line initializes an empty list `arr`. The second line reads an integer from `stdin` and assigns it to `lex`. Since `lex` was previously an integer between -53 and 24 inclusive, its new value will be an integer between -53 and 25 inclusive, as it can take on the value read from `stdin`. The value of `stdin` is reduced by one integer, as one integer is read and assigned to `lex`. The other variables remain unchanged.
