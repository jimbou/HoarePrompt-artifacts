Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, arr is a list containing a single element 26, lex is an integer between 26 and 52 inclusive, j is 0**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the value 26 to the list `arr`, which was initially empty. The second line subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`, which was initially between 52 and 78 inclusive. After the subtraction, the value of `lex` is between 26 and 52 inclusive. No other variables are affected by the code.
