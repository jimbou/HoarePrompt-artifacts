Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers, i is 1, j is 2, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), arr is a list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and lex is an integer between -53 and 24 inclusive.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will execute twice, and after each execution, the value of 'j' will be incremented by 1. 

In the first iteration, if 'lex' is less than 28, 'arr' will contain the integer 1, and 'lex' will be decremented by 1. If 'lex' is between 28 and 51 inclusive, 'arr' will contain the integer 26, and 'lex' will be decremented by 26. If 'lex' is between 52 and 78 inclusive, 'arr' will contain the integer 26, and 'lex' will be decremented by 26. If 'lex' is 78 or more, the state of the variables will remain unchanged.

In the second iteration, the same conditions will be applied again. If 'lex' is less than 28, 'arr' will contain either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and 'lex' will be decremented by 1. If 'lex' is between 28 and 51 inclusive, 'arr' will contain either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and 'lex' will be decremented by 26. If 'lex' is between 52 and 78 inclusive, 'arr' will contain either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and 'lex' will be decremented by 26. If 'lex' is 78 or more, the state of the variables will remain unchanged.

After the loop executes all the iterations, 'j' will be 2, 'arr' will contain either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, and 'lex' will be an integer between -53 and 24 inclusive. The state of the other variables will remain unchanged.
