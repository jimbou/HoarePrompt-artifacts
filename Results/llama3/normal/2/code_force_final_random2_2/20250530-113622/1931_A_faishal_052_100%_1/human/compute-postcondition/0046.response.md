Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers, i is 1, j is 1, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), arr is a list containing either the integer 1, or the integer 26, or both, and lex is an integer between -27 and 50 inclusive.**

In this output state, the value of cases, info, i, and j remains unchanged. The stdin still contains t-3 integers n. The list arr now contains either the integer 1, or the integer 26, or both, depending on the initial value of lex. The value of lex is decremented by 1, resulting in a value between -27 and 50 inclusive.
