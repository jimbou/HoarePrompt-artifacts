Output State: **cases is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, i is 2, j is 0, stdin contains t-5 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), arr is a list containing the integer 26, and lex is an integer between 2 and 52 inclusive.**

The code appends the integer 26 to the list `arr`, which was initially empty. This changes the state of `arr` to contain the single element 26. The second line subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`, which was initially between 28 and 25 inclusive and greater than or equal to 52. After the subtraction, `lex` becomes an integer between 2 and 52 inclusive. All other variables remain unchanged.
