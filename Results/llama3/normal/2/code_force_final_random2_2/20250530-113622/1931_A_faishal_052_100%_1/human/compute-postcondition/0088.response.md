Postcondition: ***cases is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing either the integer 1, the integer 26, or both, i is 2, j is 2, stdin contains t-4 integers n (3 <= n <= 78). If lex < 28, then arr is a list containing the integers 1, 1, and 1, and lex is an integer between -56 and 22 inclusive. If lex >= 28 and lex < 52, then arr is a list containing the integers 1, 26, and 1, and lex is an integer between -55 and 24 inclusive. If lex >= 52 and lex <= 78, then arr is a list containing the integers 1, 26, and 1, and lex is an integer between -53 and -3 inclusive. If lex > 78, then the values of cases, info, i, j, stdin, arr, and lex remain unchanged.***
