Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list of three elements: `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by two lists of integers `a` and `b`. `n` and `m` are positive integers, `k` is an even integer such that 2 <= `k` <= 2 * min(`n`, `m`). `a` and `b` are lists of integers such that 1 <= `a_i`, `b_j` <= 10^6. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, m, k, a, b in cases:
    unique_a = set(a)
    unique_b = set(b)
    relevant_a = {x for x in unique_a if x <= k}
    relevant_b = {x for x in unique_b if x <= k}
    only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b
    only_b = relevant_b - relevant_a
    both = relevant_a & relevant_b
    if len(only_a) > k // 2:
        results.append('NO')
        continue
    if len(only_b) > k // 2:
        results.append('NO')
        continue
    total_distinct = len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)
    if total_distinct < k:
        results.append('NO')
        continue
    results.append('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a non-empty list of test cases where each test case is a list of five elements: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `k` is an even integer such that 2 <= `k` <= 2 * min(`n`, `m`), `a` and `b` are lists of integers such that 1 <= `a_i`, `b_j` <= 10^6, `results` is a list containing the string 'NO' if the number of elements in `only_a` is more than `k` // 2, otherwise `results` is a list containing 'YES', `unique_a` is a set of unique elements from list `a`, `unique_b` is a set of unique elements from list `b`, `relevant_a` is a set of elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set of elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set of elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set of elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set of elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, and `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`. If the number of elements in `only_b` is more than `k` // 2, the current value of `only_b` has more than `k` // 2 elements. If the `total_distinct` is less than `k`, `results` has been appended with 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a non-empty list of test cases where each test case is a list of five elements: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `k` is an even integer such that 2 <= `k` <= 2 * min(`n`, `m`), `a` and `b` are lists of integers such that 1 <= `a_i`, `b_j` <= 10^6, `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, `unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set containing elements that are common to `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, `total_distinct` is an integer equal to len(`only_a`) + len(`only_b`) + len(`both`), and `results` is a list containing the string 'YES' for the last test case if `total_distinct` is not less than `k`, otherwise `results` is not updated.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a non-empty list of test cases where each test case is a list of five elements: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `k` is an even integer such that 2 <= `k` <= 2 * min(`n`, `m`), `a` and `b` are lists of integers such that 1 <= `a_i`, `b_j` <= 10^6, `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, `unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set containing elements that are common to `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, `total_distinct` is an integer equal to `len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)`, and `results` is a list containing the string 'YES' for the last test case.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
