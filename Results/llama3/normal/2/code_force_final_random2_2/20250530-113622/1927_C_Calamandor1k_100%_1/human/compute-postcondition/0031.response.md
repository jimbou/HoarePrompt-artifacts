Output State: **t is a positive integer, cases is a non-empty list of test cases where each test case is a list of five elements: n and m are positive integers, k is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= 2 * min(n, m), a and b are lists of integers such that 1 <= a_i, b_j <= 10^6, unique_a is a set containing unique elements from a, unique_b is a set containing unique elements from b, relevant_a is a set containing elements from unique_a that are less than or equal to k, relevant_b is a set containing elements from unique_b that are less than or equal to k, only_a is a set containing elements that are in relevant_a but not in relevant_b, only_b is a set containing elements that are in relevant_b but not in relevant_a, both is a set containing elements that are common to relevant_a and relevant_b, total_distinct is an integer equal to len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both), and results is a list containing the string 'NO' for the last test case if len(only_a) > k // 2 or len(only_b) > k // 2, otherwise results is not updated.**

The code snippet appends the string 'NO' to the results list for the last test case if the length of only_a is greater than k // 2 or the length of only_b is greater than k // 2. Otherwise, the results list remains unchanged. The continue statement skips the rest of the code in the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration. The initial state of the variables t, cases, and their respective elements remains unchanged.
