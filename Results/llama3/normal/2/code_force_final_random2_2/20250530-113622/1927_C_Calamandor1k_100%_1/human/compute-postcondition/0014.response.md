To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, which are derived from the `cases` list.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `cases` is a non-empty list of test cases. For the loop to execute again, `cases` must still be non-empty after removing the first test case that was processed in the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `cases` has at least one more test case. The other variables (`t`, `results`, `unique_a`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, `only_a`, `only_b`, `both`, and `total_distinct`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a non-empty list of test cases where each test case is a list of five elements: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `k` is an even integer such that 2 <= `k` <= 2 * min(`n`, `m`), `a` and `b` are lists of integers such that 1 <= `a_i`, `b_j` <= 10^6, `results` is a list, `unique_a` is a set, `unique_b` is a set, `relevant_a` is a set, `relevant_b` is a set, `only_a` is a set, `only_b` is a set, `both` is a set, and `total_distinct` is an integer**
