Output State: **t is a positive integer, cases is a non-empty list of test cases where each test case is a list of five elements: n and m are positive integers, k is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= 2 * min(n, m), a and b are lists of integers such that 1 <= a_i, b_j <= 10^6, unique_a is a set containing unique elements from a, unique_b is a set containing unique elements from b, relevant_a is a set containing elements from unique_a that are less than or equal to k, relevant_b is a set containing elements from unique_b that are less than or equal to k, only_a is a set containing elements that are in relevant_a but not in relevant_b, only_b is a set containing elements that are in relevant_b but not in relevant_a, both is a set containing elements that are common to relevant_a and relevant_b, total_distinct is an integer equal to len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both), and results is a list containing the string 'NO' for the last test case if len(only_a) > k // 2, otherwise results is not updated.**

The code snippet appends the string 'NO' to the results list and then skips to the next iteration of the loop using the continue statement. This means that the last test case will have 'NO' appended to the results list if the length of only_a is greater than k // 2. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
