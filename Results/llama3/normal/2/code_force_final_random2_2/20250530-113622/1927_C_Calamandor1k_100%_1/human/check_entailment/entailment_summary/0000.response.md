Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly k/2 elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1 to k is included. The program uses sets to efficiently find the unique elements in each array and the elements that are present in both arrays. It then checks if the total number of distinct elements is not less than k and if the number of elements that are only in one array does not exceed k/2. If these conditions are met, it outputs 'YES', otherwise it outputs 'NO'. The program handles all the test cases correctly and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
