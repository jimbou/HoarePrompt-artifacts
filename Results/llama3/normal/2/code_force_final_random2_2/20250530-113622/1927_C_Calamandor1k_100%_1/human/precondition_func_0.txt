t is a positive integer, cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list of three elements: n, m, and k, followed by two lists of integers a and b. n and m are positive integers, k is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= 2 * min(n, m). a and b are lists of integers such that 1 <= a_i, b_j <= 10^6.
