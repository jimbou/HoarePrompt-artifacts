Reasoning: The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly checks whether it is possible to choose exactly k/2 elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1 to k is included. The program uses sets to efficiently find the unique elements in each array and then checks the conditions specified in the problem description. The program correctly handles the cases where the total number of distinct elements is less than k, and where the number of elements that are only in one array is more than k/2. The program also correctly returns 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
