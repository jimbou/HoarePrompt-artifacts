Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, cases is a non-empty list of test cases where each test case is a list of five elements: n and m are positive integers, k is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= 2 * min(n, m), a and b are lists of integers such that 1 <= a_i, b_j <= 10^6, unique_a is a set containing unique elements from a, unique_b is a set containing unique elements from b, relevant_a is a set containing elements from unique_a that are less than or equal to k, relevant_b is a set containing elements from unique_b that are less than or equal to k, only_a is a set containing elements that are in relevant_a but not in relevant_b, only_b is a set containing elements that are in relevant_b but not in relevant_a, both is a set containing elements that are common to relevant_a and relevant_b, and total_distinct is an integer. If the number of elements in only_a is more than half of k, the results list contains the string 'NO'. If the number of elements in only_b is more than half of k, the results list contains the string 'NO'.***
