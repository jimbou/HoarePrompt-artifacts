Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list of three elements: `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by two lists of integers `a` and `b`. `n` and `m` are positive integers, `k` is an even integer such that 2 <= `k` <= 2 * min(`n`, `m`). `a` and `b` are lists of integers such that 1 <= `a_i`, `b_j` <= 10^6. `results` is an empty list.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer. The `cases` list remains unchanged, with each test case containing three elements: `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by two lists of integers `a` and `b`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers, `k` is an even integer within the specified range, and `a` and `b` are lists of integers within the specified range. A new variable `results` is introduced, which is an empty list.
