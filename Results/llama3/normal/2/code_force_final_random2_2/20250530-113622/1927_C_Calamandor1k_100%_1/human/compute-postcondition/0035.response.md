Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list of five elements: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `k` is an even integer such that 2 <= `k` <= 2 * min(`n`, `m`), `a` and `b` are lists of integers such that 1 <= `a_i`, `b_j` <= 10^6, `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, `unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set containing elements that are common to `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, `total_distinct` is an integer equal to `len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)`, and `results` is a list containing the string 'YES' for each test case where `total_distinct` is not less than `k`, otherwise `results` contains the string 'NO'.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `results` list will contain a string 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in the `cases` list. If the total number of distinct elements in the sets `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` is not less than `k` for a test case, the corresponding result will be 'YES', otherwise it will be 'NO'. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
