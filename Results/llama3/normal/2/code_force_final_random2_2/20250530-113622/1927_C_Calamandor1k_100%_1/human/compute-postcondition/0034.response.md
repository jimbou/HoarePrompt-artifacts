Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `cases` is an empty list of test cases, `results` is a list of strings where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO'. The values of `unique_a`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, `only_a`, `only_b`, `both`, and `total_distinct` are not defined.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list of test cases is empty, and the list of results contains a string for each test case that was processed. The string is 'YES' if the test case met the conditions, and 'NO' otherwise. The other variables that were used to process the test cases are no longer defined.
