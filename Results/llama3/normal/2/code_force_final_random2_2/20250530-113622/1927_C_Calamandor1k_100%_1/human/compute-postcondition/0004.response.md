Output State: **t is a positive integer, cases is a non-empty list of test cases where each test case is a list of five elements: n and m are positive integers, k is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= 2 * min(n, m), a and b are lists of integers such that 1 <= a_i, b_j <= 10^6, results is a list containing the string 'NO', unique_a is a set of unique elements from list a, unique_b is a set of unique elements from list b, relevant_a is a set of elements from unique_a that are less than or equal to k, relevant_b is a set of elements from unique_b that are less than or equal to k, only_a is a set of elements that are in relevant_a but not in relevant_b, only_b is a set of elements that are in relevant_b but not in relevant_a, both is a set of elements that are in both relevant_a and relevant_b, and the current value of only_a has more than k // 2 elements.**

In this output state, the value of t remains unchanged as a positive integer. The list of test cases, cases, also remains unchanged, with each test case containing the same elements as before. The lists a and b, as well as the sets unique_a, unique_b, relevant_a, relevant_b, only_a, only_b, and both, also retain their original values. The only change is the addition of the string 'NO' to the results list.
