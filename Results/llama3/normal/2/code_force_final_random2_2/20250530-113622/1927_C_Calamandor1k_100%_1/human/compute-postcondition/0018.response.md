Output State: **t is a positive integer, cases is a non-empty list of test cases where each test case is a list of five elements: n and m are positive integers, k is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= 2 * min(n, m), a and b are lists of integers such that 1 <= a_i, b_j <= 10^6, results is a list containing the string 'NO', unique_a is a set containing unique elements from a, unique_b is a set containing unique elements from b, relevant_a is a set containing elements from unique_a that are less than or equal to k, relevant_b is a set containing elements from unique_b that are less than or equal to k, only_a is a set containing elements that are in relevant_a but not in relevant_b, only_b is a set containing elements that are in relevant_b but not in relevant_a, both is a set containing elements that are common to relevant_a and relevant_b, and total_distinct is an integer.**

The code appends the string 'NO' to the results list and then skips to the next iteration of the loop using the continue statement. This means that the rest of the code inside the loop will be skipped, and the next test case will be processed. The values of t, cases, unique_a, unique_b, relevant_a, relevant_b, only_a, only_b, both, and total_distinct remain unchanged.
