Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, cases is a non-empty list of test cases where each test case is a list of five elements: n and m are positive integers, k is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= 2 * min(n, m), a and b are lists of integers such that 1 <= a_i, b_j <= 10^6, results is a list containing the string 'NO' if the number of elements in only_a is more than k // 2, otherwise results is an empty list, unique_a is a set of unique elements from list a, unique_b is a set of unique elements from list b, relevant_a is a set of elements from unique_a that are less than or equal to k, relevant_b is a set of elements from unique_b that are less than or equal to k, only_a is a set of elements that are in relevant_a but not in relevant_b, only_b is a set of elements that are in relevant_b but not in relevant_a, both is a set of elements that are in both relevant_a and relevant_b, and total_distinct is the sum of the lengths of only_a, only_b, and both. If the number of elements in only_b is more than k // 2, the current value of only_b has more than k // 2 elements. If the total_distinct is less than k, results has been appended with 'NO'.***
