Output State: **t is a positive integer, cases is a non-empty list of test cases where each test case is a list of five elements: n and m are positive integers, k is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= 2 * min(n, m), a and b are lists of integers such that 1 <= a_i, b_j <= 10^6, results is a list containing the string 'NO' if the number of elements in only_a is more than k // 2, otherwise results is an empty list, unique_a is a set of unique elements from list a, unique_b is a set of unique elements from list b, relevant_a is a set of elements from unique_a that are less than or equal to k, relevant_b is a set of elements from unique_b that are less than or equal to k, only_a is a set of elements that are in relevant_a but not in relevant_b, only_b is a set of elements that are in relevant_b but not in relevant_a, both is a set of elements that are in both relevant_a and relevant_b. The current value of only_b has more than k // 2 elements.**

The code appends 'NO' to the results list and then continues to the next iteration of the loop. This means that the current test case is skipped and the next test case is processed. The values of t, cases, n, m, k, a, b, unique_a, unique_b, relevant_a, relevant_b, only_a, only_b, and both remain unchanged. The only change is the addition of 'NO' to the results list.
