Functionality: **This function determines whether the total number of distinct elements in two sets, considering only elements up to a given even integer k, meets a certain condition for each test case. It accepts a list of test cases, where each case includes two sets of integers and an even integer k. The function returns a list of strings, where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether the total number of distinct elements in the sets is not less than k for each test case.**
