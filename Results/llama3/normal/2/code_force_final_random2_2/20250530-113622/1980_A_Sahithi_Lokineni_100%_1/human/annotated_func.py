#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) and a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G'.
    return 0
    #The program returns 0

#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not perform any actions or modify any input variables. It simply returns 0, indicating successful execution, without altering the state of the program or its inputs.
