Output: **n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, m is greater than 0, l is an empty list, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list, c is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list, _ is 0, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, x is the last integer in the original list. If a is greater than or equal to 2, the current value of s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1 minus the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index a - 2. Otherwise, the current value of s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1. The difference between b and a plus 1 is greater than 1, and s is greater than or equal to 2 times the difference between b and a plus 1. and 'YES' is printed**
