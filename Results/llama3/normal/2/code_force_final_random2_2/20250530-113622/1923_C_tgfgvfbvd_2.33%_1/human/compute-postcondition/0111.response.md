The only variable in the loop head is variable  _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than m, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, m is at least 2. For the loop to execute again _ must be 2 and m must be greater than 2.
State: **n is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, m is at least 3, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the list l, c is equal to the sum of all integers in the list l, _ is 2, a is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, x is the last integer in the list l. If a - 2 >= 0, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1 minus the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index a - 2. Otherwise, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
