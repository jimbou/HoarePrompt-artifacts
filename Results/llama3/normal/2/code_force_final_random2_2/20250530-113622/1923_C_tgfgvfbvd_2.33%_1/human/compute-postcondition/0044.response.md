To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again. The loop head is `for x in l:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `x` and `l`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `l` has at least one more integer. At the end of the previous iteration, `l` must have at least 1 integer, and `x` is the first integer in the list `l`. For the loop to execute again, `l` must have at least 2 integers, and `x` should be the second integer in the list `l`.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `m` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `l` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `p` is a list containing the value of `c`, `c` is the value of the first integer in the list `l`, `_` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index `b - 1`. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index `b - 1` minus the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index `a - 2`. Otherwise, no change is made to `s`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, `x` is the second integer in the list `l`**
