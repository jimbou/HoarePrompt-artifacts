The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and the input, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and the input. If `_` is less than the input, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, the input is an integer equal to the first integer from the input. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1.
State: **n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, m is 1, l is an empty list, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list, c is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list, _ is 1, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1. If a - 2 >= 0, then s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1 minus the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index a - 2. Otherwise, no change is made to s. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, x is the last integer in the original list.**
