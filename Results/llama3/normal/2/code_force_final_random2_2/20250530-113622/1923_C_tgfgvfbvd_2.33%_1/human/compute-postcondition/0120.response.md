Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, m is 0, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the list l, c is equal to the sum of all integers in the list l, _ is m, a is an integer equal to the last integer from the input, b is an integer equal to the last integer from the input, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1, x is the last integer in the list l. If a - 2 >= 0, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1 minus the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index a - 2. Otherwise, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `n` remains the same as the first integer from the input.
* The value of `m` becomes 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
* The list `l` and its cumulative sum `p` remain unchanged.
* The sum of all integers in the list `l` remains the same, stored in `c`.
* The variable `_` becomes equal to the initial value of `m`, which is the number of iterations the loop was supposed to execute.
* The values of `a` and `b` become the last integer from the input.
* The value of `s` is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index `b - 1`. If `a` is at least 2, `s` is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index `b - 1` minus the cumulative sum of all integers in the list `l` up to index `a - 2`.
* The value of `x` remains the last integer in the list `l`.
* The loop has printed either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration, depending on the conditions `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`.
