According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list l. If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, l has at least 1 element, x is the first integer in the list l. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the x is the second integer in the list.
State: **n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, m is 1, l is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, p is a list containing the value of c which is equal to the first integer in the list l, c is equal to the first integer in the list l, _ is 1, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1, x is the second integer in the list l**
