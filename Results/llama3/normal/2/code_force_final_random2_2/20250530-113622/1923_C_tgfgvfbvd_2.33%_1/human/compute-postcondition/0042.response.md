To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `l` (the list of integers) since it's the only object in the loop head. The loop will execute if `l` has at least one element.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `m` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `l` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 integer, `p` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `_` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index `b - 1`. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index `b - 1` minus the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index `a - 2`. Otherwise, no change is made to `s`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, `x` is the first integer in the list `l`**
