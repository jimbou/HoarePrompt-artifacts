The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `_` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again m must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 1, `l` is an empty list, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list, `c` is equal to the sum of all integers in the original list, `_` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index `b` - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 input: a space-separated list of integers. If `a` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index `a` - 2. If the current value of `b` minus `a` plus 1 is greater than 1 and the current value of `s` is greater than or equal to 2 times the value of `b` minus `a` plus 1, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, either (`b` - `a` + 1 is less than or equal to 1) or (`s` is less than 2 * (`b` - `a` + 1)), and 'NO' is printed.**
