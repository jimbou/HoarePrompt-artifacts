Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the conditions for a subarray to be considered "good" as per the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program calculates the cumulative sum of the array `c` and stores it in the array `p`. This is done to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray in constant time.

2. For each query, the program calculates the sum of the subarray `c[a:b]` by subtracting the cumulative sum at index `a-2` from the cumulative sum at index `b-1`. This is because the cumulative sum at index `i` includes the sum of all elements up to index `i`, so subtracting the cumulative sum at index `a-2` gives the sum of the subarray starting from index `a-1` to `b-1`.

3. The program then checks if the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray. This is the condition for a subarray to be considered "good" as per the problem description.

4. If the condition is met, the program prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles edge cases, such as when `a` is 1 (in which case `a-2` would be -1, which is out of bounds for the array `p`). In this case, the program simply doesn't subtract anything from the cumulative sum at index `b-1`, which is correct because the cumulative sum at index 0 includes the sum of all elements up to index 0.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
