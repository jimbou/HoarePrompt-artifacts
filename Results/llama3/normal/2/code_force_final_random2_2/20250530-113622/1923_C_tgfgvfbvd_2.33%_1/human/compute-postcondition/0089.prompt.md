Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, m is 1, l is a list of integers, p is an empty list, c is 0, _ is 1, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1. If a - 2 >= 0, then s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1 minus the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index a - 2. Otherwise, no change is made to s. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, x is the last integer in the original list.
Code of the loop:
for x in l:
    c += x
    p.append(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, m is 1, l is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, p is a list containing the value of c which is equal to the first integer in the list l, c is equal to the first integer in the list l, _ is 1, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1, x is the first integer in the list l.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, m is 1, l is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, p is a list containing the original value of c and the new value of c which is equal to the original value of c plus x, c is equal to the original value of c plus x, _ is 1, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1, x is the second integer in the list l

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, m is 1, l is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, p is a list containing the original value of c, the new value of c which is equal to the original value of c plus x, and the updated value of c which is equal to the original value of c plus 2x, c is equal to the original value of c plus 2x, _ is 1, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1, x is the third integer in the list l.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
