Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is greater than 0, l is an empty list, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list, c is equal to the sum of all integers in the original list, _ is 0, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 input: a space-separated list of integers. If a is greater than or equal to 2, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index a - 2. Either (b - a + 1 is less than or equal to 1) or (s is less than 2 * (b - a + 1))***
