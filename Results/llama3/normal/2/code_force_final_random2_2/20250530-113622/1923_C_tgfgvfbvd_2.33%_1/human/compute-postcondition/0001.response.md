Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers, p is an empty list, c is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated pair of integers and a space-separated list of integers**

The code snippet reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `m`, respectively. Then, it reads a space-separated list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `l`. The variable `p` is initialized as an empty list, and `c` is set to 0. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. After executing the code, stdin contains multiple test cases minus the two inputs that were read.
