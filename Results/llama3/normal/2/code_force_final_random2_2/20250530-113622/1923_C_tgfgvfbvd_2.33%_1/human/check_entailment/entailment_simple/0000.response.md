Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a given subarray is good according to the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the number of queries `m`, and the array `l` itself.

2. It then calculates the cumulative sum of the array `l` and stores it in the list `p`. This is done to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray in constant time.

3. For each query, it reads the left and right indices `a` and `b` of the subarray. It then calculates the sum `s` of the subarray by subtracting the cumulative sum up to `a-2` from the cumulative sum up to `b-1`. If `a` is 1, it simply takes the cumulative sum up to `b-1`.

4. The program then checks if the length of the subarray `b-a+1` is greater than 1 and if the sum `s` is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray. If both conditions are true, it prints 'YES', indicating that the subarray is good. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The logic is correct because a subarray is good if its sum is greater than or equal to twice its length. This is because we can construct a new array `b` by subtracting 1 from each element of the subarray, which will result in a sum that is twice the length of the subarray. Since the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to twice its length, we can always construct such a new array `b`.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
