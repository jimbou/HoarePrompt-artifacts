Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, m is 1, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the list l, c is equal to the sum of all integers in the list l, _ is 1, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1, x is the last integer in the list l.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    s = p[b - 1]
    if a - 2 >= 0:
        s -= p[a - 2]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, m is at least 1, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the list l, c is equal to the sum of all integers in the list l, _ is 0, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1, x is the last integer in the list l. If a is at least 2, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1 minus the cumulative sum of all integers in the list l up to index a - 2. If the difference between b and a plus 1 is greater than 1 and the current value of s is greater than or equal to twice the difference between b and a plus 1, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, either b - a + 1 is less than or equal to 1 or s is less than 2 * (b - a + 1), and 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, m is at least 2, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the list l, c is equal to the sum of all integers in the list l, _ is 1, a is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, x is the last integer in the list l. If a - 2 >= 0, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1 minus the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index a - 2. Otherwise, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, m is at least 3, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the list l, c is equal to the sum of all integers in the list l, _ is 2, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, x is the last integer in the list l. If a - 2 >= 0, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1 minus the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index a - 2. Otherwise, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
