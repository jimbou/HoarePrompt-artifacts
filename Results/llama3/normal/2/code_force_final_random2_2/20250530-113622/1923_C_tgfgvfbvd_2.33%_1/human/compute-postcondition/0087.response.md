To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `l`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is the second integer in the list `l`, and `l` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `l` must have at least 3 elements, and `x` should be the third integer in the list `l`.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `m` is 1, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `p` is a list containing the original value of `c` and the new value of `c` which is equal to the original value of `c` plus `x`, `c` is equal to the original value of `c` plus `x`, `_` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index `b - 1`, `x` is the third integer in the list `l`**
