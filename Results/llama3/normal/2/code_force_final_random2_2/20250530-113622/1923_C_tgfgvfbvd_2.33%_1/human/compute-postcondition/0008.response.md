Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, l is an empty list, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list, c is equal to the sum of all integers in the original list, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated pair of integers and a space-separated list of integers.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `l` will be empty because all its elements have been processed. The list `p` will contain the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list `l`. The variable `c` will hold the total sum of all integers in the original list `l`. The other variables `n`, `m`, and `_` remain unchanged, and the input from `stdin` remains the same.
