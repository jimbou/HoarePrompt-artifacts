Postcondition: **n is an integer, m is greater than 0, l is an empty list, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list, c is equal to the sum of all integers in the original list, _ is 2, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1. If a - 2 >= 0, then s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1 minus the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index a - 2. Otherwise, no change is made to s. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
