Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 1, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the list `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all integers in the list `l`, `_` is 0, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input and is at least 2, `b` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `s` is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index `b - 1` minus the cumulative sum of all integers in the list `l` up to index `a - 2`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `_`, `a`, `b`, and `x` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is in the value of `s`, which is now the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index `b - 1` minus the cumulative sum of all integers in the list `l` up to index `a - 2`.
