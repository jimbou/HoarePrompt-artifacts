Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `m` is greater than 0, `l` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list, `c` is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list, `_` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `b` is an integer equal to the third integer from the input, `x` is the last integer in the original list, `s` is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index `b - 1` minus the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index `a - 2`.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by subtracting the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index `a - 2` from its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
