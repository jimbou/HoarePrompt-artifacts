Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `l` is an empty list, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list, `c` is equal to the sum of all integers in the original list, `_` is 2, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index `b - 1` minus the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index `a - 2`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `_`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `s` is updated by subtracting the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index `a - 2` from its previous value. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.
