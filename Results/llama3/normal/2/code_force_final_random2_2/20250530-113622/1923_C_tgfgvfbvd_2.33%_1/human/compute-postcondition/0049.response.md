The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state of the other variables does not ensure that the loop will execute, so we need to adjust `m` to be greater than 0 and `_` to be 0.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is an empty list, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list, `c` is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list, `_` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index `b` - 1, `x` is the last integer in the original list**
