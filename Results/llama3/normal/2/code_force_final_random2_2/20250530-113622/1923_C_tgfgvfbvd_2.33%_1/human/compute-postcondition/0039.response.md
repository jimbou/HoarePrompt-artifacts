Output State: **n is an integer, m is 0, l is an empty list, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list, c is equal to the sum of all integers in the original list, _ is equal to the initial value of m, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1. If a - 2 >= 0, then s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1 minus the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index a - 2. Otherwise, no change is made to s. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop has finished executing, and the value of `_` is now equal to the initial value of `m`. The values of `n`, `l`, `p`, and `c` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input. The value of `s` is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index `b - 1`, minus the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index `a - 2` if `a - 2 >= 0`. The loop has printed either 'YES' or 'NO' for each pair of integers read from the input, depending on whether the condition `b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` was true or false.
