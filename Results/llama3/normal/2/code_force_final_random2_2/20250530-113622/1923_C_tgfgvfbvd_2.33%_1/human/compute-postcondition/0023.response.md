Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 1, `l` is an empty list, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list, `c` is equal to the sum of all integers in the original list, `_` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index `b - 1` minus the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index `a - 2`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by subtracting the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index `a - 2` from its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.
