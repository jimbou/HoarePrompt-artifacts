Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. 

The program first calculates the cumulative sum of the array `c` and stores it in the list `p`. Then, for each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray `c[a:b]` by subtracting the cumulative sum up to `a-2` from the cumulative sum up to `b-1`. 

The program then checks if the length of the subarray is greater than 1 and if the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. 

This logic is correct based on the problem description. The program correctly handles the edge case where `a` is 1 by not subtracting the cumulative sum up to `a-2` in that case. 

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
