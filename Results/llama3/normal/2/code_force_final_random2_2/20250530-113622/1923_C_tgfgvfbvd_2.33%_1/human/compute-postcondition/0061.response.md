The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than m, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, m is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again _ must be increased by 1.
State: **n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, m is greater than 1, l is an empty list, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list, c is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list, _ is 1, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, x is the last integer in the original list. If a is greater than or equal to 2, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1 minus the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index a - 2. Otherwise, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1. If the difference between b and a plus 1 is greater than 1 and s is greater than or equal to 2 times the difference between b and a plus 1, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
