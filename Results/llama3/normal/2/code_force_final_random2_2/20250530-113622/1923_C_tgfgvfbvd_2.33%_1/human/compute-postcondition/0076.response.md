Output: **n is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, m is greater than 0, l is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list, c is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list, _ is 2, a is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, b is an integer equal to the third integer from the input, x is the last integer in the original list. If a - 2 >= 0, then s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1 minus the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index a - 2. Otherwise, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1. and 'YES' is printed**
