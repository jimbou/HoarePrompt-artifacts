To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `m`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `_` is the loop variable, it should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is an empty list, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list, `c` is equal to the sum of all integers in the original list, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated pair of integers and a space-separated list of integers**
