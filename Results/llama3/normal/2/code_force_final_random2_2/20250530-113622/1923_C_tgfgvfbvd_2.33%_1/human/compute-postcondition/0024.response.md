Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is greater than 1, l is an empty list, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list, c is equal to the sum of all integers in the original list, _ is 1, a is an integer, b is an integer, if a - 2 >= 0, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1 minus the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index a - 2, otherwise s remains unchanged, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.***
