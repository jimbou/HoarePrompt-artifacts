To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `m`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `_` is the loop variable, it will take on the values from 0 to `m-1` during the loop iterations.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 1, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the list `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all integers in the list `l`, `_` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index `b - 1`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`**
