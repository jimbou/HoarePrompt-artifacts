According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `l` has at least 1 integer, `p` is a list containing the value of `c` which is equal to the first integer in the list, `c` is equal to the first integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and `x` is the second integer in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `p` is a list containing the value of `c` which is equal to the first integer in the list, `c` is equal to the first integer in the list, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated pair of integers and a space-separated list of integers, `x` is the second integer in the list**
