Output State: **n is an integer, m is greater than 0, l is an empty list, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list, c is equal to the sum of all integers in the original list, _ is 0, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 input: a space-separated list of integers**

The code reads a pair of integers from stdin and assigns them to `a` and `b`. It then calculates the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index `b - 1` and assigns it to `s`. The values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, and `_` remain unchanged. The only modifications are the addition of `a` and `b` as integers, and the calculation of `s` as the cumulative sum up to index `b - 1`. Stdin now contains one less input, which is a space-separated list of integers.
