The only object in the loop head is variable  x and list l, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list l.  If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, l has at least 2 integers, x is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the x is the third integer in the list.
State: **n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, m is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, l is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 3 integers, p is a list containing the original value of c and the new value of c which is the sum of the original value of c and the second integer in the list l, c is the sum of the original value of c and the second integer in the list l, _ is 1, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1. If a - 2 >= 0, then s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1 minus the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index a - 2. Otherwise, no change is made to s. x is the third integer in the list l.**
