Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, p is a list containing the value of c which is equal to the first integer in the list plus the third integer in the list, and the value of c after the execution, c is equal to the first integer in the list plus the third integer in the list plus the third integer in the list, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated pair of integers and a space-separated list of integers, x is the third integer in the list.**

The first line increments `c` by the value of `x`, which is the third integer in the list. Since `c` was initially equal to the first integer in the list plus the third integer in the list, it now becomes the first integer in the list plus the third integer in the list plus the third integer in the list. The second line appends the new value of `c` to the list `p`. No other variables are affected.
