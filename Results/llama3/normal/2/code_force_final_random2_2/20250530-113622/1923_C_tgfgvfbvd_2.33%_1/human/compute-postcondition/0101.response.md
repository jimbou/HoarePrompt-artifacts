Postcondition: ***n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, m is at least 1, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the list l, c is equal to the sum of all integers in the list l, _ is 0, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1, x is the last integer in the list l. If a is at least 2, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1 minus the cumulative sum of all integers in the list l up to index a - 2. If the difference between b and a plus 1 is greater than 1 and the current value of s is greater than or equal to twice the difference between b and a plus 1, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, either b - a + 1 is less than or equal to 1 or s is less than 2 * (b - a + 1), and 'NO' is printed.***
