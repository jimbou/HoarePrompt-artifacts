Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `l` is an empty list, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list, `c` is equal to the sum of all integers in the original list, `_` is 0, `a` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `b` is an integer, `s` is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index `a - 2`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index `a - 2`, which is calculated by subtracting the cumulative sum up to index `a - 2` from the original value of `s`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
