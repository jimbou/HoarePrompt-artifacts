The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line increments the value of `c` by the value of `x`, and the second line appends the new value of `c` to the list `p`.

Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, m is 1, l is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, p is a list containing the original value of c and the new value of c which is equal to the original value of c plus x, c is equal to the original value of c plus x, _ is 1, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1, x is the second integer in the list l**
