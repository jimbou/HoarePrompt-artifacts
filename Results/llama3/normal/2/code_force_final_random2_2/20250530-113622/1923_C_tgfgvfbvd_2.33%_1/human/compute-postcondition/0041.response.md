Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, m is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, l is a list of integers from the input, p is an empty list, c is 0, _ is 1, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1. If a - 2 >= 0, then s is the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index b - 1 minus the cumulative sum of all integers in the original list up to index a - 2. Otherwise, no change is made to s. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

The first line assigns the first integer from the input to `n` and the second integer to `m`. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `l`. The third and fourth lines initialize `p` as an empty list and `c` as 0, respectively. The fifth line does not affect any variables. The sixth line assigns 1 to `_`.
