Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer, two integers, and a list of integers, followed by a number of queries. It calculates the cumulative sum of the list of integers and then answers queries by determining if the sum of a specified sub-range of the list is greater than or equal to twice the length of the sub-range. The function prints 'YES' if the condition is met and 'NO' otherwise.**
