Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, p is a list containing the value of c which is equal to the first integer in the list plus x, c is equal to the first integer in the list plus x, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated pair of integers and a space-separated list of integers, x is the second integer in the list.**

The code modifies the value of `c` by adding `x` to it, and then appends this new value of `c` to the list `p`. The value of `x` is the second integer in the list `l`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
