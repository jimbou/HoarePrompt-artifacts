Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once, regardless of the program state. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state.

State: **n is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, l1 is a list of strings representing the first line of stdin, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, i is 0, ans is an empty list, temp is 1**
