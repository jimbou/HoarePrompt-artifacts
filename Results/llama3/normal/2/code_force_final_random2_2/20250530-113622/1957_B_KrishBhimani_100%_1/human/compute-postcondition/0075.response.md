Output State: **The loop has executed for the number of times specified by the first integer in the first line of stdin. The values of n and k have been updated to the values in the last line of stdin. If n is 1, the value of k is printed. If n is larger than 1, an empty list arr is created, k0 is set to k, temp is a power of 2 that is less than k, i is the number of times the loop executed, ans is a list containing (1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) zeros, and the elements of the list ans are printed: (1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) zeros.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has finished executing for the specified number of times, and the values of n and k have been updated to the last line of input. If n is 1, the value of k is printed. If n is larger than 1, the loop creates an empty list, sets k0 to k, finds the largest power of 2 less than k, calculates the number of times the loop executed, creates a list containing the largest power of 2 less than k minus 1, k minus the sum of the list, and n minus the length of the list zeros, and prints the elements of the list.
