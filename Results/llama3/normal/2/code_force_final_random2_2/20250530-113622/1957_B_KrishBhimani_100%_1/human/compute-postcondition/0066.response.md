Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again, regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state.

State: **n is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, l1 is a list of strings representing the first line of stdin, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, ans is an empty list. If temp * 2 is less than k, then temp is twice its original value and i is 1 more than its original value. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
