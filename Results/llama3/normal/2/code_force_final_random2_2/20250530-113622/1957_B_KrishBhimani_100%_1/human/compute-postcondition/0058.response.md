Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, l1 is a list of strings representing the first line of stdin, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, i is 1, ans is an empty list, temp is equal to its original value multiplied by 2. The current value of (temp * 2) is less than k.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line multiplies the value of `temp` by 2, effectively doubling its original value. The second line increments the value of `i` by 1. 

Since `temp` was originally 1, doubling it makes it 2. The value of `i` was 0, so incrementing it makes it 1. 

All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet. The value of `n`, `k`, `_`, `l1`, `arr`, `k0`, and `ans` remain the same as in the initial state. The condition that the current value of `(temp * 2)` is less than `k` still holds true, as `temp` is now 2 and `k` is still the second integer in the first line of stdin.
