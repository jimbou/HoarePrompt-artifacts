Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again regardless of the current state. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state.

State: **n is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, l1 is a list of strings representing the first line of stdin, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, ans is an empty list. If temp * 2 is less than k, then i is 1 and temp is equal to its original value multiplied by 2. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
