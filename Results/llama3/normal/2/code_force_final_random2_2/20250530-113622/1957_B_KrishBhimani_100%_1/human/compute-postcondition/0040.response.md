Postcondition: ***n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of stdin, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer equal to k. If temp * 2 is less than k, then i is an integer equal to its original value plus 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
