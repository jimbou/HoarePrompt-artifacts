Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of stdin, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer equal to k, temp is an integer such that temp * 2 is greater than or equal to k, i is an integer equal to the number of times temp can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to k, ans is a list containing (1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) zeros.**

In this output state, the value of `n` and `k` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `_` is still 1, and `stdin` still contains multiple lines of input minus one line. The list `arr` is still empty. The value of `k0` is still equal to `k`. The value of `temp` is still an integer such that `temp * 2` is greater than or equal to `k`, and the value of `i` is still an integer equal to the number of times `temp` can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to `k`. The list `ans` now contains three elements: `(1 << i) - 1`, `k - sum(ans)`, and `n - len(ans)` zeros.
