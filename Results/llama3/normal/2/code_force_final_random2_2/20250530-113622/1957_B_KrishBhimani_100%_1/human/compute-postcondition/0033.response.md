Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of stdin, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer equal to k, i is 1, ans is an empty list, and temp is an integer such that temp * 2 is less than or equal to k.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `temp` and `i`. The first line doubles the value of `temp`, and the second line increments `i` by 1. The new value of `temp` is twice its original value, and `i` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
