Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of stdin, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer equal to k, temp is an integer such that temp * 2 is greater than or equal to k, i is an integer equal to the number of times temp can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to k.**

This output state means that the loop will continue to execute until the value of `temp` is doubled to the point where it is greater than or equal to `k`. At this point, the loop will break, and the final values of `temp` and `i` will be determined. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.
