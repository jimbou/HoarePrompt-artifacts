Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of stdin, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer equal to k, temp is an integer equal to its original value times 2, i is an integer equal to its original value plus 1.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line multiplies the value of `temp` by 2, effectively doubling its original value. The second line increments the value of `i` by 1, adding 1 to its original value. 

Since `temp` is multiplied by 2, its new value is twice its original value. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so its new value is one more than its original value. 

All other variables (`n`, `k`, `_`, `stdin`, `arr`, and `k0`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.
