Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, `l1` is a list of strings representing the first line of stdin, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, `i` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The condition `temp * 2 is larger than or equal to k` is still valid.
