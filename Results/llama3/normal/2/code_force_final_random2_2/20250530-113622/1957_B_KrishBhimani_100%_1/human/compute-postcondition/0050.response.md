Postcondition: ***n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of stdin, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line. If n is 1, the value of k which is equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin is being printed. Otherwise, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer equal to k, temp is an integer such that temp * 2 is greater than or equal to k, i is an integer equal to the number of times temp can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to k, ans is a list containing (1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) zeros, and the elements of ans are being printed: (1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) zeros.***
