Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, l1 is a list of strings representing the first line of stdin, n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of stdin, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin. If n is equal to 1, the value of k which is equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin is being printed. Otherwise, n is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, l1 is a list of strings representing the first line of stdin, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, ans is a list of integers with three elements: the first element is (1 << i) - 1, the second element is k - sum(ans), and the remaining elements are 0s, temp is a power of 2 that is less than or equal to k, i is the power to which 2 must be raised to get temp, and this is printed: (1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and 0s.***
