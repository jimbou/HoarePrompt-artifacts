Output State: **n is a positive integer larger than 1, k is an integer, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, i is 0, ans is an empty list, temp is 1**

The code initializes several variables: `arr` is set to an empty list, `k0` is assigned the value of `k`, `i` is set to 0, `ans` is set to an empty list, and `temp` is set to 1. The values of `n`, `k`, and `_` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, as no input operations are performed.
