Output State: **`n` is a positive integer larger than 1, `k` is an integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`. If temp * 2 < k, then temp is 4 and i is 2. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `k`, `_`, `arr`, and `k0` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input minus one line. The condition "If temp * 2 < k, then temp is 4 and i is 2" is still valid, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the `break` statement.
