This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains a single integer t, and each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k. For each pair of n and k, if n is 1, it prints the value of k. If n is larger than 1, it calculates a list of values based on k and prints the list, which contains a power of 2 less than k, the difference between k and the sum of the list, and n-2 zeros. The function repeats this process for the number of times specified by the first integer t.
