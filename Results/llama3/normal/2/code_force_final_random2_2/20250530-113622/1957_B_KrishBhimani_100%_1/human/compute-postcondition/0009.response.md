The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line multiplies the value of `temp` by 2, and the second line increments the value of `i` by 1.

Since `temp` is initially 1 and its current value times 2 is less than `k`, the new value of `temp` will be 2. The value of `i` is initially 0, so after incrementing it by 1, it becomes 1.

No other variables are affected by the code snippet. The values of `n`, `k`, `_`, `arr`, `k0`, and `ans` remain the same as in the initial state. Stdin still contains multiple lines of input minus one line.

Output State: **n is a positive integer larger than 1, k is an integer, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, i is 1, ans is an empty list, temp is 2.**
