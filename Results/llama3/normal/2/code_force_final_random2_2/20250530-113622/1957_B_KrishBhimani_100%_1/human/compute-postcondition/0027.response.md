Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of stdin, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line.**

The code first reads the first line of stdin, splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters, and assigns this list to `l1`. Then, it converts the first two elements of `l1` to integers using the `map` function and assigns these integers to `n` and `k`, respectively. This means that `n` and `k` now hold the values of the first and second integers in the first line of stdin, respectively. The variable `_` remains unchanged, still holding the value 1. Since one line of stdin has been read, the number of lines in stdin decreases by one.
