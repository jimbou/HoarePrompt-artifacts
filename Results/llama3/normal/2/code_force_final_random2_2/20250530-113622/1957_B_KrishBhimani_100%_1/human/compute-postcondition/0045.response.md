Output State: n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of stdin, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer equal to k, i is an integer equal to the number of times temp * 2 is less than k, temp is an integer such that temp * 2 is greater than or equal to k.

This output state means that the loop will continue to execute until temp * 2 is no longer less than k. At that point, the loop will break, and the values of i and temp will be determined by the number of times the loop executed. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.
