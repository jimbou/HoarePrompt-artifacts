Output State: **`n` is a positive integer larger than 1, `k` is an integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `i` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values, and the only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input minus one line, and all other variables remain unchanged.
