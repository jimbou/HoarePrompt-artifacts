Output State: **n is a positive integer larger than 1, k is an integer, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, temp is a power of 2 that is less than k, and i is the number of times the loop executed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables not affected by the loop head and body remain unchanged. The variable temp will be the largest power of 2 that is less than k, and the variable i will be the number of times the loop executed, which is the number of times temp was doubled before it was no longer less than k.
