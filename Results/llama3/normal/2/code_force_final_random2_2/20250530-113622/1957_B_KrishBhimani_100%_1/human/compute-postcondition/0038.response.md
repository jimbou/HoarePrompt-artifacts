Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of stdin, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer equal to k, temp is an integer such that temp * 2 is less than or equal to k, i is an integer equal to its original value plus 1.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. Similarly, the values of `k`, `_`, `stdin`, `arr`, and `k0` also remain the same as they are not affected by the code. The value of `temp` is doubled, but its relationship with `k` remains the same, i.e., `temp * 2` is less than or equal to `k`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it equal to its original value plus 1.
