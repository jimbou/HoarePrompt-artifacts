Postcondition: **n is a positive integer, k is an integer, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line. If n equals 1, the value of k is printed. If n is larger than 1, an empty list arr is created, k0 is set to k, temp is a power of 2 that is less than k, i is the number of times the loop executed, ans is a list containing (1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) zeros, and the elements of the list ans are printed: (1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) zeros.**
