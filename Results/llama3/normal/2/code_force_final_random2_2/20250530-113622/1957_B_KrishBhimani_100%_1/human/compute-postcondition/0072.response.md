Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the elements of the list `ans`.

The list `ans` has three elements:

1. The first element is `(1 << i) - 1`, where `i` is the power to which 2 must be raised to get `temp`. Since `temp` is a power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`. Therefore, the first element of `ans` is `(1 << i) - 1`, which is one less than the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.

2. The second element is `k - sum(ans)`. Since `ans` has only three elements, and the remaining elements are 0s, `sum(ans)` is equal to the sum of the first two elements of `ans`. Therefore, the second element of `ans` is `k` minus the sum of the first element of `ans` and the second element of `ans`.

3. The remaining elements of `ans` are 0s.

Therefore, the print statement will print the first element of `ans`, which is one less than the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`, the second element of `ans`, which is `k` minus the sum of the first element of `ans` and the second element of `ans`, and the remaining elements of `ans`, which are 0s.

Output: **(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1 + (k - ((1 << i) - 1))), 0**
