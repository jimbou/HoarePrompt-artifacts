Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, l1 is a list of strings representing the first line of stdin, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, ans is an empty list, temp is a power of 2 that is less than or equal to k, i is the power to which 2 must be raised to get temp.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variables temp and i. The variable temp is now a power of 2 that is less than or equal to k, and the variable i is the power to which 2 must be raised to get temp. This is because the loop continues to double temp and increment i as long as temp * 2 is less than k, and it breaks out of the loop when temp * 2 is no longer less than k.
