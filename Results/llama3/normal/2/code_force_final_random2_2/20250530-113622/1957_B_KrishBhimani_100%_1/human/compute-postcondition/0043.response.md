Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of stdin, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer equal to k, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables n, k, _, stdin, arr, and k0 remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
