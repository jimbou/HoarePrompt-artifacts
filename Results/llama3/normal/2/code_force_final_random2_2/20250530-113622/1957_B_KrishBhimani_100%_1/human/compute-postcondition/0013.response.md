Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again, regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state.

State: **n is a positive integer larger than 1, k is an integer, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, if temp * 2 < k, then i is 1 and temp is 2. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
