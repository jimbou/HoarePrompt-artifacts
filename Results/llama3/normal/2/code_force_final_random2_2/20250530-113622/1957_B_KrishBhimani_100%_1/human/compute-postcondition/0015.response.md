Output State: **`n` is a positive integer larger than 1, `k` is an integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, if `temp * 2 < k`, then `i` is 1 and `temp` is 2. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement twice. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `_`, `arr`, and `k0` remain unchanged, and the condition regarding `temp`, `i`, and `k` still holds. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement twice.
