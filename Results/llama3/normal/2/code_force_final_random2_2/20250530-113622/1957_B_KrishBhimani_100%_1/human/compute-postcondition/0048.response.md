The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list.

Based on the precondition, `ans` is a list containing three elements:

1. `(1 << i) - 1`: This is a binary left shift operation, where `i` is the number of times `temp` can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to `k`. The result is subtracted by 1.
2. `k - sum(ans)`: This is the difference between `k` and the sum of the elements in the `ans` list.
3. `n - len(ans)` zeros: This is a sequence of zeros, where the length is equal to `n` minus the length of the `ans` list.

Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, and `temp` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of the elements in the `ans` list. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated values.

Output: **(1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) zeros (where i is the number of times temp can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to k, k is the second integer in the first line of stdin, and n is the first integer in the first line of stdin)**
