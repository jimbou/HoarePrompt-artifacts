The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the first integer in the first line of stdin the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of stdin. So for the loop to be executed one more time _ must be 2 and n must be greater than 2.
State: **n is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line. If n is 2, the value of k which is equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin is being printed. Otherwise, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer equal to k, temp is an integer such that temp * 2 is greater than or equal to k, i is an integer equal to the number of times temp can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to k, ans is a list containing (1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) zeros, and the elements of ans are being printed: (1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) zeros.**
