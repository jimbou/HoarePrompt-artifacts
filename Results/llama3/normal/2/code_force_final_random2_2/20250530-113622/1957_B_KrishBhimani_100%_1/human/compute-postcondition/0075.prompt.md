Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l1 = input().split()
    n, k = list(map(int, l1))
    if n == 1:
        print(k)
    else:
        arr = []
        k0 = k
        i = 0
        ans = []
        temp = 1
        while True:
            if temp * 2 < k:
                temp *= 2
                i += 1
            else:
                break
        ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
        ans.append(k - sum(ans))
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer, k is an integer, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line. If n equals 1, the value of k is printed. If n is larger than 1, an empty list arr is created, k0 is set to k, temp is a power of 2 that is less than k, i is the number of times the loop executed, ans is a list containing (1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) zeros, and the elements of the list ans are printed: (1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) zeros.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of stdin, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line. If n is 1, the value of k which is equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin is being printed. Otherwise, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer equal to k, temp is an integer such that temp * 2 is greater than or equal to k, i is an integer equal to the number of times temp can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to k, ans is a list containing (1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) zeros, and the elements of ans are being printed: (1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) zeros.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, l1 is a list of strings representing the first line of stdin, n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of stdin, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin. If n is equal to 1, the value of k which is equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin is being printed. Otherwise, n is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, l1 is a list of strings representing the first line of stdin, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, ans is a list of integers with three elements: the first element is (1 << i) - 1, the second element is k - sum(ans), and the remaining elements are 0s, temp is a power of 2 that is less than or equal to k, i is the power to which 2 must be raised to get temp, and this is printed: (1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and 0s.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
