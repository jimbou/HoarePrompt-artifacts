Output State: **n is a positive integer larger than 1, k is an integer, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, temp is 4, i is 2**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `temp *= 2` and `i += 1`. 

The first line multiplies the value of `temp` by 2. Since `temp` was 2, it becomes 4. 

The second line increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `i` was 1, it becomes 2. 

No other variables are affected by the code snippet. The values of `n`, `k`, `_`, `stdin`, `arr`, and `k0` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the final output state includes the updated values of `temp` and `i`, along with the unchanged values of the other variables.
