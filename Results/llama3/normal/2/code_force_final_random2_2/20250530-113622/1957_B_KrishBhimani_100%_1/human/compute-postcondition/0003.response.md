Based on the initial state, we know that `n` is a positive integer and equals 1, `k` is an integer, and `_` is 0. The `print` statement simply prints the value of `k`.

Since the value of `k` is not explicitly given, we can't determine its exact value. However, we can describe its value based on the given information.

Output: **k (where k is an integer)**
