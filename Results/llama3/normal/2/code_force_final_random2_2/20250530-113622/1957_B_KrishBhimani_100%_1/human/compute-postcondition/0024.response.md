The code prints the elements of the list `ans` in a row, separated by spaces.
The list `ans` contains the following elements: `(1 << i) - 1`, `k - sum(ans)`, and `n - len(ans)` zeros.
Since `i` is the number of times the loop executed, `(1 << i) - 1` is a power of 2 minus 1, which is a sequence of `i` ones in binary representation.
`k - sum(ans)` is the difference between `k` and the sum of all elements in the list `ans`.
`n - len(ans)` zeros are appended to the list `ans`.
Output: **n is a positive integer larger than 1, k is an integer, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, temp is a power of 2 that is less than k, i is the number of times the loop executed, ans is a list containing (1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) zeros, and the elements of the list ans are printed: (1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) zeros**
