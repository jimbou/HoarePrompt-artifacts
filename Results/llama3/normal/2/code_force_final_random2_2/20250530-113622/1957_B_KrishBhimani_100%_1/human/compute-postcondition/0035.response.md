Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of stdin, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, `_` is 1, `k0` is an integer equal to `k`, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables retain their initial values, and the only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input minus one line.
