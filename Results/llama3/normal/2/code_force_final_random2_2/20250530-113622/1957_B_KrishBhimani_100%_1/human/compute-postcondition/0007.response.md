Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once, regardless of the values of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state.

State: **n is a positive integer larger than 1, k is an integer, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, i is 0, ans is an empty list, temp is 1**
