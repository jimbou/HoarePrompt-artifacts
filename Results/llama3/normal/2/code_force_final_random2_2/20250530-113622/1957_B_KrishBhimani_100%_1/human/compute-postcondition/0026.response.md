The only objects in the loop head are variables `_` and `stdin`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `_` and `stdin`. If `_` is less than the number of lines in `stdin`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple lines of input minus one line. So for the loop to be executed one more time `_` is 1 and `stdin` contains multiple lines of input minus two lines.
State: **n is a positive integer, k is an integer, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus two lines.**
