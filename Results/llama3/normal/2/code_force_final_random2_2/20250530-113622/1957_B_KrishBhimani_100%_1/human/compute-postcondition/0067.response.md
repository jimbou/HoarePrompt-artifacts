Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, l1 is a list of strings representing the first line of stdin, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, ans is an empty list, temp is four times its original value, i is 2 more than its original value.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `temp *= 2` and `i += 1`. The first line doubles the value of `temp`, and the second line increments `i` by 1. Since the initial state specifies that if `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `temp` is twice its original value and `i` is 1 more than its original value, we can infer that the condition is met, and the code executes the doubling of `temp` and the increment of `i` twice. Therefore, `temp` becomes four times its original value, and `i` becomes 2 more than its original value. All other variables remain unchanged.
