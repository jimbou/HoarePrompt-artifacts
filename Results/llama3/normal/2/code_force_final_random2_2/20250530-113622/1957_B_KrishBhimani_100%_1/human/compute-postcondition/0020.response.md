Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer larger than 1, k is an integer, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k. If temp * 2 is less than k, then temp is 8 and i is 3. Otherwise, temp is 4 and i is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
