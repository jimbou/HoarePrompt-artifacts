Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of stdin, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, `_` is 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is an integer equal to `k`, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `_`, `arr`, and `k0` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input minus one line. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The condition regarding `temp` and `i` is no longer applicable since we break out of the loop or if statement.
