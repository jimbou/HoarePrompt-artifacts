The code prints the elements of the list `ans`. The list `ans` contains the binary representation of the number `k` with leading zeros, where the number of leading zeros is equal to `n - len(ans)`. The binary representation is calculated by doubling the value of `temp` until it is greater than or equal to `k`, and then subtracting the sum of the binary representation from `k`. The remaining value is the binary representation of `k` with leading zeros.

Output: **n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of stdin, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer equal to k, temp is an integer such that temp * 2 is greater than or equal to k, i is an integer equal to the number of times temp can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to k, ans is a list containing (1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) zeros, and the elements of ans are being printed: (1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) zeros**
