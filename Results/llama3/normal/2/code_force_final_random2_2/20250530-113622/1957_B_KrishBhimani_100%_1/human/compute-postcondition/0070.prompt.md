Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, l1 is a list of strings representing the first line of stdin, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, i is 0, ans is an empty list, temp is 1
Code of the loop:
while True:
    if temp * 2 < k:
        temp *= 2
        i += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, l1 is a list of strings representing the first line of stdin, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, ans is an empty list. If temp * 2 is less than k, then i is 1 and temp is equal to its original value multiplied by 2. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *n is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, l1 is a list of strings representing the first line of stdin, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, ans is an empty list. If temp * 2 is less than k, then temp is twice its original value and i is 1 more than its original value. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *n is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, l1 is a list of strings representing the first line of stdin, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of stdin, ans is an empty list. If temp * 2 is less than k, then temp is four times its original value and i is 2 more than its original value. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
