Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `j` is equal to `n`, `s` is a string from the input. If any string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE'. If any string `s` contains more than one '1's, then `b` is 'SQUARE'.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

After the loop finishes executing, the value of `t` remains at least 1, and `i` remains 0. The value of `n` is still an integer, but `j` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The value of `s` is the last string read from the input. If any of the strings read from the input contained exactly one '1', then `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'. If any of the strings read from the input contained more than one '1's, then `b` is set to 'SQUARE'.
