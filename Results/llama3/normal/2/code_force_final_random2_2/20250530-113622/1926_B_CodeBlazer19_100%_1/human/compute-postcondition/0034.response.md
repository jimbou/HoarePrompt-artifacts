To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `j` is equal to `n` before the loop starts, we can adjust `j` to be 0 (the starting value of the range) and `n` to be at least 1.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer from the input and must be at least 1, `j` is 0, `s` is not defined, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string**
