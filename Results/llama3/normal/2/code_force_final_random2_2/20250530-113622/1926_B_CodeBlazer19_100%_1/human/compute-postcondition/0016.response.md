Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is a string from the input. If the string `s` contains more than one '1's, then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If the string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains no '1's, then `a` is 0 and `b` remains an empty string.***
