Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `s` is a string from the input. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is updated based on the new value of `s`. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is updated based on the new value of `s` and `b` is 'SQUARE'.***
