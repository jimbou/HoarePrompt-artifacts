To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. To execute the loop again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

The other variables `t`, `i`, `s`, `a`, and `b` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1. If the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one '1's, then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If the string `s` contains no '1's, then `a` is 0 and `b` remains an empty string.**
