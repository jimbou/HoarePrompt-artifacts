Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10) followed by `n` strings of `n` characters each.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = 0
    b = ''
    for j in range(n):
        s = input()
        if s.count('1') == 1:
            a = 'TRIANGLE'
        elif s.count('1') > 1:
            b = 'SQUARE'
    if a != 0:
        print(a)
    else:
        print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `j` is equal to `n`, `s` is a string from the input. If string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the character '1', then 'TRIANGLE' is printed. If string `s` contains more than one '1's, then 'SQUARE' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `j` is equal to `n`, `s` is a string from the input. stdin is empty. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then the value of `a` is printed, where `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then the value of `b` is printed, where `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', then the value of `b` is printed, where `b` is an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `j` is equal to `n`, `s` is a string from the input, stdin is empty. If `a` is 'TRIANGLE', then 'TRIANGLE' is printed. Otherwise, if `a` is 0, then the value of `b` is printed, which is either an empty string or 'SQUARE'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
