Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is a string from the input. If the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one '1's, then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If the string `s` contains no '1's, then `a` is 0 and `b` remains an empty string.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. The variable `s` is now assigned the value of the input string. The conditions for `a` and `b` are still dependent on the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`.
