According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `j` is 3, `s` is a string from the input, stdin is empty. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.**
