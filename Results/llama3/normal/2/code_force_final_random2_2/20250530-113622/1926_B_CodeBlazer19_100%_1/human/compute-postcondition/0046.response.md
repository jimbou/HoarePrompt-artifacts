Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer at least 2, `j` is 1, `s` is a string from the input, if `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE', stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer at least 2, `j` is 1, and `s` is a string from the input. The value of `a` and `b` depends on the number of '1's in `s`. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. The stdin is empty.
