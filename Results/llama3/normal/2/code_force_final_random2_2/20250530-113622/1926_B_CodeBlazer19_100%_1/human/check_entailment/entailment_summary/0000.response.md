Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The logic used to determine whether the shape is a triangle or a square is flawed. The program checks if a row has exactly one '1' and if so, it sets the shape to 'TRIANGLE'. However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine a triangle. A triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, as long as the number of '1's increases by 2 in each subsequent row.

Moreover, the program checks if a row has more than one '1' and if so, it sets the shape to 'SQUARE'. However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine a square. A square must have the same number of '1's in each row, and the '1's must be positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

The program does not correctly implement the conditions for a triangle or a square as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
