Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer at least 1, `j` is 0, `s` is a string that contains more than one '1', `a` is 0, and `b` is 'SQUARE'.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `s`, and `a` remain unchanged from the initial state. The only change is that the variable `b` is now assigned the string value 'SQUARE'.
