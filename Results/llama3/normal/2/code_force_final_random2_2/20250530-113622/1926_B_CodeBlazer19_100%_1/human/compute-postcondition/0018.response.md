The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `s` is a string from the input. If the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one '1's, then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If the string `s` contains no '1's, then `a` is 0 and `b` remains an empty string.**
