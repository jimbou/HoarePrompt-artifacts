Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `j` is 3, `s` is a string from the input, stdin is empty. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `s` is updated to be the new string input from the user. The values of `a` and `b` are determined based on the number of '1's in the new string `s`. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.
