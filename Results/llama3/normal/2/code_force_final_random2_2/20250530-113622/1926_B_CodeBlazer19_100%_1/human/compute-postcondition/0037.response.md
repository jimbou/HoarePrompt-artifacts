Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer at least 1, `j` is 0, `s` is a string that contains exactly one '1', `a` is 'TRIANGLE', `b` is an empty string, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 'TRIANGLE', while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The variable `t` is still at least 2, `i` is still 1, `n` is still an integer at least 1, `j` is still 0, `s` is still a string that contains exactly one '1', and `b` is still an empty string. The stdin still contains no input.
