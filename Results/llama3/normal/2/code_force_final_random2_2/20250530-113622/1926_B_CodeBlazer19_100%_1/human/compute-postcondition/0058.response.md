Output: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `j` is equal to `n`, `s` is a string from the input. The current value of `a` is not 0, which means `s` contains exactly one '1', and `b` is an empty string. stdin is empty, and the value of `a` is being printed, where `a` is 1**
