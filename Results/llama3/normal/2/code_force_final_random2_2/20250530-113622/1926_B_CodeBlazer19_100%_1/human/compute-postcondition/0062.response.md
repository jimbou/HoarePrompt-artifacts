Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `j` is equal to `n`, `s` is a string from the input. stdin is empty. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then the value of `a` is printed, where `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then the value of `b` is printed, where `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', then the value of `b` is printed, where `b` is an empty string.***
