Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer at least 3, `j` is 2, `s` is a string from the input. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `j`, and `s` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `b` is updated to 'SQUARE', regardless of the number of '1's in `s`. The value of `a` depends on the number of '1's in `s`: if `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE'; if `s` contains more than one '1' or no '1's, then `a` is 0. The stdin remains empty.
