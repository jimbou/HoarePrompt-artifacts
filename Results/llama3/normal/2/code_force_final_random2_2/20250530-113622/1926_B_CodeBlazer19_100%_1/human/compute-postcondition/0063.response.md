The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer from the input, `j` is equal to `n`, `s` is a string from the input. stdin is empty. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then the value of `a` is printed, where `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then the value of `b` is printed, where `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', then the value of `b` is printed, where `b` is an empty string.**
