The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that the standard input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) followed by `t` test cases, the value of `t` is now known to be between 1 and 100.

The remaining input in the standard input is still `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10) followed by `n` strings of `n` characters each.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10) followed by `n` strings of `n` characters each.**
