Output: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `j` is equal to `n`, `s` is a string from the input. `a` is 0. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', then `b` is an empty string. stdin is empty, and the value of `b` is being printed, where `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE' depending on the number of '1's in the string `s`.**
