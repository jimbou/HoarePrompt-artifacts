Output State: **t is at least 2, i is 1, n is an integer from the input, j is equal to n, s is not defined, a is 0, b is an empty string**.

The code block consists of three lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. This means that `n` now holds a specific integer value from the input, replacing its previous value. The second line initializes a new variable `a` and assigns it the value 0. The third line initializes another new variable `b` and assigns it an empty string. The variables `t`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by the code block, so they retain their initial values. The variable `s` is not defined after the code execution because it was only defined in the precondition based on the input, but the input is consumed by the first line of the code, leaving `s` without a value.
