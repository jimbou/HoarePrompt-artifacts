Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer at least 3, `j` is 2, `s` is a string from the input. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string. stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `s` is updated to be a new string from the input. The values of `a` and `b` are determined based on the number of '1's in the new string `s`. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string. The stdin is empty after reading the input for `s`.
