This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the shape ('TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE') of the figure formed by '1's in each test case. It accepts no parameters and returns no value, only printing the results for each test case. After execution, stdin is empty, and the function has printed the shape for each of the 't' test cases.
