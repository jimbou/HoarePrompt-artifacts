Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `j` is 4, `s` is a string from the input, stdin contains no input. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.***
