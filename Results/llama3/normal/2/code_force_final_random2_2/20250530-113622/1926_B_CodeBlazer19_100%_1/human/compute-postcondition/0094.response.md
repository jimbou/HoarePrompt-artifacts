Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin is empty, `i` is equal to `t`, `n` is an integer, `j` is equal to `n`, `s` is a string from the input, `a` is either 0 or 'TRIANGLE', `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE'. The value of `a` or `b` is printed for each test case.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the input `t` test cases have been processed, and for each test case, the corresponding output ('TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE') has been printed. The loop variables `i`, `n`, and `j` have reached their final values, and the input string `s` has been processed. The variables `a` and `b` hold the final values determined by the loop, and their values have been printed for each test case. The input stream `stdin` is empty, indicating that all input has been consumed.
