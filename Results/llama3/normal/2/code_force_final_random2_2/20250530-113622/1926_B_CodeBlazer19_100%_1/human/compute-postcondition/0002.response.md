Output State: **t is at least 1, i is 0, n is an integer, a is 0, b is an empty string, stdin contains no input**

The code snippet reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, leaving stdin empty. It then initializes `a` to 0 and `b` to an empty string. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
