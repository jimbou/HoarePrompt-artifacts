Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `j` is 3, `s` is a string from the input, `a` is either 0 or 'TRIANGLE', `b` is 'SQUARE'.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `s` is still a string from the input. The value of `a` depends on the original value of `s`: if `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE'; if `s` contains more than one '1' or no '1', then `a` is 0. The value of `b` is now 'SQUARE', regardless of its original value.
