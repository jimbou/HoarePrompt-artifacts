Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The logic used to determine whether the shape is a triangle or a square is flawed. The program checks if a row has exactly one '1' and if so, it sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'. However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine if the shape is a triangle. A triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, as long as the number of '1's increases by 2 in each subsequent row.

Similarly, the program checks if a row has more than one '1' and if so, it sets `b` to 'SQUARE'. However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine if the shape is a square. A square must have the same number of '1's in each row, and the '1's must be positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

The program also has a logical error in the way it prints the result. It checks if `a` is not equal to 0, and if so, it prints 'TRIANGLE'. However, `a` is initialized to 0, and it is only set to 'TRIANGLE' if a row has exactly one '1'. If no such row is found, `a` will remain 0, and the program will print 'SQUARE' even if the shape is not a square.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and will produce incorrect results for many test cases.

Correctness: **False**
