The code prints the value of `b`, which depends on the number of '1' characters in the string `s`.

If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `b` is an empty string.
If `s` contains more than one '1', then `b` is 'SQUARE'.
If `s` contains no '1', then `b` is an empty string.

Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `b`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either an empty string or 'SQUARE'.

Output: **either an empty string or 'SQUARE' (depending on the number of '1' characters in the string s)**
