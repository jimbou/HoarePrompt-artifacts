Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `j` is 4, `s` is a string from the input, stdin contains no input. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `s` is updated to a new string from the input. The stdin is now empty since it has been used to read the input for `s`. The conditions for `a` and `b` are still dependent on the number of '1's in `s`, but now `s` has a new value.
