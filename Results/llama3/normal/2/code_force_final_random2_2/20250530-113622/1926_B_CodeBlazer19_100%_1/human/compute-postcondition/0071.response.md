Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `j` is 0, `s` is a string from the input, `a` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', The number of occurrences of '1' in `s` is more than 1, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to 'SQUARE', while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The number of occurrences of '1' in `s` is still more than 1, and stdin is still empty.
