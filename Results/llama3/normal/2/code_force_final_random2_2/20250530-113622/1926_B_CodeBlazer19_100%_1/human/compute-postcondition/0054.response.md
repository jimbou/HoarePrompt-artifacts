Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer at least 3, `j` is 2, `s` is a string from the input. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string. stdin is empty.***
