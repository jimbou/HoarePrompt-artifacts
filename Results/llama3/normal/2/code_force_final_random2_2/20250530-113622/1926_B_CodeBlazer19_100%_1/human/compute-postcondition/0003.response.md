The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is at least 1, i is 0, n is an integer, a is 0, b is an empty string, stdin contains no input does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and j is now 0. 
State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string, stdin contains no input, `j` is 0**
