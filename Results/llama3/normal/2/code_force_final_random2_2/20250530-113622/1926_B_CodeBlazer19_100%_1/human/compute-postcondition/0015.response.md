Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is a string from the input. If the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If the string `s` contains more than one '1's, then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If the string `s` contains no '1's, then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to 'SQUARE', regardless of the number of '1's in the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
