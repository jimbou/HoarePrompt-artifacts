Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly identify the shape in the grid. It checks if a row has exactly one '1' and if so, it prints 'TRIANGLE'. However, this is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a triangle. A triangle can have multiple rows with multiple '1's. The program also checks if a row has more than one '1' and if so, it prints 'SQUARE'. However, this is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a square. A square can have multiple rows with multiple '1's, but the '1's must be in the same column.

A correct solution would need to check the pattern of '1's in the grid to determine if it is a triangle or a square. For example, it could check if the number of '1's in each row increases by 2 for a triangle, or if the '1's are in the same column for a square.

Here is an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:

Input:

    4
    
    0000
    
    0010
    
    0110
    
    1110

Output:

    TRIANGLE

However, the correct output should be 'TRIANGLE' because the shape is a triangle, not a square.
