To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `b`, `n`, and `m`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `min(n, m)` is at least 3 (since the range starts from 2 and goes up to `min(n, m) + 1`). 

Since `b` is the loop variable, it will take values from 2 to `min(n, m)`. For the loop to execute, `min(n, m)` must be at least 3. 

The other states (`t` is at least 2, `T` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2) do not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `T` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `ans` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2, `b` is 2, `min(n, m)` is at least 3**
