To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):`. The objects involved are `b`, `n`, and `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, and `min(n, m)` is at least 4.

For the loop to execute again, `b` needs to be incremented by 1, so `b` becomes 4. The loop will execute as long as `b` is less than or equal to `min(n, m)`. Since `min(n, m)` is at least 4, we need to ensure that `min(n, m)` is at least 5 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `b` is 4
* `min(n, m)` is at least 5

The other variables `t`, `T`, `ans`, and `stdin` are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `T` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2, `b` is 4, `min(n, m)` is at least 5**
