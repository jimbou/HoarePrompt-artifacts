The `print(ans)` statement will print the calculated value of `ans`, which is equal to `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`.

Here, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, and `b` is the minimum of `n` and `m`. The expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` calculates the integer division of `n + b` by `b * b` for each `b` in the range from 2 to `min(n, m)` (inclusive). The `sum` function then adds up all these values.

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`, which is the sum of `n` and the sum of the integer divisions of `n + b` by `b * b` for each `b` in the range from 2 to `min(n, m)`.

Output: **n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1)) (where n and m are positive integers and b is the minimum of n and m)**
