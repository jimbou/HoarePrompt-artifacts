Output State: **t is at least 2, T is 2, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, ans is equal to n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1)), stdin contains multiple test cases - 2, b is min(n, m), min(n, m) is at least 2**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` is at least 2, `T` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `ans` is equal to `n` plus the sum of `(n + b)` divided by `(b * b)` for all `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2, `b` is `min(n, m)`, and `min(n, m)` is at least 2.
