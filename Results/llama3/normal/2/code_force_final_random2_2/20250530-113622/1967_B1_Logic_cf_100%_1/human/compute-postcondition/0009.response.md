Output State: **t is at least 1, T is 0, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, ans is equal to n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1)), stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, b is min(n, m)**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` is still at least 1, `T` is still 0, `n` and `m` are still positive integers, `ans` is the sum of `n` and the sum of the series `(n + b) // (b * b)` for `b` ranging from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m`, and `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 1. The loop variable `b` is now equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`.
