The code `t = int(input())` reads the first line from the standard input, which contains the number of test cases `t`, and converts it to an integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing two positive integers n, m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6), with one line already read.**

In natural language, the output state is that the variable `t` now holds the number of test cases, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The standard input still contains multiple test cases, but the first line has already been read, so the remaining input consists of the test cases, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m` within the specified ranges.
