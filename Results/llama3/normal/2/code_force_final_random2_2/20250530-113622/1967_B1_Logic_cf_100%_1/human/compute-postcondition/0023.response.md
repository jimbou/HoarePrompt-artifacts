To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `T` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `T` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `T` is 1 and `t` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `T` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `T` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `ans` is equal to `n` + `sum((n + b) // (b * b)` for `b` in `range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `b` is `min(n, m)`, and the value of `ans` which is equal to `n` + `sum((n + b) // (b * b)` for `b` in `range(2, min(n, m) + 1))` is being printed**
