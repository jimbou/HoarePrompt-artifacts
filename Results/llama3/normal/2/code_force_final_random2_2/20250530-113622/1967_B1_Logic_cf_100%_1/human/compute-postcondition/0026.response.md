Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `T` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2, `b` is 2, `min(n, m)` is at least 3**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to `n + (n + 2) // 4`, which is the result of adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to the initial value of `ans`, which was equal to `n`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `t`, `T`, `n`, `m`, `b`, and `min(n, m)` are still valid.
