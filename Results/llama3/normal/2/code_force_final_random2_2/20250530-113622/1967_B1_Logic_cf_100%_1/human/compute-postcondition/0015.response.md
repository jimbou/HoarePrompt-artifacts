Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `T` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `m` is a positive integer and at least 2, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `b` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to `n + (n + 2) // 4`, which is the result of adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to the initial value of `ans`, where `b` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
