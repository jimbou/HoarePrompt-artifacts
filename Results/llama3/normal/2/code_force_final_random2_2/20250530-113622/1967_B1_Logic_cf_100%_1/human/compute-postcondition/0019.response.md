Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `T` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and at least 4, `m` is a positive integer and at least 4, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9 + (n + 4) // 16`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `b` is 4**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its previous value. Since `b` is 4, the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` simplifies to `(n + 4) // 16`. The other variables remain unchanged.
