The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of `(n + b) // (b * b)`. Since `n` is a positive integer and at least 3, and `b` is 3, the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` is equivalent to `(n + 3) // 9`. The value of `ans` is initially equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4`. After the update, `ans` becomes `n + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `T` is 0, `n` is a positive integer and at least 3, `m` is a positive integer and at least 3, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `b` is 3**
