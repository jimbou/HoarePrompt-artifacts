To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `b`, and the loop condition depends on `n` and `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is 3, `n` is a positive integer and at least 3, and `m` is a positive integer and at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `b` must be less than `min(n, m) + 1`. Since `b` is 3, it must be incremented by 1 to 4. For the loop to execute again, `min(n, m) + 1` must be greater than 4, which means `min(n, m)` must be at least 4.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `T` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and at least 4, `m` is a positive integer and at least 4, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `b` is 4**
