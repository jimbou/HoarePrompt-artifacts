Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `T` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and at least 3, `m` is a positive integer and at least 3, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `b` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding the result of the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)`, where `b` is 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now a combination of its initial value `n + (n + 2) // 4` and the additional term `(n + 3) // 9`.
