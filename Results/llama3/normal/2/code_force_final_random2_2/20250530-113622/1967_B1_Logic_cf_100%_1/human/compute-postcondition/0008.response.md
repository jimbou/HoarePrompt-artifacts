Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `T` is 0, `n` is a positive integer and at least 4, `m` is a positive integer and at least 4, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9 + (n + 4) // 16`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `b` is 4**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its previous value. Since `b` is 4, this expression simplifies to `(n + 4) // 16`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one less than before since one test case has been processed.
