The only objects in the loop head are variables  b, n and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable b, n and m. If b is less than min(n, m), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, b is 2, n is at least 2, m is at least 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time b must be 3 and n and m must be at least 3.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `T` is 0, `n` is a positive integer and at least 3, `m` is a positive integer and at least 3, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `b` is 3**
