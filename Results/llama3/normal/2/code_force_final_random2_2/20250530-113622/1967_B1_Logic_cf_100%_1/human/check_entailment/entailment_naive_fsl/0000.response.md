Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. The issue lies in the line `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`. This line is intended to calculate the number of pairs `(a, b)` where `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, it does not take into account the fact that `a` can be less than `b`.

For example, when `n = 10` and `m = 8`, the program will not count the pair `(5, 4)` because `5` is less than `b = 4`. However, `5 + 4 = 9` is indeed a multiple of `4 * gcd(5, 4) = 4`.

To fix this issue, the program needs to iterate over all possible values of `b` up to `m`, not just up to `min(n, m)`. Additionally, it needs to calculate the number of pairs `(a, b)` where `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` for each value of `b`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```
This corrected program uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b`, and checks whether `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` for each pair. The `gcd` function is used to calculate the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.
