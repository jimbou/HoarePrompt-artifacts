Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two positive integers n and m. It calculates a value 'ans' for each test case, which is initially set to n and then incremented by the sum of the integer divisions of (n + b) by (b * b) for all b from 2 to the minimum of n and m. The calculated 'ans' value for each test case is then printed to the standard output.**
