To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `b`, `n`, and `m`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `b` is less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`. At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is 3, `n` is at least 3, and `m` is at least 3.

For the loop to execute again, `b` must be incremented by 1, so `b` becomes 4. Since `b` is now 4, the minimum of `n` and `m` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `T` is 0, `n` is a positive integer and at least 4, `m` is a positive integer and at least 4, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `b` is 4**
