To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `b`, `n`, and `m`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `min(n, m)` is at least 2, because the range starts from 2. 

Since `n` and `m` are both positive integers, we can conclude that `min(n, m)` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute. Therefore, we can adjust the states as follows:

State: **`t` is at least 1, `T` is 0, `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `m` is a positive integer and at least 2, `ans` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `b` is 2**
