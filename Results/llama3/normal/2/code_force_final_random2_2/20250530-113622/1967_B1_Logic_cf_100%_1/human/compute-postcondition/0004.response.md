Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `T` is 0, `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `m` is a positive integer and at least 2, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `b` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the result of the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)`, where `b` is 2. This means that `ans` is now equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4`, which is a more specific value than just `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
