Output State: **t is at least 1, T is 0, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, ans is equal to n, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `T` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The code reads a line from stdin, which contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m` respectively. The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `n`. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1 as one line has been read.
