The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is calculated as `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`.

Here, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, and `min(n, m)` is at least 2. The expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` calculates the integer division of `(n + b)` by `(b * b)` for each `b` in the range from 2 to `min(n, m)` (inclusive). The `sum` function then adds up these values.

Since `min(n, m)` is at least 2, the range of `b` will be at least 2. Therefore, the sum will include at least one term.

The value of `ans` will be the sum of `n` and the sum of these terms.

Output: **n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1)) (where n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, and min(n, m) is at least 2)**
