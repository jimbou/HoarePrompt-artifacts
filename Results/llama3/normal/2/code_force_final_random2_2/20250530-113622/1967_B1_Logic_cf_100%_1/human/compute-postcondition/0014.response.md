To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `b`, `n`, and `m`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `min(n, m)` is at least 2. Since `b` is initialized to 2, we need to ensure that `min(n, m)` is at least 2.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `T` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `m` is a positive integer and at least 2, `ans` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `b` is 2**
