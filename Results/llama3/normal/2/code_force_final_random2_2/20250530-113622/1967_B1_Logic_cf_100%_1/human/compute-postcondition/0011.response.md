Output: **t is at least 1, T is 0, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, ans is equal to n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1)), stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, b is min(n, m), and the value of ans which is equal to n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1)) is being printed**
