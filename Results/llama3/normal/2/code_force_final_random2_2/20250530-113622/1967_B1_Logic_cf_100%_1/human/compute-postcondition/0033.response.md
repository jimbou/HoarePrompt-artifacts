Output: **t is at least 2, T is 2, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, ans is equal to n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1)), stdin contains multiple test cases - 2, b is min(n, m), min(n, m) is at least 2, and the value of ans is printed which is equal to n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))**
