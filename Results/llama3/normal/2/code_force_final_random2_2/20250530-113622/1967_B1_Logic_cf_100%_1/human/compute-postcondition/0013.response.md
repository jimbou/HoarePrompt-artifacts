Output State: **t is at least 2, T is 1, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, ans is equal to n, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, b is min(n, m)**

The code snippet reads two values from stdin, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `m`, respectively. The value of `ans` is updated to be equal to `n`. The values of `t`, `T`, and `b` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains one less test case.
