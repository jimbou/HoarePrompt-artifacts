Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `T` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9 + (n + 4) // 16`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2, `b` is 4, `min(n, m)` is at least 5**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding the result of the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)`, where `b` is 4. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now a more complex expression involving `n`, but it is still a positive integer. The precondition that `min(n, m)` is at least 5 is still valid, and the values of `t`, `T`, `n`, `m`, and `b` are unchanged.
