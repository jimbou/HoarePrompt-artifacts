Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `T` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2, `b` is 3, `min(n, m)` is at least 4**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the additional term `(n + 3) // 9`, which is the result of the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` where `b` is 3. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `t`, `T`, `n`, `m`, and `min(n, m)` are still valid.
