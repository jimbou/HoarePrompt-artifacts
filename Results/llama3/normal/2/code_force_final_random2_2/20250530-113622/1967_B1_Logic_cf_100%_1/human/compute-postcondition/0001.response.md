To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `T` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), we can adjust its state to be at least 1.

State: **`t` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing two positive integers n, m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6), with one line already read, T is 0**
