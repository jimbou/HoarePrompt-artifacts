Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions:

1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
2. a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

The provided program attempts to solve this problem. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m` and initializes the answer `ans` to `n`. This is incorrect because the initial value of `ans` should be 0, not `n`. The correct initialization should be `ans = 0`.
3. The program then iterates over the range of `b` from 2 to `min(n, m) + 1`. This is correct because the problem statement guarantees that `b` is at least 2.
4. Inside the loop, the program calculates the value of `(n + b) // (b * b)` and adds it to `ans`. This is incorrect because the calculation is not correct. The correct calculation should be `(n + b - 1) // (b * b)`.

The correct program should be:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = 0
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b - 1) // (b * b)
        print(ans)
```

Correctness: **False**
