Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is:

5
4
2 4 1

The program outputs:

3 5 4 9

However, this output does not satisfy the condition x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} for all 2 <= i <= n. Specifically, 2 = 3 mod 5 is not true.

The issue with the program is that it simply subtracts the input values from the previous value in the array, without considering the modulo operation. This approach does not guarantee that the resulting array will satisfy the condition x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to take into account the modulo operation when constructing the array a. One possible approach is to use a recursive formula to calculate the values of a, based on the input values x.
