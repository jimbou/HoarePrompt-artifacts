Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains 2t lines of input: t lines with a single integer n (2 <= n <= 500) and t lines with n-1 integers x_2, ..., x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500)
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t = t - 1
    n = int(input())
    line = input('')
    T = list(map(int, line.split()))
    a = [1000]
    for i in range(1, n):
        a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])
    a = a[::-1]
    result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, n is an integer greater than 1, T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, a is a list containing n integers in reverse order, the last integer is 1000, and the rest of the integers are the result of subtracting the corresponding elements of T from the previous element of a, result is a string containing all the elements of the reversed list a, separated by spaces, i is n-1, stdin contains 2t-2 lines of input, and this is printed: a string containing all the elements of the reversed list a, separated by spaces, where the last integer is 1000, and the rest of the integers are the result of subtracting the corresponding elements of T from the previous element of a
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, n is an integer greater than 1, T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, a is a list containing n integers where the first integer is 1000 and the rest are calculated by subtracting the corresponding element from T from the previous element in a, result is a string containing all the elements of the list a, separated by spaces, i is n-1, stdin contains 2t-3 lines of input, and the result string containing all the elements of the list a, separated by spaces is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, n is an integer greater than 1, T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, a is a list containing n integers in reverse order, the first integer is the last element of the original list a, and the rest of the integers are the result of subtracting the corresponding element in T from the previous element in the original list a, result is a string containing all elements of the list a in reverse order, separated by spaces, i is n-1, stdin contains 2t-4 lines of input, and the string result containing all elements of the list a in reverse order, separated by spaces is being printed


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
