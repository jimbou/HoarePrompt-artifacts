Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing 4 integers where the first integer is 1000, the second integer is 1000 - T[0], the third integer is 1000 - T[0] - T[1], and the fourth integer is 1000 - T[0] - T[1] - T[2], `result` is a string containing all the elements of the reversed list `a`, separated by spaces, `i` is 3, stdin contains 2t-2 lines of input**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending a new element, which is the difference between the third element of `a` (1000 - T[0] - T[1]) and the third element of `T` (T[2]). The other variables remain unchanged.
