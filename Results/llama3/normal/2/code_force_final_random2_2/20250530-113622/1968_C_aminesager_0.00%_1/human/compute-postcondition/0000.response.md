The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The input contains multiple lines of input, where the first line contains a single integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). After reading the first line, the input contains t lines with a single integer n (2 <= n <= 500) and t lines with n-1 integers x_2, ..., x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains 2t lines of input: t lines with a single integer n (2 <= n <= 500) and t lines with n-1 integers x_2, ..., x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500)**
