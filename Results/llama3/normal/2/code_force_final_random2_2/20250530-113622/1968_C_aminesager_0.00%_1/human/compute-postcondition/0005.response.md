The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing two integers, the first integer is 1000 and the second integer is 1000 - T[0], `stdin` contains `2t-2` lines of input, `i` is 2**
