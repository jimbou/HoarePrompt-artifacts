Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, n is an integer between 2 and 500, T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, a is a list containing a single integer 1000, stdin contains 2t-2 lines of input: t-1 lines with a single integer n (2 <= n <= 500) and t-1 lines with n-1 integers x_2, ..., x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500)**

The first line decrements the value of `t` by 1, making it an integer between 0 and 10^4. The second line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, which is between 2 and 500. The third line reads a line of input and assigns it to `line`, which is not used anywhere else in the code. The fourth line assigns a list of `n-1` integers to `T`, where each integer is between 1 and 500. The fifth line assigns a list containing a single integer 1000 to `a`. The stdin now contains `2t-2` lines of input, with `t-1` lines having a single integer `n` and `t-1` lines having `n-1` integers `x_2, ..., x_n`.
