Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing n integers, the first integer is 1000 and the rest of the integers are the result of subtracting the corresponding element in `T` from the previous element in `a`, `result` is a string containing the first element of the list `a`, which is 1000, `i` is n-1, `stdin` contains 2t-4 lines of input.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `a` will contain `n` integers, where the first integer is 1000 and the rest of the integers are the result of subtracting the corresponding element in `T` from the previous element in `a`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, and the other variables will remain unchanged.
