According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, n is an integer greater than 1, T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, a is a list containing n integers where the first integer is 1000 and the rest are calculated by subtracting the corresponding element from T from the previous element in a, result is a string containing all the elements of the list a, separated by spaces, i is n-1, stdin contains 2t-3 lines of input, and the result string containing all the elements of the list a, separated by spaces is being printed**
