Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the result. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The function reads a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n-1 integers. It then calculates a list of n integers by subtracting the corresponding element in the input list from the previous element, and prints the resulting list in reverse order, separated by spaces. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point it terminates.**
