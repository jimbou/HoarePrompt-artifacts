Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and must be at least 2, `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing 2 integers, the first integer is 1000 and the second integer is 1000 - T[0], `result` is a string containing the first element of the list `a`, which is 1000, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains 2t-4 lines of input**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending a new integer, which is the result of subtracting the first element of `T` from the first element of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
