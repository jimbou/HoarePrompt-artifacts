Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} for all 2 <= i <= n, where x_i is the given array and a_i is the array to be found.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of elements in the array and the array itself. It then calculates the array a by subtracting the corresponding element in the input array from the previous element, starting from the second element. The array a is then reversed and printed.

The key insight here is that the program is using the fact that a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i implies that a_i = a_{i-1} - x_i + k*a_{i-1} for some integer k. By choosing k = 1, the program ensures that a_i is always less than or equal to 10^9, as required by the problem statement.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the desired output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
