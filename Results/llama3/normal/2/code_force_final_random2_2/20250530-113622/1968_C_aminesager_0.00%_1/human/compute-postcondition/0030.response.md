To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1 and must be at least 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 2 and must be at least 3, `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing 2 integers, the first integer is 1000 and the second integer is 1000 - T[0], `result` is a string containing the first element of the list `a`, which is 1000, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains 2t-4 lines of input**
