The `print(result)` statement will print a string containing all elements of the list `a` in reverse order, separated by spaces.

Since `a` is a list containing `n` integers, where the first integer is the last element of the original list `a`, and the rest of the integers are the result of subtracting the corresponding element in `T` from the previous element in the original list `a`, the output will be a string of `n` integers separated by spaces.

The exact values of the integers in the output cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `T` and the original list `a`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output a string of `n` integers in reverse order, separated by spaces.

Output: **a string of n integers in reverse order, separated by spaces (where n is the number of elements in the list a)**
