Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing 3 integers where the first integer is 1000, the second integer is 1000 - T[0], and the third integer is 1000 - T[0] - T[1], `result` is a string containing all the elements of the reversed list `a`, separated by spaces, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3, stdin contains 2t-2 lines of input**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending a new element, which is the difference between the second element of `a` and the second element of `T`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains 2t-2 lines of input.
