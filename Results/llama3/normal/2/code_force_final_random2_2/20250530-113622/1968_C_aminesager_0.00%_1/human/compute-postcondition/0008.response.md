Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing four integers, the first integer is 1000, the second integer is 1000 - T[0], the third integer is 1000 - T[0] - T[1], and the fourth integer is 1000 - T[0] - T[1] - T[2], `stdin` contains `2t-2` lines of input, `i` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending a new integer, which is the difference between the third element of `a` (i.e., `a[i - 1]`) and the third element of `T` (i.e., `T[i - 1]`). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
