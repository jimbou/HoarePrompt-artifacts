The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing 3 integers where the first integer is 1000, the second integer is 1000 - T[0], and the third integer is 1000 - T[0] - T[1], `result` is a string containing all the elements of the reversed list `a`, separated by spaces, `i` is 3, stdin contains 2t-2 lines of input**
