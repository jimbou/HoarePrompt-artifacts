Based on the initial state, the print statement will output the string `result`, which contains all the elements of the list `a`, separated by spaces.

The list `a` is constructed by starting with the first integer 1000, and then each subsequent integer is calculated by subtracting the corresponding element from the list `T` from the previous element in `a`. Since `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, and `a` has `n` integers, the last element of `a` will be the result of subtracting the last element of `T` from the second-to-last element of `a`.

Since `i` is `n-1`, it means that the last element of `a` has already been calculated and is included in the string `result`.

Therefore, the output will be a string containing `n` integers, separated by spaces, where the first integer is 1000, and each subsequent integer is the result of subtracting the corresponding element from `T` from the previous element in `a`.

Output: **1000 and n-1 integers, each calculated by subtracting the corresponding element from T from the previous element in a, separated by spaces**
