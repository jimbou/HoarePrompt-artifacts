You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 500). Each of the following t lines contains n-1 integers x_2, ..., x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500).
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        line = input('')
        
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        
        a = [1000]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])
        
        a = a[::-1]
        
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        
        print(result)
        
    #State: t is 0, n is an integer greater than 1, T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, a is a list containing n integers in reverse order, the first integer is the last element of the original list a, and the rest of the integers are the result of subtracting the corresponding element in T from the previous element in the original list a, result is a string containing all elements of the list a in reverse order, separated by spaces, i is n-1, stdin contains 0 lines of input, and the string result containing all elements of the list a in reverse order, separated by spaces is being printed.

```

Return Postconditions: t is 0, n is an integer greater than 1, T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, a is a list containing n integers in reverse order, the first integer is the last element of the original list a, and the rest of the integers are the result of subtracting the corresponding element in T from the previous element in the original list a, result is a string containing all elements of the list a in reverse order, separated by spaces, i is n-1, stdin contains 0 lines of input, and the string result containing all elements of the list a in reverse order, separated by spaces is being printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
