Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing two integers, the first integer is 1000 and the second integer is 1000 - T[0], `stdin` contains `2t-2` lines of input, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending a new integer, which is the result of subtracting the first element of `T` from the first element of `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
