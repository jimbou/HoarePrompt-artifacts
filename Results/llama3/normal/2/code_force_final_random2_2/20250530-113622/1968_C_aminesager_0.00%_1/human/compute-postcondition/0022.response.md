Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing n integers where the first integer is 1000 and the rest are calculated by subtracting the corresponding element from `T` from the previous element in `a`, `result` is a string containing all the elements of the reversed list `a`, separated by spaces, `i` is n-1, stdin contains 2t-3 lines of input**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will contain `n` integers, where the first integer is 1000 and the rest are calculated by subtracting the corresponding element from `T` from the previous element in `a`. The `result` string will contain all the elements of the reversed list `a`, separated by spaces. The value of `i` will be `n-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `n-1` times. The values of `t`, `n`, `T`, and stdin remain unchanged.
