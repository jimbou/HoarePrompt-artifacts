To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop. The other variables, `t`, `T`, `a`, and `result`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 2 and must be at least 3, `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing 3 integers, the first integer is 1000, the second integer is 1000 - T[0], and the third integer is 1000 - T[0] - T[1], `result` is a string containing the first element of the list `a`, which is 1000, `i` is 3, `stdin` contains 2t-4 lines of input.**
