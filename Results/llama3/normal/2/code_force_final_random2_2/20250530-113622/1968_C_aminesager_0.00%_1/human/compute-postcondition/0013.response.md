The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, n is an integer greater than 1, T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, a is a list containing n integers in reverse order, the last integer is 1000, and the rest of the integers are the result of subtracting the corresponding elements of T from the previous element of a, result is a string containing all the elements of the reversed list a, separated by spaces, i is n-1, stdin contains 2t-2 lines of input, and this is printed: a string containing all the elements of the reversed list a, separated by spaces, where the last integer is 1000, and the rest of the integers are the result of subtracting the corresponding elements of T from the previous element of a**
