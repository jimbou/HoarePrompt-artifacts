Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 2 and must be at least 3, `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing 3 integers, the first integer is 1000, the second integer is 1000 - T[0], and the third integer is 1000 - T[0] - T[1], `result` is a string containing the first element of the list `a`, which is 1000, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains 2t-4 lines of input.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending a new integer, which is the result of subtracting `T[i - 1]` from `a[i - 1]`. The value of `i` remains the same, and the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains 2t-4 lines of input.
