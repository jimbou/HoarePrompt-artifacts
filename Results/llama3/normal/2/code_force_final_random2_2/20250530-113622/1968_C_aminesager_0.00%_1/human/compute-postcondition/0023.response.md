Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, n is an integer greater than 1, T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, a is a list containing n integers where the first integer is 1000 and the rest are calculated by subtracting the corresponding element from T from the previous element in a, result is a string containing all the elements of the list a, separated by spaces, i is n-1, stdin contains 2t-3 lines of input**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line reverses the list `a` using slicing, and the second line joins the elements of the reversed list `a` into a string `result`, separated by spaces. 

The initial state of `a` is a list containing `n` integers, where the first integer is 1000 and the rest are calculated by subtracting the corresponding element from `T` from the previous element in `a`. After the first line of code, `a` is reversed, but its elements remain the same. 

The second line of code creates a string `result` containing all the elements of the reversed list `a`, separated by spaces. Since `a` was reversed in the previous line, `result` will contain the elements of the original list `a` in reverse order, separated by spaces. 

No other variables are affected by the code snippet. The value of `t` remains an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` remains an integer greater than 1, `T` remains a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, and `i` remains `n-1`. The state of `stdin` also remains unchanged, containing `2t-3` lines of input.
