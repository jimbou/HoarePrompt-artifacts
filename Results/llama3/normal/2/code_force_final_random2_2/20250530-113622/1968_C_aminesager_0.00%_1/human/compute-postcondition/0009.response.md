Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing `n` integers, the first integer is 1000, and the rest of the integers are the result of subtracting the corresponding elements of `T` from the previous element of `a`, `stdin` contains `2t-2` lines of input, `i` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, `n` is still greater than 1, `T` is still a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is now a list containing `n` integers, where the first integer is 1000, and each subsequent integer is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `T` from the previous element of `a`. The contents of `stdin` remain unchanged, and the loop counter `i` has reached `n-1`.
