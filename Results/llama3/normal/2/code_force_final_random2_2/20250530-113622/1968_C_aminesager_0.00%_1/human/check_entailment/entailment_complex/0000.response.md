Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and then reads `n-1` integers into the list `T`.
3. It initializes the list `a` with a single element `1000`, which is within the allowed range of `1` to `10^9`.
4. It then iterates over the range `1` to `n` (exclusive) and appends elements to the list `a` by subtracting the corresponding element in `T` from the previous element in `a`. This ensures that the condition `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` is satisfied for all `2 <= i <= n`.
5. After constructing the list `a`, it reverses the list using slicing (`a = a[::-1]`) to get the correct order.
6. Finally, it prints the resulting list `a` in reverse order, separated by spaces, which is the required output format.

The execution states of the program provided as comments confirm that the program behaves as expected. The state of the program before the function call shows that the input is read correctly, and the state after the function call shows that the output is printed correctly.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, I conclude that the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
