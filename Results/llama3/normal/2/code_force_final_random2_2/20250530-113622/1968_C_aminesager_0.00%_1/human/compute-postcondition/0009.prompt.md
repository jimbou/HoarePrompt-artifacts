Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, n is an integer between 2 and 500, T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, a is a list containing a single integer 1000, stdin contains 2t-2 lines of input: t-1 lines with a single integer n (2 <= n <= 500) and t-1 lines with n-1 integers x_2, ..., x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing two integers, the first integer is 1000 and the second integer is 1000 - T[0], `stdin` contains `2t-2` lines of input, `i` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing three integers, the first integer is 1000, the second integer is 1000 - T[0], and the third integer is 1000 - T[0] - T[1], `stdin` contains `2t-2` lines of input, `i` is 2

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing four integers, the first integer is 1000, the second integer is 1000 - T[0], the third integer is 1000 - T[0] - T[1], and the fourth integer is 1000 - T[0] - T[1] - T[2], `stdin` contains `2t-2` lines of input, `i` is 3




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
