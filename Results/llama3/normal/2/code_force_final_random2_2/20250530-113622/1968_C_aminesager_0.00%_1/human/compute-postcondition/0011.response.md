The `print(result)` statement will print a string containing all the elements of the reversed list `a`, separated by spaces.

Since `a` is a list containing `n` integers in reverse order, the last integer is 1000, and the rest of the integers are the result of subtracting the corresponding elements of `T` from the previous element of `a`, the output will be a string of `n` integers separated by spaces.

The first `n-1` integers in the string will be the result of subtracting the corresponding elements of `T` from the previous element of `a`, and the last integer will be 1000.

Since the exact values of `T` and `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the integers in the string. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output a string of `n` integers separated by spaces, where the first `n-1` integers are the result of subtracting the corresponding elements of `T` from the previous element of `a`, and the last integer is 1000.

Output: **a string of n integers separated by spaces, where the first n-1 integers are the result of subtracting the corresponding elements of T from the previous element of a, and the last integer is 1000**
