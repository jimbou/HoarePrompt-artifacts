To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing three integers, the first integer is 1000, the second integer is 1000 - T[0], and the third integer is 1000 - T[0] - T[1], `stdin` contains `2t-2` lines of input, `i` is 3**
