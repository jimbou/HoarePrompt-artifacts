Output State: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing n integers where the first integer is 1000 and the remaining integers are the result of subtracting the corresponding element in `T` from the previous element in `a`, `result` is a string containing all the elements of the reversed list `a`, separated by spaces, `i` is n-1, stdin contains 2t-3 lines of input.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `a` will contain `n` integers, where each integer is the result of subtracting the corresponding element in `T` from the previous element in `a`, starting from 1000. The `result` string will contain all the elements of the reversed list `a`, separated by spaces. The value of `i` will be `n-1`, and the other variables will remain unchanged.
