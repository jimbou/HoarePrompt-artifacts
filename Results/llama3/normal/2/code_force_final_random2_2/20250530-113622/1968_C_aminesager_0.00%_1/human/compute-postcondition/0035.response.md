Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, n is an integer greater than 1, T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, a is a list containing n integers in reverse order, the first integer is the last element of the original list a, and the rest of the integers are the result of subtracting the corresponding element in T from the previous element in the original list a, result is a string containing all elements of the list a in reverse order, separated by spaces, i is n-1, stdin contains 2t-4 lines of input.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` also remains the same as it is not affected by the code. The list `T` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `a` is reversed, so the first element is now the last element of the original list, and the rest of the elements are the result of subtracting the corresponding element in `T` from the previous element in the original list `a`. The string `result` now contains all elements of the list `a` in reverse order, separated by spaces. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The state of `stdin` remains the same as it is not affected by the code.
