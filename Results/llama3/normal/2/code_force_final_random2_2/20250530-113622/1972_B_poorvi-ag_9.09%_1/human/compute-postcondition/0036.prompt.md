Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than or equal to 0, i is t-1, stdin is empty, n is an integer, arr is a string. If n is even, results is a list containing the string 'no' repeated t times. If n is odd, results is a list containing the string 'yes' if the number of 'U' characters in arr is greater than the number of 'D' characters, otherwise results is a list containing the string 'no' repeated t times.
Code of the loop:
for i in results:
    print(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `results` is not empty, and the value of `i` which is 0 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the next element in the `results` list, `stdin` is empty, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `results` is a list with at least one more element, and the next element in the `results` list which is `i` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the next element in the `results` list (after the current one), `stdin` is empty, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `results` is a list with at least one more element, and the next element in the `results` list which is `i` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
