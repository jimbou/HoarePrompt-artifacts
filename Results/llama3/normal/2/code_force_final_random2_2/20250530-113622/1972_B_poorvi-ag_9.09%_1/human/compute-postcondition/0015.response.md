Output State: **t is greater than 1, i is 1, n is an integer, arr is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, if n is even, results is a list containing the string 'no'. If n is odd, results is a list containing the string 'yes' if the number of 'U' characters in arr is greater than the number of 'D' characters, otherwise results is a list containing the string 'no' and 'yes'**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but the list 'results' now contains an additional string 'yes'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
