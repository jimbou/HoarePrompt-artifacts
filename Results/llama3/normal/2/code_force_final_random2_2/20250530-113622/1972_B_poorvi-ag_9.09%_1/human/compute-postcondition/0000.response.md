Output State: **t is an integer, results is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the first input to `t`. Since the first input is a positive integer, `t` becomes a positive integer. The second line initializes an empty list `results`. No other variables are affected. The value of `t` is used to determine the number of test cases, and `results` is used to store the results of each test case. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and the first input is consumed, leaving multiple test cases minus one.
