Output State: **t is greater than 2, i is 2, n is an integer, arr is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four. If n is even, results is a list containing the string 'no' or 'no', 'no', 'no'. If n is odd, results is a list containing the string 'yes' if the number of 'U' characters in arr is greater than the number of 'D' characters, otherwise results is a list containing the string 'no' or 'no', 'no', 'no'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t remains greater than 2, the value of i remains 2, the value of n remains an integer, the value of arr remains a string, and the number of test cases in stdin remains multiple minus four. The list results now contains an additional 'no' string. If n is even, results contains 'no' or 'no', 'no', 'no'. If n is odd, results contains 'yes' if the number of 'U' characters in arr is greater than the number of 'D' characters, otherwise it contains 'no' or 'no', 'no', 'no'.
