Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, if `n` is even, `results` is a list containing the string 'no', 'no'. If `n` is odd, `results` is a list containing the string 'yes' if the number of 'U' characters in `arr` is greater than the number of 'D' characters, otherwise `results` is a list containing the string 'no', 'no'**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 1, `i` is still 1, `n` is still an integer, and `arr` is still a string. The number of test cases in stdin has not changed. The list `results` now contains an additional 'no' string. If `n` is even, `results` contains two 'no' strings. If `n` is odd, the condition for 'yes' or 'no' in `results` is still dependent on the number of 'U' and 'D' characters in `arr`, but an additional 'no' string has been appended to `results`.
