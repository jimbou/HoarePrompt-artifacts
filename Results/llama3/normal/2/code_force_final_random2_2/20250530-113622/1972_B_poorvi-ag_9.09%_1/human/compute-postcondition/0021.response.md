Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four. If `n` is even, `results` is a list containing the string 'no' or 'no', 'no', 'no'. If `n` is odd, `results` is a list containing the string 'yes' if the number of 'U' characters in `arr` is greater than the number of 'D' characters, otherwise `results` is a list containing the string 'no' or 'no', 'no', 'no'.**

In this output state, the value of `results` has been updated by appending the string 'no' to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `results` is still dependent on whether `n` is even or odd, and the number of 'U' and 'D' characters in `arr`.
