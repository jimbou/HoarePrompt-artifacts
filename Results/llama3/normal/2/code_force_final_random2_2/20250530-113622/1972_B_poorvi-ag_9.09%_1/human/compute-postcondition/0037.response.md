Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n and a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D" characters. It then determines for each test case whether the number of "U" characters is greater than the number of "D" characters if n is odd, and prints "yes" if true, otherwise prints "no". If n is even, it always prints "no". The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input, at which point it has printed the results for all test cases.**
