To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.

The loop head is `for i in results:`, which means the loop iterates over the elements of the `results` list. The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`, which is the next element in the `results` list.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the `results` list. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the next element in the `results` list, and `results` has at least one more element.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to move to the next element in the `results` list. Therefore, `i` should be updated to the next element in the list.

The other variables (`t`, `stdin`, `n`, and `arr`) are not involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Here is the updated state:

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the next element in the `results` list (after the current one), `stdin` is empty, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `results` is a list with at least one more element**
