The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, arr is a string. If n is even, results is a list containing the string 'no'. If n is odd, results is a list containing the string 'yes' if the number of 'U' characters in arr is greater than the number of 'D' characters, otherwise results is a list containing the string 'no'.**
