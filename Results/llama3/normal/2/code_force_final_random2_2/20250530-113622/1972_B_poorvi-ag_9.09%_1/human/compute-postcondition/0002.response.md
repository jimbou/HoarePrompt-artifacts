Output State: **t is greater than 0, i is 0, results is an empty list, n is an integer, arr is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**

The code snippet reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `n`. It then reads a string from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `arr`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `results` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The number of test cases in the standard input is reduced by two as two inputs are read.
