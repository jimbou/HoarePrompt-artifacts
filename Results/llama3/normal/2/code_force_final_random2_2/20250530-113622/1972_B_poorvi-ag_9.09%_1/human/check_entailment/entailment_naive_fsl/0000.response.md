Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine who will win the game. The condition `elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):` is not sufficient to determine the winner. 

For example, consider the case where `n = 5` and `arr = 'UDUDU'`. In this case, the program will output `'yes'`, indicating that Alice will win, but this is not necessarily true. The actual outcome of the game depends on the specific moves made by Alice and Bob, not just the number of 'U's and 'D's.

A correct solution would need to take into account the specific moves made by each player and the resulting state of the coins after each move. The program would need to simulate the game and determine the winner based on the final state of the coins.
