Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the last element in the `results` list, `stdin` is empty, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `results` is not empty, and the last element in the `results` list which is `i` has been printed**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop variable `i` has reached the last element in the `results` list, and this last element has been printed. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
