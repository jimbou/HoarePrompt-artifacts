Output State: **t is greater than 2, i is 2, n is an integer, arr is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four. If n is even, results is a list containing the string 'no' or 'no', 'no'. If n is odd, results is a list containing the string 'yes' if the number of 'U' characters in arr is greater than the number of 'D' characters, otherwise results is a list containing the string 'no' or 'no', 'no', 'yes'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t is still greater than 2, i is still 2, n is still an integer, and arr is still a string. The number of test cases in stdin has not changed. The list results has been updated to include the string 'yes' in addition to its previous values. If n is even, results still contains 'no' or 'no', 'no'. If n is odd, results now contains 'yes' in addition to its previous values, which were 'yes' if the number of 'U' characters in arr is greater than the number of 'D' characters, or 'no' or 'no', 'no' otherwise.
