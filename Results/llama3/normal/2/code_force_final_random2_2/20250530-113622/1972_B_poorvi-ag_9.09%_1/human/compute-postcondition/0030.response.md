To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.

The loop head is `for i in results:`. This means that the loop will iterate over the elements of the `results` list, assigning each element to the variable `i` in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `i` is 0, which means that the first element of the `results` list has already been processed. To execute the loop again, we need to adjust the state of `i` and `results`.

Since `i` is an element of the `results` list, we can assume that the next element in the list will be assigned to `i` in the next iteration. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `i` to be the next element in the `results` list.

As for `results`, since we have already processed the first element, we can assume that the list still contains at least one more element. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `results` to be a list with at least one more element.

The other variables `t`, `stdin`, `n`, and `arr` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Here is the updated state:

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the next element in the `results` list, `stdin` is empty, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `results` is a list with at least one more element**
