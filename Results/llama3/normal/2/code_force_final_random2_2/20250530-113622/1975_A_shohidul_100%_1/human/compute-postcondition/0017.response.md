Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is false, `i` is 1, `new` is a slice of list `a` starting from index `i`, `check_all_new` is true if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, `new_all` is true if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 0, the value of `_` is still 0, the value of `n` is still greater than 1, the value of `a` is still a list of integers, the value of `check_all` is still false, the value of `i` is still 1, the value of `new` is still a slice of list `a` starting from index `i`, the value of `check_all_new` is still true if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, and the value of `new_all` is still true if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order. Additionally, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
