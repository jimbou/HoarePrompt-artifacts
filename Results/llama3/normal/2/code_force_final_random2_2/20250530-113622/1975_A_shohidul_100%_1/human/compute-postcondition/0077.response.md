Postcondition: **The program has checked the conditions of the list `a` and its sublist `new`. If both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are true, the program prints 'YES' and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all` remain unchanged throughout the execution of the if-else block.**
