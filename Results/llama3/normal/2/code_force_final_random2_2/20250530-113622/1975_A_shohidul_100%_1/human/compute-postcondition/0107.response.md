Postcondition: ***_t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean value, i is 2, n is at least 3. If a[i - 1] > a[i], the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of whether check_all_new and new_all are true or not, and new is a slice of list a starting from index 2, check_all_new is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in new are less than or equal to a[0], new_all is a boolean value indicating whether new is sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
