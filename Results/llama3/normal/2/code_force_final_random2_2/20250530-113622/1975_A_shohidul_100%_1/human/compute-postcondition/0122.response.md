Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It checks if the list is sorted in ascending order. If the list is sorted, it prints 'YES'. If the list is not sorted, it checks if the unsorted part of the list (from the first pair of elements that are in the wrong order to the end) is sorted and if the first element of the unsorted part is not greater than the first element of the original list. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**
