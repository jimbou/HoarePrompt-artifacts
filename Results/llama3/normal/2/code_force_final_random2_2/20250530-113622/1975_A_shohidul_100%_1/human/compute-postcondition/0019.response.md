Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is false, `i` is 1. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then a new slice of list `a` starting from index `i` is created and checked. If all elements in this new slice are less than or equal to `a[0]` and in non-decreasing order, 'YES' is printed and the innermost loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the innermost loop or if statement is exited. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, no action is taken.***
