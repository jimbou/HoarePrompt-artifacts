Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order**

Here's a description of the final state:

The value of `t` remains unchanged as an integer greater than 0. The value of `_` also remains unchanged as 0. 

The first line of the code assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. 

The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `a`. 

The third line assigns a boolean value to `check_all`, indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order. This is determined by checking if each element in the list is less than or equal to the next element. 

Note that the input is consumed by the `input()` function, so the input state is not included in the final output state.
