Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in ascending order, `i` is 3, `new` is a list of integers from index 3 to the end of list `a`, `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the first element of `a`, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `new` is sorted in ascending order, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and 'YES' has been printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we exit the innermost loop or if statement. The 'YES' message has already been printed.
