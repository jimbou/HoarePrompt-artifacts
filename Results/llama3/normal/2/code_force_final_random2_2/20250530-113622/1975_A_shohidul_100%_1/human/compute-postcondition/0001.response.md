To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the variable `_` (although `_` is a throwaway variable, its value is still determined by the range of `t`).

According to the code, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), we can adjust its state to be greater than 0.

The variable `_` will take on the values from 0 to `t-1` during the loop iterations. Since we want the loop to execute, we can set `_` to 0, which is the first value it will take on.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0**
