Postcondition: **_t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether the list a is sorted in ascending order. If check_all is true, 'YES' is printed. If check_all is false, then if a[i - 1] > a[i] for any i in range(1, n), and both check_all_new and new_all are true, 'YES' has been printed, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If a[i - 1] is not greater than a[i] for all i in range(1, n), then no action is taken.**
