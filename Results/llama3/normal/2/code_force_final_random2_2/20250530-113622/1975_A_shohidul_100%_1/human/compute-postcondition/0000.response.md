Output State: **`t` is an integer (2 <= t <= 50), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of an integer from the input, which is between 2 and 50 (inclusive). The stdin contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been read and processed, so the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one. The remaining test cases still contain two inputs each: an integer n (between 2 and 50) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (each between 1 and 10^6).
