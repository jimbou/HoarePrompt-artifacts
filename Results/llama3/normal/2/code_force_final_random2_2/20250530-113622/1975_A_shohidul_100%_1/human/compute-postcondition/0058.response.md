Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether the list a is sorted in ascending order, i is 1. If a[i - 1] > a[i], then we check if all elements in the slice of list a starting from index i are less than or equal to a[0] and if the slice of list a starting from index i is sorted in ascending order. If both conditions are true, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
