To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n`. If `n` is less than 2, the loop will not execute.

Before the loop starts, `_t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, and `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in ascending order. However, these variables are not in the loop head, so we cannot adjust their states.

The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be 1, and `n`, which should be at least 2.

State: **`_t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is a boolean value, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2**
