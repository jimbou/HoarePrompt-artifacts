According to the code, the loop will execute again if _ is less than t. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, t is an integer greater than 1. So for the loop to execute again _ must be increased by 1 and _ is 2 and t must be greater than 2.
State: **_t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether the list a is sorted in ascending order. If check_all is true, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, i is set to n**
