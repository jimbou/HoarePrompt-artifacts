Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in ascending order, `i` is 3. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, the program prints 'YES' and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are true, otherwise, it only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all` remain unchanged throughout the execution of the if-else block.***
