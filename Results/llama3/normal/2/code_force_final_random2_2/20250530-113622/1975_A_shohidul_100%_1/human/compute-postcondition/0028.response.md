Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is greater than 2, a is a list of integers, check_all is false, i is 2, new is a slice of a starting from index 2, check_all_new is true if all elements in new are less than or equal to a[0], new_all is true if all elements in new are in non-decreasing order. If both check_all_new and new_all are true, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
