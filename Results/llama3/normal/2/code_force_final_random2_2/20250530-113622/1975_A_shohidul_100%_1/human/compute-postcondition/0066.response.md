Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 2, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether the list a is sorted in ascending order, i is 2, new is a list of integers, check_all_new is a boolean value indicating whether the first element of a is greater than or equal to all elements in new, new_all is a boolean value indicating whether new is sorted in ascending order, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The variable t is still an integer greater than 1, _ is still 1, n is still an integer greater than 2, a is still a list of integers, check_all is still a boolean value indicating whether the list a is sorted in ascending order, i is still 2, new is still a list of integers, check_all_new is still a boolean value indicating whether the first element of a is greater than or equal to all elements in new, new_all is still a boolean value indicating whether new is sorted in ascending order.
