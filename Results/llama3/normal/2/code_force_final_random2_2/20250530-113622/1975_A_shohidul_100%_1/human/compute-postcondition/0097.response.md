Postcondition: ***_t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean value, i is 1, n is at least 2. If the value of a at index i-1 is greater than the value of a at index i, then if both check_all_new and new_all are true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, either check_all_new is false or new_all is false, 'NO' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the value of a at index i-1 is not greater than the value of a at index i, then nothing happens.***
