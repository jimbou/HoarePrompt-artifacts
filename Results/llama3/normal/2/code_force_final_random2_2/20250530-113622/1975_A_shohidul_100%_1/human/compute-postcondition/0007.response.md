To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is false, `i` is 1**
