Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order, and check_all is false
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all_new and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is false, `i` is 1. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then a new slice of list `a` starting from index `i` is created and checked. If all elements in this new slice are less than or equal to `a[0]` and in non-decreasing order, 'YES' is printed and the innermost loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the innermost loop or if statement is exited. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is greater than 2, a is a list of integers, check_all is false, i is 2. If a[i - 1] > a[i], a new slice of a starting from index 2 is created and checked. If all elements in the new slice are less than or equal to a[0] and in non-decreasing order, 'YES' is printed and the innermost loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and the innermost loop or if statement is exited. If a[i - 1] is not greater than a[i], no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is false, `i` is 3. If the element at index `i-1` in list `a` is greater than the element at index `i`, a new list `new` is created from index 3 to the end of list `a`, and two conditions `check_all_new` and `new_all` are checked. If both conditions are true, 'YES' is printed and the innermost loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the innermost loop or if statement is exited without printing 'YES'. If the element at index `i-1` in list `a` is not greater than the element at index `i`, no action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
