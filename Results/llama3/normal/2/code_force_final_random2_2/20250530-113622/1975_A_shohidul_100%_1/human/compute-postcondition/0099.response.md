Output State: **_t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean value, i is 2, n is at least 3, new is a slice of list a starting from index 2, check_all_new is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in new are less than or equal to a[0], new_all is a boolean value indicating whether new is sorted in ascending order.**

In this output state, the values of `_t`, `_`, `a`, `check_all`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The new variables `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all` are introduced. `new` is a slice of the list `a` starting from index `i` (which is 2), `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the first element of `a`, and `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the elements in `new` are sorted in ascending order.
