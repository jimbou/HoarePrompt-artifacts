Output: **_t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean value, i is 1, n is at least 2, new is a slice of list a starting from index i, check_all_new is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in new are less than or equal to a[0], new_all is a boolean value indicating whether the slice of list a starting from index i is sorted in ascending order. The current values of check_all_new and new_all are both true, indicating that all elements in new are less than or equal to a[0] and the slice of list a starting from index i is sorted in ascending order, and 'YES' is printed**
