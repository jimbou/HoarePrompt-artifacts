Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by swapping its prefix and suffix. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. It first checks if the array is already sorted in ascending order. If it is, it prints 'YES'.

2. If the array is not sorted, it finds the first pair of elements that are in the wrong order. It then checks if the unsorted part of the array (from the first pair of elements that are in the wrong order to the end) is sorted. 

3. It also checks if the first element of the unsorted part is not greater than the first element of the original array. 

4. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program's logic is sound and it correctly handles all possible cases. 

Correctness: **True**
