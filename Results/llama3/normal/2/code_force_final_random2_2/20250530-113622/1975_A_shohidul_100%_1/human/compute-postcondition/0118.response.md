Output State: *_t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean value, i is n-1, n is an integer, new is a slice of list a starting from index n-1, check_all_new is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in new are less than or equal to a[0], new_all is a boolean value indicating whether new is sorted in ascending order. If a[i - 1] > a[i] at any point during the loop execution, then if both check_all_new and new_all are true, 'YES' has been printed, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If a[i - 1] is not greater than a[i] at any point during the loop execution, then no action is taken.


In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will iterate until it reaches the second last element in the list 'a' (i.e., i = n-1). If at any point during the loop execution, the current element is greater than the next element, the loop will check if all elements from the current index to the end of the list are less than or equal to the first element of the list and if the sublist from the current index to the end is sorted in ascending order. If both conditions are true, it will print 'YES' and exit the loop. If not, it will print 'NO' and exit the loop. If the current element is not greater than the next element at any point during the loop execution, the loop will simply iterate through the list without taking any action.
