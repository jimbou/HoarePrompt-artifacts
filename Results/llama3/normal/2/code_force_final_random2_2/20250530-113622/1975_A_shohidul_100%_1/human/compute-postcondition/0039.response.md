Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is false, `i` is 3. If the element at index `i-1` in list `a` is greater than the element at index `i`, a new list `new` is created from index 3 to the end of list `a`, and two conditions `check_all_new` and `new_all` are checked. If both conditions are true, 'YES' is printed and the innermost loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the innermost loop or if statement is exited without printing 'YES'. If the element at index `i-1` in list `a` is not greater than the element at index `i`, no action is taken.**
