Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in ascending order, `i` is 2. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then 'YES' has been printed if the first element of `a` is greater than or equal to all elements in a new list and the new list is sorted in ascending order. In all cases, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
