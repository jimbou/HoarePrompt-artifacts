Postcondition: ***_t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean value, i is 1, n is at least 2, new is a slice of list a starting from index i. If both check_all_new and new_all are true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, either check_all_new is false or new_all is false, 'NO' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
