Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean value, i is 3, n is at least 3, new is a slice of list a starting from index 3, check_all_new is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in new are less than or equal to a[0], new_all is a boolean value indicating whether new is sorted in ascending order. If a[i - 1] > a[i], then if both check_all_new and new_all are true, 'YES' has been printed, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If a[i - 1] is not greater than a[i], then no action is taken.***
