Output State: **_ is t, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether the list a is sorted in ascending order. If check_all is true, 'YES' is printed. If check_all is false, then if a[i - 1] > a[i] for any i in range(1, n), and both check_all_new and new_all are true, 'YES' has been printed, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If a[i - 1] is not greater than a[i] for all i in range(1, n), then no action is taken.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the loop counter `_` will be equal to the initial value of `t`, which is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 50. The variables `n` and `a` will still be integers and a list of integers, respectively, as they are not modified by the loop. The variable `check_all` will be a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in ascending order. If `check_all` is true, 'YES' will be printed. If `check_all` is false, then if there exists an `i` in range(1, n) such that `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, and both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are true, 'YES' will be printed, and the most internal loop or if statement will be exited. If no such `i` exists, then no action will be taken.
