Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether the list a is sorted in ascending order**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `_` also remains the same, which is 1. The value of `n` is updated to the integer value read from the input. The list `a` is updated to the list of integers read from the input, split by spaces. The variable `check_all` is assigned a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in ascending order. This is determined by the `all` function, which checks if all elements in the list satisfy the condition `a[i - 1] <= a[i]` for `i` ranging from 1 to `n`. If all elements satisfy this condition, `check_all` is `True`, otherwise it is `False`.
