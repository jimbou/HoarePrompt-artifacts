Output State: **_t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean value, i is 3, n is at least 3, new is a slice of list a starting from index 3, check_all_new is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in new are less than or equal to a[0], new_all is a boolean value indicating whether new is sorted in ascending order**

The code snippet modifies the values of `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all`. The first line reassigns the value of `new` to be a slice of list `a` starting from index `i`, which is 3. The second line calculates the value of `check_all_new` by checking if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`. The third line calculates the value of `new_all` by checking if `new` is sorted in ascending order. The values of `_t`, `_`, `a`, `check_all`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
