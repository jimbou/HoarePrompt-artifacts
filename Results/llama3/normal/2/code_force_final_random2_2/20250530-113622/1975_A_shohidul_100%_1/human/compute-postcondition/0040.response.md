Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is false, `i` is `n`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` remains an integer greater than 0, `_` remains 0, `n` remains an integer, `a` remains a list of integers, and `check_all` remains false. The loop variable `i` has reached the value of `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
