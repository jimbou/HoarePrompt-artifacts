Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is [3, 1, 4, 1, 5], the program will output 'NO', but the correct output should be 'NO' because the array cannot become non-decreasing after performing the operation any number of times.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to all elements in the suffix, but it does not check if the suffix is non-decreasing. In the example above, the suffix [4, 1, 5] is not non-decreasing, so the program should output 'NO'.

To fix this issue, the program should also check if the suffix is non-decreasing. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])
                    new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])
                    if check_all_new and new_all:
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break
            else:
                print('NO')
```

In this corrected version, if the program does not find a suffix that is non-decreasing and has the first element of the original array greater than or equal to all elements in the suffix, it will output 'NO'.
