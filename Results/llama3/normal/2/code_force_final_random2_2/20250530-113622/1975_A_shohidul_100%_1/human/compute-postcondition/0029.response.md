Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is greater than 2, a is a list of integers, check_all is false, i is 2. If a[i - 1] > a[i], a new slice of a starting from index 2 is created and checked. If all elements in the new slice are less than or equal to a[0] and in non-decreasing order, 'YES' is printed and the innermost loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and the innermost loop or if statement is exited. If a[i - 1] is not greater than a[i], no action is taken.***
