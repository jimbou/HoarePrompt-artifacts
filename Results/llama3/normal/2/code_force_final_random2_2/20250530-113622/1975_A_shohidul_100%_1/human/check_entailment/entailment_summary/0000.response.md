Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by swapping its prefix and suffix. 

The program first checks if the array is already sorted. If it is, it prints 'YES'. If the array is not sorted, it finds the first pair of elements that are in the wrong order and checks if the rest of the array (from that point to the end) is sorted. It also checks if the first element of the unsorted part is not greater than the first element of the original array. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES', indicating that the array can be sorted by swapping its prefix and suffix. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and does not contain any logical errors.

Correctness: **True**
