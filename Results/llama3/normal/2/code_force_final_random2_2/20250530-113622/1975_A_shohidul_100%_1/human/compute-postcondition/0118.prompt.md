Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether the list a is sorted in ascending order.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all_new and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *_t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean value, i is 1, n is at least 2. If the value of a at index i-1 is greater than the value of a at index i, then if both check_all_new and new_all are true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, either check_all_new is false or new_all is false, 'NO' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the value of a at index i-1 is not greater than the value of a at index i, then nothing happens.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *_t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean value, i is 2, n is at least 3. If a[i - 1] > a[i], the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of whether check_all_new and new_all are true or not, and new is a slice of list a starting from index 2, check_all_new is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in new are less than or equal to a[0], new_all is a boolean value indicating whether new is sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean value, i is 3, n is at least 3, new is a slice of list a starting from index 3, check_all_new is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in new are less than or equal to a[0], new_all is a boolean value indicating whether new is sorted in ascending order. If a[i - 1] > a[i], then if both check_all_new and new_all are true, 'YES' has been printed, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If a[i - 1] is not greater than a[i], then no action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
