Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, case is the second test case in the list, results is a list containing the beautiful_count of the first test case, n is the first parameter of the second test case, x is the second parameter of the second test case, y is the third parameter of the second test case, a is the array of the second test case that must have at least 2 elements, num is the second element in the list a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of (x - mod_x) divided by x, required_mod_y is mod_y, freq is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple (mod_x, mod_y) and the value is the previous value of freq[mod_x, mod_y] plus 1, and beautiful_count is equal to the previous value of beautiful_count plus the value of freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y].**

In this final state, the values of `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` are calculated based on the values of `num`, `x`, and `y`. The dictionary `freq` is updated with a new key-value pair, where the key is a tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` and the value is the previous value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` plus 1. The value of `beautiful_count` is also updated by adding the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
