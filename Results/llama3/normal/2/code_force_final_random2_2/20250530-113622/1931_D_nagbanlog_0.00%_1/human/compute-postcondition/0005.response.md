To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` has at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `a` to have at least one element.

State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, case is the first test case in the list, results is an empty list, n is the first parameter of the first test case, x is the second parameter of the first test case, y is the third parameter of the first test case, a is the array of the first test case that must have at least 1 element, freq is an empty dictionary, beautiful_count is 0, num is the first element in a, and this is printed: "Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a]"**
