Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `case` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing the beautiful_count of the first test case, `n` is the first parameter of the second test case, `x` is the second parameter of the second test case, `y` is the third parameter of the second test case, `a` is the array of the second test case that must have at least 1 element, `freq` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple (required_mod_x, required_mod_y), `beautiful_count` is equal to the previous value of `beautiful_count` plus the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `mod_x` is the remainder of the first element in the list `a` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of the first element in the list `a` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, "Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a]" is printed, `num` is the first element in the list `a`, and this is printed: "Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y]".**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `beautiful_count` has been updated by adding the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
