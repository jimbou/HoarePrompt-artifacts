According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `a` must have at least `n` elements. So for the loop to be executed, `a` must have at least 1 element and `num` is the first element in the list `a`.

State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, case is the second test case in the list, results is a list containing the beautiful_count of the first test case, n is the first parameter of the second test case, x is the second parameter of the second test case, y is the third parameter of the second test case, a is the array of the second test case that must have at least 1 element, freq is an empty dictionary, beautiful_count is 0, "Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a]" is printed, num is the first element in the list a**
