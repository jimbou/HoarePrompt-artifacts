Postcondition: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, case is the second test case in the list, results is a list containing the beautiful_count of the first test case, n is the first parameter of the second test case, x is the second parameter of the second test case, y is the third parameter of the second test case, a is the array of the second test case that must have at least 1 element, "Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a]" is printed, num is the first element in the list a, and this is printed: "Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y]". If (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, then freq is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) and beautiful_count is equal to the previous value of beautiful_count plus the value of freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]. If (mod_x, mod_y) is not in freq, then the current value of (mod_x, mod_y) is in freq with a value of 0, and freq is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) and beautiful_count is equal to the previous value of beautiful_count plus the value of freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y].**
