Postcondition: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, case is the third test case in the list, results is a list containing the updated beautiful_count of the first, second and third test cases, n is the first parameter of the third test case, x is the second parameter of the third test case, y is the third parameter of the third test case, a is the array of the third test case that is not empty, num is the first element in the array, freq is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple (required_mod_x, required_mod_y), beautiful_count is 0, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, and required_mod_y is equal to mod_y, and this is printed: "Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y]". The current value of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq.**
