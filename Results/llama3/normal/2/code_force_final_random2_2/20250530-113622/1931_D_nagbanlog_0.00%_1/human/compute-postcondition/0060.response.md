Postcondition: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, case is the second test case in the list, results is a list containing the updated beautiful_count of the first test case, n is the first parameter of the second test case, x is the second parameter of the second test case, y is the third parameter of the second test case, a is the array of the second test case that must have at least 2 elements, num is the second element in the list a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of (x - mod_x) divided by x, required_mod_y is mod_y, freq is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple (mod_x, mod_y) and the value is the previous value of freq[mod_x, mod_y] plus 1 if (mod_x, mod_y) is in freq, otherwise the value is 0, and beautiful_count is equal to the previous value of beautiful_count plus the value of freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y] if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq. Otherwise, the values of beautiful_count and freq remain unchanged.**
