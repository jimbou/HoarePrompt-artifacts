Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `case` is the third test case in the list, `results` is a list containing the updated beautiful_count of the first, second and third test cases, `n` is the first parameter of the third test case, `x` is the second parameter of the third test case, `y` is the third parameter of the third test case, `a` is the array of the third test case that is not empty, `num` is the first element in the array, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, and `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is a key in `freq`, then `freq` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` and `beautiful_count` is `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. Otherwise, `freq` is an empty dictionary and `beautiful_count` is 0.**
