The code prints a formatted string indicating the beautiful pairs count. The beautiful pairs count is the value of `beautiful_count` which is either the sum of the frequency of the required modulo x and y plus the frequency of the required modulo x and y if the required modulo x and y is a key in the `freq` dictionary, or 1 plus the frequency of the required modulo x and y if the required modulo x and y is not a key in the `freq` dictionary.

Output: **Beautiful pairs count: [beautiful_count] (where beautiful_count is the value of beautiful_count which is either freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y] + freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y] or 1 + freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y])**
