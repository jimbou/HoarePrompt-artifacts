The code prints a formatted string indicating that it is processing a test case. The string includes the values of the parameters of the first test case, which are n, x, y, and the array a.

The value of n is the first parameter of the first test case in the test_cases list. The value of x is the second parameter of the first test case in the test_cases list. The value of y is the third parameter of the first test case in the test_cases list. The value of a is the array of the first test case in the test_cases list.

Output: **Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a] (where n is the first parameter of the first test case, x is the second parameter of the first test case, y is the third parameter of the first test case, and a is the array of the first test case)**
