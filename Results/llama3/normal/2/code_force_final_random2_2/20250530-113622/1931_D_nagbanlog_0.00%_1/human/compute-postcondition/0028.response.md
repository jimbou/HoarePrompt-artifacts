Output: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, case is the first test case in the list, results is an empty list, n is the first parameter of the first test case, x is the second parameter of the first test case, y is the third parameter of the first test case, a is the array of the first test case that must have at least 3 elements, num is the third element in a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is equal to mod_y, freq[mod_x, mod_y] is increased by 1, and if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, then beautiful_count is increased by the value of freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y], and this is printed: "Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y]"**
