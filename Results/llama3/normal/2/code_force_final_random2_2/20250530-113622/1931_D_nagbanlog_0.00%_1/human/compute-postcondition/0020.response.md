Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first parameter of the first test case, `x` is the second parameter of the first test case, `y` is the third parameter of the first test case, `a` is the array of the first test case that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is increased by 1, and `beautiful_count` is increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `beautiful_count` has been increased by the frequency of the required modulo values, which are calculated based on the current `num`, `x`, and `y` values. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
