The code prints a formatted string containing information about the third element `num` in the array `a` of the third test case `case` in the list `test_cases`. The string includes the value of `num`, the remainder of `num` divided by `x` (denoted as `mod_x`), the remainder of `num` divided by `y` (denoted as `mod_y`), the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x` (denoted as `required_mod_x`), and the value of `required_mod_y` which is equal to `mod_y`.

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [mod_y] (where num is the third element in the array a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, and required_mod_y is equal to mod_y)**
