Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is an empty list, `case` is not defined, `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` of all test cases, `n` is not defined, `x` is not defined, `y` is not defined, `a` is not defined, `num` is not defined, `mod_x` is not defined, `mod_y` is not defined, `required_mod_x` is not defined, `required_mod_y` is not defined, `freq` is not defined, and `beautiful_count` is not defined.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list of test cases is empty, and the results list contains the beautiful counts of all test cases. The variables related to the current test case, such as `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`, `freq`, and `beautiful_count`, are no longer defined because the loop has finished executing. The value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer.
