Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list of three elements: `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by a list of `n` integers, `results` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The code only introduced a new variable `results` and initialized it as an empty list.
