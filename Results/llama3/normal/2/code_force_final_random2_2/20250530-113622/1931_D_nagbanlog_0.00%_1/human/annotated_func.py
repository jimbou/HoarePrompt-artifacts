#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list of three elements: n, x, and y, followed by a list of n integers. n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, x and y are integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and the list of n integers are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    #The program returns a list containing the `beautiful_count` of all test cases, where `beautiful_count` is not defined.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains a list of integers and two additional integers x and y. It processes each test case by iterating over the list of integers, calculating the required modulus values for x and y, and counting the number of "beautiful pairs" that satisfy certain conditions. The function returns a list containing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.
