This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains a list of integers and two additional integers x and y. It processes each test case by iterating over the list of integers, calculating the required modulus values for x and y, and counting the number of "beautiful pairs" that satisfy certain conditions. The function returns a list containing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.
