The code prints a formatted string indicating the current test case being processed. The string includes the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `a` for the second test case in the `test_cases` list.

`n` is the first parameter of the second test case, `x` is the second parameter, `y` is the third parameter, and `a` is the array of the second test case.

Output: **Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a] (where n is the first parameter of the second test case, x is the second parameter, y is the third parameter, and a is the array of the second test case)**
