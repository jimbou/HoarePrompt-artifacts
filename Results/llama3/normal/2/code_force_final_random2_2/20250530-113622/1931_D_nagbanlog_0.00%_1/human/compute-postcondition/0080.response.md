Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, case is the third test case in the list, results is a list containing the updated beautiful_count of the first, second and third test cases, n is the first parameter of the third test case, x is the second parameter of the third test case, y is the third parameter of the third test case, a is the array of the third test case that is not empty, num is the first element in the array, freq is an empty dictionary, beautiful_count is 0, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, and required_mod_y is equal to mod_y.**

The code snippet calculates the remainders of the first element in the array (`num`) when divided by `x` and `y`, and assigns these values to `mod_x` and `mod_y`, respectively. It then calculates the required remainder for `x` by subtracting `mod_x` from `x` and taking the remainder of the result when divided by `x`, and assigns this value to `required_mod_x`. The value of `required_mod_y` is simply set to `mod_y`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
