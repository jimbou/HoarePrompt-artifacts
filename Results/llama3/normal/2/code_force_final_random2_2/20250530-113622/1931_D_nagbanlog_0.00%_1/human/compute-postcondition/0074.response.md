Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `case` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing the updated beautiful_count of the first and second test cases, `n` is the first parameter of the second test case, `x` is the second parameter of the second test case, `y` is the third parameter of the second test case, `a` is an empty list, `num` is not defined, `freq` is a dictionary containing key-value pairs where the key is a tuple (mod_x, mod_y) and the value is the frequency of the tuple in the list `a`, and `beautiful_count` is the total count of beautiful pairs in the list `a`, and this is printed: "Beautiful pairs count: [beautiful_count]"**

In natural language, the output state is: The code appends the beautiful_count of the second test case to the results list. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The results list now contains the beautiful_count of the first and second test cases. The other variables retain their initial values.
