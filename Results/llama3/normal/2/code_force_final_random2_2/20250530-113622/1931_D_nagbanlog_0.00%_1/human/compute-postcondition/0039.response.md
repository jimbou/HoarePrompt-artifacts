Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, case is the second test case in the list, results is a list containing the beautiful_count of the first test case, n is the first parameter of the second test case, x is the second parameter of the second test case, y is the third parameter of the second test case, a is the array of the second test case that must have at least n elements, freq is an empty dictionary, beautiful_count is 0**.

The code snippet modifies the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `freq`, and `beautiful_count`. The new values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from the second test case in the list `test_cases`. The value of `a` is set to the array of the second test case. The dictionary `freq` is reset to an empty dictionary, and the variable `beautiful_count` is reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
