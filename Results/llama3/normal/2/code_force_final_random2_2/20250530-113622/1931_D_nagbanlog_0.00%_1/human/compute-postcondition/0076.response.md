Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, case is the third test case in the list, results is a list containing the updated beautiful_count of the first, second and third test cases, n is the first parameter of the third test case, x is the second parameter of the third test case, y is the third parameter of the third test case, a is the array of the third test case, num is not defined, freq is an empty dictionary, and beautiful_count is 0.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The code executes and updates the variables as follows: `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values of the first, second, and third parameters of the third test case, respectively. The list `a` is updated to be the array of the third test case. The dictionary `freq` is reset to be empty, and the variable `beautiful_count` is set to 0. All other variables, including `t`, `test_cases`, `case`, and `results`, remain unchanged. The printed message "Beautiful pairs count: [beautiful_count]" is not included in the output state as it is not a variable.
