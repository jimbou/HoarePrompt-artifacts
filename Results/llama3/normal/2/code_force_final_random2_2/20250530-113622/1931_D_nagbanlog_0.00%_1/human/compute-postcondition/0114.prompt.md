You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list of three elements: n, x, and y, followed by a list of n integers. n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, x and y are integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and the list of n integers are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, x, y = case['params']
        
        a = case['array']
        
        freq = {}
        
        beautiful_count = 0
        
        print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
        
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y

            required_mod_y = mod_y
            print(
                f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
                )
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
            if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
                freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
        
        print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
        
        results.append(beautiful_count)
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is an empty list, `case` is not defined, `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` of all test cases, `n` is not defined, `x` is not defined, `y` is not defined, `a` is not defined, `num` is not defined, `mod_x` is not defined, `mod_y` is not defined, `required_mod_x` is not defined, `required_mod_y` is not defined, `freq` is not defined, and `beautiful_count` is not defined.
    return results
    #The program returns a list containing the `beautiful_count` of all test cases, where `beautiful_count` is not defined.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is an empty list, `case` is not defined, `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` of all test cases, `n` is not defined, `x` is not defined, `y` is not defined, `a` is not defined, `num` is not defined, `mod_x` is not defined, `mod_y` is not defined, `required_mod_x` is not defined, `required_mod_y` is not defined, `freq` is not defined, and `beautiful_count` is not defined.

Case_2: The program returns a list containing the `beautiful_count` of all test cases, where `beautiful_count` is not defined.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
