The code prints a formatted string containing the values of the variables `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y`.

Here's a breakdown of each variable:

*   `num`: The second element in the array `a` of the third test case.
*   `mod_x`: The remainder of `num` divided by `x`, where `x` is the second parameter of the third test case.
*   `mod_y`: The remainder of `num` divided by `y`, where `y` is the third parameter of the third test case.
*   `required_mod_x`: The remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`.
*   `required_mod_y`: Equal to `mod_y`.

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [mod_y] (where num is the second element in the array a of the third test case, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, and required_mod_y is equal to mod_y)**
