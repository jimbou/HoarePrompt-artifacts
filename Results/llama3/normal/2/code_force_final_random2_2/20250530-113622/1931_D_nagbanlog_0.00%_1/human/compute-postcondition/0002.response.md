Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, case is the first test case in the list, results is an empty list, n is the first parameter of the first test case, x is the second parameter of the first test case, y is the third parameter of the first test case, a is the array of the first test case, freq is an empty dictionary, beautiful_count is 0**

The code block assigns the values of the first test case's parameters to `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the array of the first test case to `a`. It also initializes an empty dictionary `freq` and sets `beautiful_count` to 0. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, and `results` remain unchanged.
