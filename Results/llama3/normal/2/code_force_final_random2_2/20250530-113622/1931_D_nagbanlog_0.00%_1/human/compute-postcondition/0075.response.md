The only variable in the loop head is variable  case and list test_cases, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the test_cases.  If the list has at least 3 test cases the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, test_cases has at least 2 test cases, case is the second test case in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 test cases and the case is the third test case in the list.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `case` is the third test case in the list, `results` is a list containing the updated beautiful_count of the first, second and third test cases, `n` is the first parameter of the third test case, `x` is the second parameter of the third test case, `y` is the third parameter of the third test case, `a` is an empty list, `num` is not defined, `freq` is a dictionary containing key-value pairs where the key is a tuple (mod_x, mod_y) and the value is the frequency of the tuple in the list `a`, and `beautiful_count` is the total count of beautiful pairs in the list `a`, and this is printed: "Beautiful pairs count: [beautiful_count]"**
