The code prints a formatted string indicating the total count of beautiful pairs in the list `a`. Since `a` is an empty list, the frequency of any tuple (mod_x, mod_y) in the dictionary `freq` is 0, and the total count of beautiful pairs in the list `a` is also 0.

Output: **Beautiful pairs count: 0**
