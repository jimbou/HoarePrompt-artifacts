The only variable in the loop head is variable  num and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If a is not empty the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, the state before the loop starts must be adjusted to `a` is not empty and num is the first element in the array.
State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, case is the third test case in the list, results is a list containing the updated beautiful_count of the first, second and third test cases, n is the first parameter of the third test case, x is the second parameter of the third test case, y is the third parameter of the third test case, a is the array of the third test case that is not empty, num is the first element in the array, freq is an empty dictionary, and beautiful_count is 0., and this is printed: "Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a]"**
