Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first parameter of the first test case, `x` is the second parameter of the first test case, `y` is the third parameter of the first test case, `a` is the array of the first test case that must have at least 1 element, `freq` is a dictionary with a new key-value pair `(mod_x, mod_y): 0`, `beautiful_count` is not changed, `num` is the first element in `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The code adds a new key-value pair to the `freq` dictionary, where the key is the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` and the value is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The `freq` dictionary now contains a new entry for the current values of `mod_x` and `mod_y`, which were not previously present in the dictionary.
