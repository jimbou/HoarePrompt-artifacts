t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list of three elements: n, x, and y, followed by a list of n integers. n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, x and y are integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and the list of n integers are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
