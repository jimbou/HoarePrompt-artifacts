The code prints a formatted string containing information about the first element in the list `a` of the second test case. The string includes the value of the first element `num`, the remainder of `num` divided by `x` (`mod_x`), the remainder of `num` divided by `y` (`mod_y`), the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x` (`required_mod_x`), and the value of `mod_y` which is equal to `required_mod_y`.

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [mod_y] (where num is the first element in the list a, mod_x is the remainder of the first element in the list a divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of the first element in the list a divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, and required_mod_y is equal to mod_y)**
