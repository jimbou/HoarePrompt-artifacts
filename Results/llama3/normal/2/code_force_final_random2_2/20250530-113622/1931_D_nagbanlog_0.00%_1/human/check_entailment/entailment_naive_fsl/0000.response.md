Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. It uses a frequency dictionary to store the count of numbers with specific modulo values for x and y. For each number, it calculates the required modulo values for x and y to form a beautiful pair and checks if such a pair exists in the frequency dictionary. If it does, it increments the beautiful pair count. The program also handles the case where the same number can form multiple beautiful pairs.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. It does not have any obvious errors or edge cases that would cause it to produce incorrect results. Therefore, the program is correct.
