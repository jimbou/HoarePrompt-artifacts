Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first parameter of the first test case, `x` is the second parameter of the first test case, `y` is the third parameter of the first test case, `a` is the array of the first test case that must have at least 1 element, `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple of `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)`, `beautiful_count` is increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `num` is the first element in `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and the current value of `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is a key in the `freq` dictionary.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `beautiful_count` has been increased by the frequency of the required modulo values `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary. All other variables remain unchanged.
