The code prints a formatted string indicating the count of beautiful pairs in the first test case. The beautiful pairs are determined by the frequency of pairs of remainders (mod_x and mod_y) when the elements of the array 'a' are divided by 'x' and 'y' respectively. The required_mod_x and required_mod_y are calculated based on the given conditions, and the beautiful_count is the sum of the counts of all pairs in freq that have a required_mod_x and required_mod_y that are also in freq.

Output: **Beautiful pairs count: [beautiful_count] (where beautiful_count is the sum of the counts of all pairs in freq that have a required_mod_x and required_mod_y that are also in freq)**
