Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, case is the second test case in the list, results is a list containing the beautiful_count of the first test case, n is the first parameter of the second test case, x is the second parameter of the second test case, y is the third parameter of the second test case, a is the array of the second test case that must have at least 1 element, num is the first element in the list a, freq is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple (mod_x, mod_y) and the value is the previous value of freq[mod_x, mod_y] plus 1, and beautiful_count is equal to the previous value of beautiful_count plus the value of freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y].**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of the key (mod_x, mod_y) in the dictionary freq has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
