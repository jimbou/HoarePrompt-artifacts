Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters: `t` (the number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of test cases).

2. For each test case, the program extracts the parameters `n` (the size of the array), `x`, and `y` (Polycarp's favorite integers), and the array `a`.

3. It initializes an empty dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of each pair of modulo values (mod_x, mod_y) and a variable `beautiful_count` to store the count of beautiful pairs.

4. The program then iterates over each number in the array `a`. For each number, it calculates the modulo values `mod_x` and `mod_y` with respect to `x` and `y`, respectively.

5. It then calculates the required modulo values `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` that would make a pair with the current number beautiful. The required modulo values are calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x` and `mod_y`, respectively.

6. If the required modulo values are already present in the `freq` dictionary, it increments the `beautiful_count` by the frequency of the required modulo values. This is because each occurrence of the required modulo values can form a beautiful pair with the current number.

7. The program then updates the frequency of the current modulo values in the `freq` dictionary.

8. After processing all numbers in the array, the program appends the `beautiful_count` to the `results` list.

9. Finally, the program returns the `results` list containing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

Based on the provided problem description and the program's logic, it appears that the program correctly implements the required logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array.

Correctness: **True**
