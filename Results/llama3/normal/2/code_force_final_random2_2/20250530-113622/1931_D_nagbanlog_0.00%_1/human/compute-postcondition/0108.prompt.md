Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, case is the third test case in the list, results is a list containing the updated beautiful_count of the first, second and third test cases, n is the first parameter of the third test case, x is the second parameter of the third test case, y is the third parameter of the third test case, a is the array of the third test case, num is not defined, freq is an empty dictionary, and beautiful_count is 0., and this is printed: "Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a]"
Code of the loop:
for num in a:
    mod_x = num % x
    mod_y = num % y
    required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
    required_mod_y = mod_y
    print(
        f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
        )
    if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
        beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
    if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
        freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
    freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `case` is the third test case in the list, `results` is a list containing the updated beautiful_count of the first, second and third test cases, `n` is the first parameter of the third test case, `x` is the second parameter of the third test case, `y` is the third parameter of the third test case, `a` is the array of the third test case that is not empty, `num` is the first element in the array, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, and `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is a key in `freq`, then `freq` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` and `beautiful_count` is `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. Otherwise, `freq` is a dictionary with a key `(mod_x, mod_y)` and value 1, and `beautiful_count` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `case` is the third test case in the list, `results` is a list containing the updated beautiful_count of the first, second and third test cases, `n` is the first parameter of the third test case, `x` is the second parameter of the third test case, `y` is the third parameter of the third test case, `a` is the array of the third test case that must have at least two elements, `num` is the second element in the array, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, and `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`. If `(mod_x, mod_y)` is a key in `freq`, then `freq` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` and `beautiful_count` is `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` plus `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. Otherwise, `freq` is a dictionary with a key `(mod_x, mod_y)` and value 1, and `beautiful_count` is 1 plus `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. The value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` has been incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `case` is the third test case in the list, `results` is a list containing the updated beautiful_count of the first, second and third test cases, `n` is the first parameter of the third test case, `x` is the second parameter of the third test case, `y` is the third parameter of the third test case, `a` is the array of the third test case that must have at least three elements, `num` is the third element in the array, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, and `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is a key in `freq`, then `freq` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` and `beautiful_count` is `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` plus `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. Otherwise, `freq` is a dictionary with a key `(mod_x, mod_y)` and value 1, and `beautiful_count` is 1 plus `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. The value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is now 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
