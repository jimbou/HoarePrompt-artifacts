Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` of the first test case, `n` is the first parameter of the first test case, `x` is the second parameter of the first test case, `y` is the third parameter of the first test case, `a` is the array of the first test case that must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the nth element in `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, `freq` is a dictionary where the keys are pairs of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all elements in `a` and the values are the counts of each pair, and `beautiful_count` is the sum of the counts of all pairs in `freq` that have a `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` that are also in `freq`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The code appends the `beautiful_count` of the first test case to the `results` list. The `beautiful_count` is the sum of the counts of all pairs in the frequency dictionary that have a required remainder when divided by `x` and `y` that are also present in the frequency dictionary. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
