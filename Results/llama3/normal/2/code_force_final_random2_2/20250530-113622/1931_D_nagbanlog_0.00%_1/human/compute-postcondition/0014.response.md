Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first parameter of the first test case, `x` is the second parameter of the first test case, `y` is the third parameter of the first test case, `a` is the array of the first test case that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first element in `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`. If `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not a key in the `freq` dictionary, then `freq` is updated with a new key-value pair `(mod_x, mod_y): 0` and `beautiful_count` is not changed. Otherwise, `beautiful_count` is increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is a key in the `freq` dictionary.***
