State: **`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an integer equal to 2 * k, `i` is 3, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing two or four instances of the largest integer in b, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is either an empty list or a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, and if the first two elements of b are not equal, l also contains the last element of b and possibly the current value of `b[i]`. If the first two elements of b are equal, `l` does not contain the current value of `b[i]`. If k is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, `ans1` is a list containing four instances of the largest integer in b and `k` is reduced by 2. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, no changes are made.**
