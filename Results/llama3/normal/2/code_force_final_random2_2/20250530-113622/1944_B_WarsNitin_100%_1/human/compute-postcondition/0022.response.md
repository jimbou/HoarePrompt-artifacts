State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` is a list containing two times the value of `b[i]` if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is an integer equal to 0, `i` is 2, `l` is either a list containing the first element of `b`, the last element of `b` and `b[i]` if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, otherwise `l` is either a list containing the first element of `b` and the last element of `b` or an empty list depending on the second last element of `b`, and `k` is reduced by 2 if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`.
