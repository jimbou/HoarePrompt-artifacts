Output State: `t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is either 0 or not 0, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` is a list containing two times the value of `b[i]` for all `i` where `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, `ans2` is either an empty list or a list containing two times the value of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `req` is an integer equal to 0, `i` is `n`, and `l` is either a list containing the first element of `b`, the last element of `b` and `b[i]` for all `i` where `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]` or an empty list depending on the second last element of `b`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times, with the only difference being that `i` is now equal to `n`. This is because the loop will continue to execute until `i` is no longer less than `n`, at which point it will exit the loop. The values of `k`, `ans2`, and `l` will depend on the values of `c[i]` and `b[i]` during the execution of the loop.
