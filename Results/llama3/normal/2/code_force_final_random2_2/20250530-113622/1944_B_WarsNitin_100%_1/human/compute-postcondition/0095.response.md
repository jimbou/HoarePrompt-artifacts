Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an integer equal to 2 * k, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * k, `ans1` is either a list containing two instances of the current value of `b[i]` or an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, and if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, then `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but the program flow is affected by the break statement.
