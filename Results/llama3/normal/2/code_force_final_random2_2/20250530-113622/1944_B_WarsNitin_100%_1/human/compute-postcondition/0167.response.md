Output State: **t is greater than 1, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an integer equal to 2 * k, i is 2, ans1 is a list containing four instances of the largest integer in b, ans2 is an empty list, l is either an empty list or a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, and if the first two elements of b are not equal, l also contains the last element of b and possibly the current value of b[i]. If the first two elements of b are equal, l does not contain the current value of b[i]. k is reduced by 2.**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables as follows: The first line appends the value of `b[i]` to `ans1`, which is the largest integer in `b`. The second line appends the value of `b[i]` to `ans1` again, resulting in `ans1` containing four instances of the largest integer in `b`. The third line decrements `k` by 2. No other variables are affected by the code snippet.
