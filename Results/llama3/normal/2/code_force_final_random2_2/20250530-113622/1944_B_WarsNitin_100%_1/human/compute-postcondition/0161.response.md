Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an integer equal to 2 * k, `i` is 1, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing two instances of the largest integer in b, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and the current value of `b[i]`. The first two elements of b are not equal. The current value of `b[i]` is not equal to the current value of `b[i + 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to include the current value of `b[i]`, which is the second element of the sorted list `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. The first two elements of `b` are still not equal, and the current value of `b[i]` is still not equal to the current value of `b[i + 1]`.
