Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `q` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged, `c` is unchanged, `req` is unchanged, `ans1` is unchanged, `l` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `i` is increased by 1, `ans2` is unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables remain unchanged, and the value of `i` is increased by 1. Additionally, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
