Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` is a list containing two times the value of `b[i]` for all `i` where `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, `ans2` is either an empty list or a list containing two times the value of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `req` is an integer equal to 0, `i` is 0, and `l` is either a list containing the first element of `b`, the last element of `b` and `b[i]` for all `i` where `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]` or an empty list depending on the second last element of `b` that must have at least 1 element. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
