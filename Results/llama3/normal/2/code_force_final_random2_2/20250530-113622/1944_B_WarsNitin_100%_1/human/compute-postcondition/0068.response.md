Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` is a list containing two times the value of `b[i]` for all `i` where `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]` and `l[i]`, `ans2` is either an empty list or a list containing two times the value of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]` and `l[i]`, `req` is an integer equal to 0, `i` is 2, `l` is either a list containing the first element of `b`, the last element of `b` and `b[i]` for all `i` where `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]` or an empty list depending on the second last element of `b` that must have at least 2 elements, and `k` is either -1 or a value greater than -1. If `k` is -1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code simply breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, without changing the values of any variables. Therefore, all variables retain their initial values, and the program exits the current loop or if statement.
