Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an integer equal to 2 * k, `i` is 3, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing two or four instances of the largest integer in b, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is either an empty list or a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, and if the first two elements of b are not equal, l also contains the last element of b and possibly the current value of `b[i]`. If the first two elements of b are equal, `l` does not contain the current value of `b[i]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all variables retain their previous values, and the only change is that we exit the loop or if statement.
