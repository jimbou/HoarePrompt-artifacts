The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is unknown, `n` is unknown. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **`t` is unchanged, `q` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged, `c` is unchanged, `req` is unchanged, `ans1` is unchanged, `l` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `i` is increased by 1, `ans2` is unchanged**
