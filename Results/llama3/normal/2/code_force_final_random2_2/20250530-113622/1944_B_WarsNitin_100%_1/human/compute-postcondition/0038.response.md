Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to 0, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` is a list containing two times the value of `b[i]` for all `i` where `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is an integer equal to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and `l` is either a list containing the first element of `b`, the last element of `b` and `b[i]` for all `i` where `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]` or an empty list depending on the second last element of `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `k` is now equal to `req`, which is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
