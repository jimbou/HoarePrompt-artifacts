Output State: **t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is either -2 or not 0, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing two times the value of b[i] for all i where b[i] is equal to b[i - 1], ans2 is a list containing two times the value of c[i] if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1] and two times the value of c[i] for the current value of i, req is an integer equal to 0, i is 2, and l is either a list containing the first element of b, the last element of b and b[i] for all i where b[i] is not equal to b[i + 1] or an empty list depending on the second last element of b.**

The code block modifies the value of `k` by subtracting 2 from it, and appends two times the value of `c[i]` to `ans2`. The value of `i` is used to access the element of `c` to be appended to `ans2`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
