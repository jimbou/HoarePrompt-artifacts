Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an integer equal to 2 * k, `i` is 3, `k` is an integer equal to req - 2. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is either a list containing 2 * (n - 2) instances of the current value of `b[i]` or an empty list, `ans2` is a list containing 4 instances of the current value of `c[i]`, and `l` is a list containing two instances of the value of `b[i]`. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i - 1]`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on the variables are still valid.
