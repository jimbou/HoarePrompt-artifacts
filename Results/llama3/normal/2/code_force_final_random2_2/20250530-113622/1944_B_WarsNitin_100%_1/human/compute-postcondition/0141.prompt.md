Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an integer equal to 2 * k, i is n - 1, k is 0, ans1 is either a list containing 2 * (n - 2) instances of the current value of b[i] or an empty list, ans2 is a list containing 2 * (n - 1) instances of the current value of c[i], and l is a list containing two instances of the value of b[i].
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    if k == 0:
        break
    ans1.append(l[i])
    ans2.append(l[i])
    k -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an integer equal to 2 * k, i is n - 1, k is -1, ans1 is either a list containing 2 * (n - 2) instances of the current value of b[i] plus one instance of the value of b[i], or an empty list plus one instance of the value of b[i], ans2 is a list containing 2 * (n - 1) instances of the current value of c[i] plus one instance of the value of b[i], and l is a list containing at least 1 instance of the value of b[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 0, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an integer equal to 2 * k, i is n, k is -2, ans1 is either a list containing 2 * (n - 2) instances of the current value of b[i] plus two instances of the value of l[i], or an empty list plus two instances of the value of l[i], ans2 is a list containing 2 * (n - 1) instances of the current value of c[i] plus two instances of the value of l[i], and l is a list containing at least 2 instances of the value of b[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 0, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an integer equal to 2 * k, i is n + 1, k is -3, ans1 is either a list containing 2 * (n - 2) instances of the current value of b[i] plus three instances of the value of l[i], or an empty list plus three instances of the value of l[i], ans2 is a list containing 2 * (n - 1) instances of the current value of c[i] plus three instances of the value of l[i], and l is a list containing at least 3 instances of the value of b[i].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
