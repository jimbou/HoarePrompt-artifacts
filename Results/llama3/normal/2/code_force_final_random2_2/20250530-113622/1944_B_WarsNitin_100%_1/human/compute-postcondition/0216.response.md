Output State: **t is 0, q is t, stdin contains no test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing two times the value of b[i] for all i where b[i] is equal to b[i - 1] and l[i], ans2 is either an empty list or a list containing two times the value of c[i] if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1] and l[i], req is an integer equal to 0, i is n, l is either a list containing the first element of b, the last element of b and b[i] for all i where b[i] is not equal to b[i + 1] or an empty list depending on the second last element of b that must have at least n elements, and k is either -n or a value greater than -n, and the list ans1 is printed, and the list ans2 is printed**

This output state means that the loop has executed all the iterations, and the loop head and body variables have reached their final values. The loop has processed all the test cases in the input, and the output lists ans1 and ans2 have been printed for each test case. The variables n, a, b, c, req, i, l, and k have reached their final values, which are determined by the last iteration of the loop. The variable t is now 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
