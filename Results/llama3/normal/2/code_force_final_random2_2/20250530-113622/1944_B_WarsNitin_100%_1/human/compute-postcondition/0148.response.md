Output State: **t is greater than 1, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an integer equal to 2 * k, i is n + 1, k is -4, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, and l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive.**

In this output state, the value of variable l has been changed by the code. The list l now contains the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, which is the first element of the sorted list b. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
