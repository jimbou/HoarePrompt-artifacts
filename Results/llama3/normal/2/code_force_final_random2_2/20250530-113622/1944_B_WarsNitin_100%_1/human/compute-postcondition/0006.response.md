Postcondition: **t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and floor(n/2) inclusive multiplied by 2, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, req is an integer equal to k. The current value of b[n - 2] is not equal to b[n - 1]. If the first two elements of b are not equal, l is a list containing the first element of b. Otherwise, l remains an empty list.**
