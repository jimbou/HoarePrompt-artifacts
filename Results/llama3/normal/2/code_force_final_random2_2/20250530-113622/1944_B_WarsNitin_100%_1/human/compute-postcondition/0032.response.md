Postcondition: ***`k`, `t`, `q`, `stdin`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `req`, `i`, and `l` are as described in the precondition. If `k` is equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `k`, `t`, `q`, `stdin`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `req`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged.***
