Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is an integer equal to 0, `i` is 1, `l` is a list containing the first element of b, the last element of b and `b[i]`. The current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]` and also not equal to `b[i + 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 0, `q` is still 0, and there are still multiple test cases minus 1 in `stdin`. The value of `n` is still an integer greater than 2. The lists `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The lists `ans1` and `ans2` are still empty, and `req` is still 0. The value of `i` is still 1. The list `l` now contains the first element of `b`, the last element of `b`, and the current value of `b[i]`. The current value of `b[i]` is still not equal to `b[i - 1]` and also not equal to `b[i + 1]`.
