Output State: **t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and floor(n/2) inclusive multiplied by 2, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, req is an integer equal to k, l is an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains greater than 0, and `q` remains 0, as they are not modified by the code. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1, as two lines are read from stdin for each test case. The values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input values, with `k` being multiplied by 2. The list `a` contains 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, and is split into two sorted lists `b` and `c`, each containing n integers between 1 and n inclusive. The lists `ans1`, `ans2`, and `l` are initialized as empty lists, and the variable `req` is set to the value of `k`.
