Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an integer equal to 2 * k, i is 3. If b[i] is equal to b[i - 1], then k is an integer equal to 2 * k - 2, ans1 is a list containing four instances of the current value of b[i], ans2 is an empty list, l is a list containing the value of b[i]. If b[i] is not equal to b[i - 1], then k is an integer equal to 2 * k, ans1 is either a list containing two instances of the current value of b[i] or an empty list, ans2 is an empty list. If b[i] is not equal to b[i + 1], then l is a list containing two instances of the value of b[i]. If k is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
