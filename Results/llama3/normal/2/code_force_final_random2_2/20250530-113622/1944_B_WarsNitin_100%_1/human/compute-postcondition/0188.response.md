Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and must be at least 3, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an integer equal to 2 * k, `i` is 2, `ans1` is a list containing two or four instances of the largest integer in b, `ans2` is a list containing two instances of the current value of c[i] if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], otherwise ans2 is an empty list, `l` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, and if the first two elements of b are not equal, l also contains the last element of b and possibly some other elements from b, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * k minus 2 if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], otherwise k remains the same, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the values of all variables remain unchanged, but the program flow is affected by the break statement.
