Output State: **`k` is not equal to 0, `t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` contains four times the value of `b[i]` if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]` and `b[i]` is equal to `b[i + 1]`, otherwise `ans1` contains two times the value of `b[i]` if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is an integer equal to 0, `i` is 3, and `l` is either a list containing the first element of `b`, the last element of `b`, `b[i]` and `b[i]` if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, otherwise `l` is either a list containing the first element of `b`, the last element of `b` and `b[i]` or a list containing the first element of `b`, the last element of `b` and two times the value of `b[i]` if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, otherwise `l` is either a list containing the first element of `b` and the last element of `b` or an empty list depending on the second last element of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but we exit the loop or if statement we were directly inside.
