Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input:

n = 4, k = 1
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4]

The program will output:

1 2
1 2

However, the correct output should be:

1 2
3 4

or

3 4
1 2

The program fails to consider the case where the first and last elements of the first half of the array are not equal, and the same for the second half. In this case, the program should output the first and last elements of each half, not the first two elements of each half.

The program also fails to consider the case where k is greater than 1. In this case, the program should output 2k elements, not just 2 elements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
