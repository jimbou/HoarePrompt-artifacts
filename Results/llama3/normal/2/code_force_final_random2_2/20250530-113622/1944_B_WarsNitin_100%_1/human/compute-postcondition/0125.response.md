Output State: **t is greater than 0, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an integer equal to 2 * k, i is 3, k is an integer equal to req - 2, ans1 is either a list containing 2 * (n - 2) instances of the current value of b[i] or an empty list, ans2 is a list containing 4 instances of the current value of c[i] plus two more instances of the current value of c[i], l is a list containing two instances of the value of b[i].**

The code block modifies the state of `ans2` and `k`. The first line appends the current value of `c[i]` to `ans2`, and the second line does the same. As a result, `ans2` now contains four instances of the current value of `c[i]` plus two more instances of the current value of `c[i]`. The third line decrements `k` by 2. No other variables are affected.
