Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, req is an integer equal to 2 * k, i is n, and k is an integer equal to 2 * k. If the first two elements of b are not equal, l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive. Otherwise, l remains an empty list.***
