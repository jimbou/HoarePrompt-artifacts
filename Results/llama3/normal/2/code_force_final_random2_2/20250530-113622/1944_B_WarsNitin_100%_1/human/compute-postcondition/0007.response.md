Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and floor(n/2) inclusive multiplied by 2, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is an integer equal to k, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` and the last element of `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 0, `q` remains 0, and there are still multiple test cases minus 1 in the standard input. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans1`, `ans2`, and `req` remain the same as in the initial state. The list `l` now contains two elements: the first element of `b` and the last element of `b`, which is `b[n - 1]`.
