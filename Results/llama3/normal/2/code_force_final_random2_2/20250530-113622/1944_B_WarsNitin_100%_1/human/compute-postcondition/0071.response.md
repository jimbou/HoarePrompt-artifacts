Output State: **t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing two times the value of b[i] for all i where b[i] is equal to b[i - 1] and l[i], ans2 is either an empty list or a list containing two times the value of c[i] if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1] and l[i], req is an integer equal to 0, i is n, l is either a list containing the first element of b, the last element of b and b[i] for all i where b[i] is not equal to b[i + 1] or an empty list depending on the second last element of b that must have at least n elements, and k is either -n or a value greater than -n.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times, with the only difference being that `i` is now equal to `n`. This is because the loop will continue to execute until `i` is no longer less than `n`, at which point it will exit the loop. The values of `k`, `ans2`, and `l` will depend on the values of `c[i]` and `b[i]` during the execution of the loop.
