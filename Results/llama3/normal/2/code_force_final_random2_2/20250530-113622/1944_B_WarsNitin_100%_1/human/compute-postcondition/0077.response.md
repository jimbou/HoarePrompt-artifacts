Output State: **t is greater than 0, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, req is an integer equal to 2 * k, i is n, l is an empty list, and k is an integer equal to 2 * k.**

The code block modifies the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `req`, `i`, `l`, and `k`. The initial state of `t` and `q` remains unchanged. The value of `n` is updated to an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, and `k` is updated to an integer equal to 2 * k. The list `a` is updated to a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive. The lists `b` and `c` are updated to sorted lists of n integers between 1 and n inclusive. The lists `ans1` and `ans2` are initialized as empty lists. The value of `req` is updated to an integer equal to 2 * k. The value of `i` remains unchanged as `n`. The list `l` is initialized as an empty list. The value of `k` is updated to an integer equal to 2 * k.
