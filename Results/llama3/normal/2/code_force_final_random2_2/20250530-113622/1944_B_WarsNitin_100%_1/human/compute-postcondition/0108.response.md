Output State: **t is greater than 0, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an integer equal to 2 * k, i is n - 1, and k is an integer equal to 0. If b[i] is equal to b[i - 1], then ans1 is a list containing 2 * (n - 1) instances of the current value of b[i], ans2 is an empty list, and l is a list containing the value of b[i]. If b[i] is not equal to b[i - 1], then ans1 is either a list containing 2 * (n - 2) instances of the current value of b[i] or an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, and l is a list containing two instances of the value of b[i].**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will continue to execute until `i` reaches `n-1`. At this point, `k` will be 0, and the loop will break. The final state of the variables will depend on the values of `b[i]` and `b[i-1]`.

If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i-1]`, then `ans1` will contain 2*(n-1) instances of the current value of `b[i]`, and `l` will contain the value of `b[i]`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i-1]`, then `ans1` will contain either 2*(n-2) instances of the current value of `b[i]` or an empty list, and `l` will contain two instances of the value of `b[i]`.

The other variables, `t`, `q`, `stdin`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `req`, will remain unchanged.
