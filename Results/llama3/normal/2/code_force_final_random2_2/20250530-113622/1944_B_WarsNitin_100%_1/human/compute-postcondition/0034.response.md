Output State: **`k`, `t`, `q`, `stdin`, `n`, `a`, `c`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `req`, `i` remain unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `l` is updated by appending the value of `b[i]` to it. If `k` is equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `l` is updated by appending the value of `b[i]` to it, while all other variables remain unchanged. The condition `k` is equal to 0 still applies, and if it is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
