Postcondition: ***`t`, `q`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `req`, `ans1`, `l` are unchanged, `i` is increased by 1. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `k` is decreased by 2 and `ans2` has two additional elements which are both equal to `c[i]`. If `k` is 0 or less, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
