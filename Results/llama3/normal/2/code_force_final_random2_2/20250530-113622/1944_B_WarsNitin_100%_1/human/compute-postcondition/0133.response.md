The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list l, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list l.  If the list has at least 2 instances of the value of b[i] the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, l has at least 1 instance of the value of b[i], i is n - 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 instances of the value of b[i] and the index is n.
State: **t is greater than 0, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an integer equal to 2 * k, i is n, k is -1, ans1 is either a list containing 2 * (n - 2) instances of the current value of b[i] plus one instance of the value of b[i], or an empty list plus one instance of the value of b[i], ans2 is a list containing 2 * (n - 1) instances of the current value of c[i] plus one instance of the value of b[i], and l is a list containing at least 2 instances of the value of b[i]**
