Output State: **t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and floor(n/2) inclusive multiplied by 2, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, req is an integer equal to k, l is a list containing the first element of b which is not equal to the second element of b.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t remains greater than 0, q remains 0, and the number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1. The values of n, k, a, b, c, ans1, ans2, and req remain the same. The list l now contains the first element of b, which is not equal to the second element of b.
