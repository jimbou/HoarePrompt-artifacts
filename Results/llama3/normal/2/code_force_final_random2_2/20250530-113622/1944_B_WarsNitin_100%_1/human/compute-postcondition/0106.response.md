Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an integer equal to 2 * k, `i` is 3, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * k, `ans1` is either a list containing two instances of the current value of `b[i]` or an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, then `l` is a list containing two instances of the value of `b[i]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
