Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an integer equal to 2 * k, `i` is n - 1, `k` is 0, `ans1` is either a list containing 2 * (n - 2) instances of the current value of b[i] or an empty list, `ans2` is a list containing 2 * (n - 1) instances of the current value of c[i], and `l` is a list containing at least 1 instance of the value of b[i], and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and we exit the innermost loop or conditional statement.
