Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the elements of the list `ans2`. 

The list `ans2` is either an empty list or a list containing two times the value of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]` and `l[i]`. 

Since the exact values of `c` and `l` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in `ans2`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the elements of `ans2`.

Output: **elements of ans2 (where ans2 is either an empty list or a list containing two times the value of c[i] if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1] and l[i])**
