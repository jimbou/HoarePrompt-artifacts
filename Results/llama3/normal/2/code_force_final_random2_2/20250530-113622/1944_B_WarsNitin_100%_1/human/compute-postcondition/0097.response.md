Output State: **t is greater than 0, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an integer equal to 2 * k, i is 2, k is an integer equal to 2 * k - 2, ans1 is a list containing four instances of the current value of b[i], ans2 is an empty list, and if b[i] is not equal to b[i + 1], then l is a list containing the value of b[i].**

The code block modifies the values of `ans1`, `k`. The first line appends the current value of `b[i]` to `ans1` twice, making `ans1` a list containing four instances of the current value of `b[i]`. The second line decrements `k` by 2, making `k` an integer equal to 2 * k - 2. No other variables are affected.
