Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is an integer equal to 2 * k, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and we exit the current loop or if statement.
