Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an integer equal to 2 * k, `i` is 1, the current value of `k` is 0, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing two instances of the largest integer in b, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is either an empty list or a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, and if the first two elements of b are not equal, l also contains the last element of b, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables are not affected by the break statement, so they remain the same as in the initial state.
