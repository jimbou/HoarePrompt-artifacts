Output State: **t is greater than 0, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing two instances of the current value of b[i], ans2 is an empty list, req is an integer equal to 2 * k, i is 1, and k is an integer equal to 2 * k - 2. If k is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of b[i] is equal to the current value of b[i - 1].**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables as follows:

*   `ans1` is appended with two instances of the current value of `b[i]`, which is equal to the current value of `b[i - 1]`.
*   `k` is decremented by 2.

All other variables remain unchanged. The final state includes the updated values of `ans1` and `k`, while maintaining the initial values of all other variables.
