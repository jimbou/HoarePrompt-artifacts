This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function then processes these integers, sorting them and creating two lists, ans1 and ans2, based on certain conditions. It prints the contents of ans1 and ans2. The function repeats this process for all test cases, ultimately consuming all input from standard input.
