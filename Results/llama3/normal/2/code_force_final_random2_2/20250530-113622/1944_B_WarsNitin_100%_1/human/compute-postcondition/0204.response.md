Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an integer equal to 2 * k, `i` is 1, `ans1` is a list containing two or four instances of the largest integer in b plus one instance of l[i], `ans2` is a list containing two instances of each pair of equal adjacent elements in c plus one instance of l[i], `l` is a list containing at least 2 elements, and `k` is -1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1.
