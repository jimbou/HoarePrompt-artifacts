Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and floor(n/2) inclusive multiplied by 2, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, req is an integer equal to k. If the second last element of b is not equal to the last element of b, l is a list containing the first element of b and the last element of b. Otherwise, ans1 is a list containing two elements equal to the last element of b, req is an integer equal to k + 2, and l is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
        l.append(b[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` is a list containing two times the value of `b[i]` if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is an integer equal to 0, `i` is 1, `l` is either a list containing the first element of `b`, the last element of `b` and `b[i]` if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, otherwise `l` is either a list containing the first element of `b` and the last element of `b` or an empty list depending on the second last element of `b`, and `k` is reduced by 2 if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *The program state remains unchanged if `k` is not equal to 0. If `k` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, with `t` being greater than 0, `q` being 0, `stdin` containing multiple test cases minus 1, `n` being an integer greater than 2, `a` being a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` being a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` being a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` contains four times the value of `b[i]` if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]` and `b[i]` is equal to `b[i + 1]`, otherwise `ans1` contains two times the value of `b[i]` if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is an integer equal to 0, `i` is 2, and `l` is either a list containing the first element of `b`, the last element of `b`, `b[i]` and `b[i]` if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, otherwise `l` is either a list containing the first element of `b`, the last element of `b` and `b[i]` or a list containing the first element of `b`, the last element of `b` and two times the value of `b[i]` if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, otherwise `l` is either a list containing the first element of `b` and the last element of `b` or an empty list depending on the second last element of `b`, and `k` is reduced by 2 if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is decreased by 2 and `ans1` has two additional elements equal to `b[i]`, while `t`, `q`, `stdin`, `n`, `a`, `c`, `ans2`, `req`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `l` is updated by appending the value of `b[i]` to it, and if `k` is equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `k`, `t`, `q`, `stdin`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `req`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
