Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an integer equal to 2 * k, `i` is 3, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * k, `ans1` is either a list containing two instances of the current value of `b[i]` or an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is a list containing two instances of the value of `b[i]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 0, `q` is still 1, and the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1. The value of `n` is still an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive. The lists `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The value of `req` is still equal to 2 * k, and `i` is still 3. The value of `k` is still an integer equal to 2 * k. The list `ans1` is either a list containing two instances of the current value of `b[i]` or an empty list, and `ans2` is still an empty list. The list `l` now contains two instances of the value of `b[i]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
