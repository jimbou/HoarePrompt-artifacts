Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, 1 <= k <= floor(n/2)). The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n (1 <= a_i <= n). Every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    b = a[:n]
    c = a[n:]
    b.sort()
    c.sort()
    ans1 = []
    ans2 = []
    k = 2 * k
    req = k
    l = []
    if b[0] != b[1]:
        l.append(b[0])
    if b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]:
        l.append(b[n - 1])
    else:
        ans1.append(b[n - 1])
        ans1.append(b[n - 1])
        k -= 2
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
            ans1.append(b[i])
            ans1.append(b[i])
            k -= 2
        elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
            l.append(b[i])
    k = req
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
            ans2.append(c[i])
            ans2.append(c[i])
            k -= 2
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if k == 0:
            break
        ans1.append(l[i])
        ans2.append(l[i])
        k -= 1
    print(*ans1)
    print(*ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing two times the value of b[i] for all i where b[i] is equal to b[i - 1] and l[i], ans2 is either an empty list or a list containing two times the value of c[i] if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1] and l[i], req is an integer equal to 0, i is n, l is either a list containing the first element of b, the last element of b and b[i] for all i where b[i] is not equal to b[i + 1] or an empty list depending on the second last element of b that must have at least n elements, and k is either -n or a value greater than -n, and the list ans1 is printed, and the list ans2 is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 0, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an integer equal to 2 * k, i is n + 1, k is -2, ans1 is either a list containing 2 * (n - 2) instances of the current value of b[i] plus two instances of the value of l[i], or an empty list plus two instances of the value of l[i], ans2 is a list containing 2 * (n - 1) instances of the current value of c[i] plus two instances of the value of l[i], and l is a list containing at least 2 instances of the value of b[i], and ans1 is printed, and the following is printed: 2 * (n - 1) instances of the current value of c[i] plus two instances of the value of l[i]

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 1, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an integer equal to 2 * k, i is len(l) - 1, ans1 is a list containing two or four instances of the largest integer in b plus len(l) instances of l[i], ans2 is a list containing two instances of each pair of equal adjacent elements in c plus len(l) instances of l[i], l is a list containing at least len(l) elements, and k is -len(l), and this is printed: two instances of each pair of equal adjacent elements in c plus len(l) instances of the last element of the list l




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
