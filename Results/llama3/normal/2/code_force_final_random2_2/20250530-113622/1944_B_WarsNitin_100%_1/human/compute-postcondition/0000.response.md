Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, 1 <= k <= floor(n/2)). The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n (1 <= a_i <= n). Every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The remaining input, which contains multiple test cases, each with two lines, is still present in the stdin. The values of `n`, `k`, and `a_i` are not affected by this code snippet, so they remain as specified in the initial state.
