The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an integer equal to 2 * k, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer equal to req - 2. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is either a list containing 2 * (n - 2) instances of the current value of `b[i]` or an empty list, `ans2` is a list containing 2 instances of the current value of `c[i]`, and `l` is a list containing two instances of the value of `b[i]`.**
