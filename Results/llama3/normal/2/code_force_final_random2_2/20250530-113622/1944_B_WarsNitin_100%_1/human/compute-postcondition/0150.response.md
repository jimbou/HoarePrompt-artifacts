Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an integer equal to 2 * k, `i` is n + 1, `k` is -4, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and the last element of `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to include the last element of `b`, which is the largest integer between 1 and n inclusive. The other variables remain unchanged.
