Output State: **t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing two times the value of b[i] for all i where b[i] is equal to b[i - 1] and l[i], ans2 is either an empty list or a list containing two times the value of c[i] if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1] and l[i], req is an integer equal to 0, i is 2, l is either a list containing the first element of b, the last element of b and b[i] for all i where b[i] is not equal to b[i + 1] or an empty list depending on the second last element of b that must have at least 2 elements, and k is either -2 or a value greater than -2.**

The code appends the value of `l[i]` to both `ans1` and `ans2`, and then decrements `k` by 1. Since `i` is 2, `l[i]` refers to the third element of `l`. The value of `l[i]` is appended to both `ans1` and `ans2`, modifying their contents. The value of `k` is decremented by 1, changing its value. No other variables are affected by the code.
