Output State: **t is greater than 0, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, req is an integer equal to 2 * k, i is n, l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, and k is an integer equal to 2 * k.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t is still greater than 0, q is still 1, and there are still multiple test cases minus 1 in the standard input. The value of n is still an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive. The lists a, b, and c still contain the same number and range of integers as before. The lists ans1 and ans2 are still empty. The value of req is still equal to 2 * k, and the value of i is still n. The list l now contains the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, which is the first element of the sorted list b. The value of k is still equal to 2 * k.
