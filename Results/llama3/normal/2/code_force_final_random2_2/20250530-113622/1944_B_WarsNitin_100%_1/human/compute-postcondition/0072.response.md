The code prints the elements of the list `ans1`, which contains two times the value of `b[i]` for all `i` where `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]` and `l[i]`. Since `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, and `l` is either a list containing the first element of `b`, the last element of `b`, and `b[i]` for all `i` where `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]` or an empty list, the elements of `ans1` are two times the value of `b[i]` for all `i` where `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]` and `l[i]`.

Output: **two times the value of b[i] for all i where b[i] is equal to b[i - 1] and l[i] (where b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, and l is either a list containing the first element of b, the last element of b and b[i] for all i where b[i] is not equal to b[i + 1] or an empty list)**
