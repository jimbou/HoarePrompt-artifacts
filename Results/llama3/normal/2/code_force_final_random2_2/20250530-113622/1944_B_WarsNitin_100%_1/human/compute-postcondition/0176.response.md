Postcondition: ***The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement when k equals 0, or continues execution with the current values of t, q, n, a, b, c, req, i, ans1, ans2 remaining unchanged. If b[i] is not equal to b[i + 1], l is updated by appending the value of b[i] to it. Otherwise, the values of t, q, n, a, b, c, req, i, ans1, ans2, and l remain unchanged.***
