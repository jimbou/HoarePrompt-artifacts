Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *t is greater than 1, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an integer equal to 2 * k, i is n + 1, k is either -4 or -6, ans1 is either an empty list or a list containing two instances of the largest integer in b, ans2 is an empty list, l is either an empty list or a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, and if the first two elements of b are not equal, l also contains the last element of b.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
        l.append(b[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an integer equal to 2 * k, `i` is 1, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing two or four instances of the largest integer in b, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is either an empty list or a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, and if the first two elements of b are not equal, l also contains the last element of b and possibly the current value of `b[i]`. If the first two elements of b are equal, `l` does not contain the current value of `b[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an integer equal to 2 * k, `i` is 2, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing two or four instances of the largest integer in b, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is either an empty list or a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, and if the first two elements of b are not equal, l also contains the last element of b and possibly the current value of `b[i]`. If the first two elements of b are equal, `l` does not contain the current value of `b[i]`. If k is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, `ans1` is a list containing four instances of the largest integer in b and `k` is reduced by 2. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement when k equals 0 or -2, or continues execution with the current values of t, q, n, a, b, c, req, i, ans1, ans2, and l remaining unchanged. If b[i] equals b[i - 1], the value of b[i] is appended to ans1 twice. If b[i] is not equal to b[i - 1] and b[i] is not equal to b[i + 1], l is updated by appending the value of b[i] to it. Otherwise, the values of t, q, n, a, b, c, req, i, ans1, ans2, and l remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
