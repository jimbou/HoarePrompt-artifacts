Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 1, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an integer equal to 2 * k, i is n - 1, ans1 is a list containing two or four instances of the largest integer in b, ans2 is an empty list, l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, and if the first two elements of b are not equal, l also contains the last element of b and possibly some other elements from b, k is an integer equal to 2 * k.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is greater than 1, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and must be at least 2, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an integer equal to 2 * k, i is 1, ans1 is a list containing two or four instances of the largest integer in b, ans2 is a list containing two instances of the current value of c[i] if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], otherwise ans2 is an empty list, l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, and if the first two elements of b are not equal, l also contains the last element of b and possibly some other elements from b, k is an integer equal to 2 * k minus 2 if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], otherwise k remains the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement when k is 0 or -2, or continues execution with the current values of t, q, n, a, b, c, req, i, ans1, l, and k remaining unchanged. If c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], then ans2 has two additional elements which are both equal to c[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t`, `q`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `req`, `ans1`, `l` are unchanged, `i` is increased by 1. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `k` is decreased by 2 and `ans2` has two additional elements which are both equal to `c[i]`. If `k` is 0 or less, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
