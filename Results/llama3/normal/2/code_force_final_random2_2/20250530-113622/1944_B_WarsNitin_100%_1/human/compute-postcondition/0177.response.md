Postcondition: ***The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement when k equals 0 or -2, or continues execution with the current values of t, q, n, a, b, c, req, i, ans1, ans2, and l remaining unchanged. If b[i] equals b[i - 1], the value of b[i] is appended to ans1 twice. If b[i] is not equal to b[i - 1] and b[i] is not equal to b[i + 1], l is updated by appending the value of b[i] to it. Otherwise, the values of t, q, n, a, b, c, req, i, ans1, ans2, and l remain unchanged.***
