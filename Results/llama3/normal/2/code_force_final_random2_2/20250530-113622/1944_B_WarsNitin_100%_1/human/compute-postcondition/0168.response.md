Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an integer equal to 2 * k, `i` is 2, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing two or four instances of the largest integer in b, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is either an empty list or a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, the last element of b, and possibly the current value of `b[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `l` now contains the current value of `b[i]` in addition to its previous elements. The value of `b[i]` is appended to the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged.
