Postcondition: **If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is decreased by 2 and `ans1` has two additional elements equal to `b[i]`, while `t`, `q`, `stdin`, `n`, `a`, `c`, `ans2`, `req`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `l` is updated by appending the value of `b[i]` to it, and if `k` is equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `k`, `t`, `q`, `stdin`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `req`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged.**
