Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is an integer equal to 2 * k, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * k, `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i]`, and if k is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`. The current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables maintain their initial values and properties, except that a new list `l` is created and appended with the value of `b[i]`, which is a unique value in the sorted list `b`. The program also maintains the condition that if `k` is 0, it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
