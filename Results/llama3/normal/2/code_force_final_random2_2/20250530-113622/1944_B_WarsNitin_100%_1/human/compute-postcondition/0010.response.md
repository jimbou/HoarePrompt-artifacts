Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and floor(n/2) inclusive multiplied by 2, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, req is an integer equal to k. If the second last element of b is not equal to the last element of b, l is a list containing the first element of b and the last element of b. Otherwise, ans1 is a list containing two elements equal to the last element of b, req is an integer equal to k + 2, and l is an empty list.***
