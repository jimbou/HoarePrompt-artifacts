Postcondition: ***The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement when k is 0 or -2, or continues execution with the current values of t, q, n, a, b, c, req, i, ans1, l, and k remaining unchanged. If c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], then ans2 has two additional elements which are both equal to c[i].***
