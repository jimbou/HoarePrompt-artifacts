Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is either -2 or not 0, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` is a list containing two times the value of `b[i]` for all `i` where `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, `ans2` is either an empty list or a list containing two times the value of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `req` is an integer equal to 0, `i` is 3, and `l` is either a list containing the first element of `b`, the last element of `b` and `b[i]` for all `i` where `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]` or an empty list depending on the second last element of `b`. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` is either -4 or not 0 minus 2, and `ans2` is a list containing two times the value of `c[i]`. Otherwise, `k` is either -2 or not 0.**
