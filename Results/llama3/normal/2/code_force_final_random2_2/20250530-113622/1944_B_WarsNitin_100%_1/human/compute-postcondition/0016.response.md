Output State: **t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer greater than 2, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing two times the value of b[i], ans2 is an empty list, req is an integer equal to 0, i is 1, l is either a list containing the first element of b and the last element of b or an empty list depending on the second last element of b, k is reduced by 2.**

The code block modifies the state of `ans1` by appending the value of `b[i]` twice, effectively doubling its value. The value of `k` is also reduced by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
