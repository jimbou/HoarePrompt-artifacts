Output State: **t is greater than 0, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an integer equal to 2 * k, i is 3, k is an integer equal to 2 * k - 2, ans1 is a list containing four instances of the current value of b[i], ans2 is an empty list, l is a list containing the value of b[i].**

The code snippet modifies the values of `ans1`, `k`, and does not affect any other variables. The first line appends the current value of `b[i]` to `ans1`, and the second line appends the current value of `b[i]` to `ans1` again. The third line decrements `k` by 2. The value of `i` is not changed, so `b[i]` remains the same. The value of `l` is also not changed, so it still contains the value of `b[i]`. The value of `req` is not changed, so it remains equal to 2 * k. The value of `ans2` is not changed, so it remains an empty list.
