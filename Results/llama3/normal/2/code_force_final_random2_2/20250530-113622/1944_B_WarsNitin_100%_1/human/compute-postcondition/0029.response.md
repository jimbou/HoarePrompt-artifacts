Postcondition: ***The program state remains unchanged if `k` is not equal to 0. If `k` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, with `t` being greater than 0, `q` being 0, `stdin` containing multiple test cases minus 1, `n` being an integer greater than 2, `a` being a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` being a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` being a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` contains four times the value of `b[i]` if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]` and `b[i]` is equal to `b[i + 1]`, otherwise `ans1` contains two times the value of `b[i]` if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is an integer equal to 0, `i` is 2, and `l` is either a list containing the first element of `b`, the last element of `b`, `b[i]` and `b[i]` if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, otherwise `l` is either a list containing the first element of `b`, the last element of `b` and `b[i]` or a list containing the first element of `b`, the last element of `b` and two times the value of `b[i]` if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, otherwise `l` is either a list containing the first element of `b` and the last element of `b` or an empty list depending on the second last element of `b`, and `k` is reduced by 2 if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`.***
