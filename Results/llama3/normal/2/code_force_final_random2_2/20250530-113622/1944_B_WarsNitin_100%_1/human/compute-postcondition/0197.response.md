Output State: **t is greater than 1, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an integer equal to 2 * k, i is n - 1, ans1 is a list containing two or four instances of the largest integer in b, ans2 is a list containing two instances of each pair of equal adjacent elements in c, l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, and if the first two elements of b are not equal, l also contains the last element of b and possibly some other elements from b, k is 0.**

The loop will execute until `i` reaches `n-1` or `k` becomes 0. In each iteration, if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i-1]`, `ans2` will have two additional elements equal to `c[i]` and `k` will be decreased by 2. If `k` becomes 0, the loop will break. At the end of the loop, `i` will be `n-1`, `ans2` will contain two instances of each pair of equal adjacent elements in `c`, and `k` will be 0. The other variables will remain unchanged.
