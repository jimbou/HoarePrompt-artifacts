Postcondition: ***t is greater than 1, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and must be at least 2, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an integer equal to 2 * k, i is 1, ans1 is a list containing two or four instances of the largest integer in b, ans2 is an empty list, l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, and if the first two elements of b are not equal, l also contains the last element of b and possibly some other elements from b, k is an integer equal to 2 * k. If k is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state. The current value of c[i] is equal to c[i - 1].***
