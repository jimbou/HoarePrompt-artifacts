To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `i` is initially 0, it should be adjusted to be within the range of `n`. Therefore, the adjusted state is:


State: **`i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `s` is 0, `c` is `k` squared divided by 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and another space-separated list of integers**
