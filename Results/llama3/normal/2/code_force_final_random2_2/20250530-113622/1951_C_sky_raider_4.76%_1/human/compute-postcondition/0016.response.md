Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, m is an integer, k is an integer minus the minimum of m and k minus the minimum of m and k, l is a sorted list of integers, s is the minimum of m and k, c is k squared divided by 2 plus l[0] times the minimum of m and k minus the square of the minimum of m and k divided by 2 plus l[1] times the minimum of m and k minus the square of the minimum of m and k divided by 2, i is 1, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.**

The first line assigns the minimum value between `m` and `k` to `s`. Since `s` is already the minimum of `m` and `k`, its value remains unchanged. The second line subtracts the value of `s` from `k`, effectively making `k` equal to `k` minus the minimum of `m` and `k` minus the minimum of `m` and `k`. The third line increments `c` by the value of `l[i]` times `s` minus the square of `s` divided by 2. Since `i` is 1, `l[i]` refers to the second element in the sorted list `l`. The value of `c` becomes `k` squared divided by 2 plus `l[0]` times the minimum of `m` and `k` minus the square of the minimum of `m` and `k` divided by 2 plus `l[1]` times the minimum of `m` and `k` minus the square of the minimum of `m` and `k` divided by 2. No other variables are affected.
