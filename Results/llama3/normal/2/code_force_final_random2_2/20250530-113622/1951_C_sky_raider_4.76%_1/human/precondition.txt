t is a positive integer, each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains three integers n, m, and k, where n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, and k is a positive integer such that k <= min(n*m, 10^9), the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where each a_i is a positive integer.
