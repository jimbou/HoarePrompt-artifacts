Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer, k is an integer minus the sum of the minimum of m and k for n times, l is a sorted list of integers, s is the minimum of m and k, c is k squared divided by 2 plus the sum of l[i] times the minimum of m and k minus the square of the minimum of m and k divided by 2 for i from 0 to n-1, i is n-1, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is:

* The value of `n` remains the same as the initial state.
* The value of `m` remains the same as the initial state.
* The value of `k` is reduced by the sum of the minimum of `m` and `k` for `n` times.
* The value of `l` remains the same as the initial state.
* The value of `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.
* The value of `c` is the sum of the initial value of `c` (which is `k` squared divided by 2) and the sum of `l[i]` times the minimum of `m` and `k` minus the square of the minimum of `m` and `k` divided by 2 for `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
* The value of `i` is `n-1`.
* The `stdin` is empty, meaning that all the inputs have been consumed.
