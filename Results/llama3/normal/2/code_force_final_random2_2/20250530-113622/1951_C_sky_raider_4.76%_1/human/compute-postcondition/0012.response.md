Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, l is a sorted list of integers, s is 0, c is k squared divided by 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and another space-separated list of integers, and the integer value of c is being printed**

In this final state, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the integer values read from the input. The list `l` is updated to a sorted list of integers read from the input. The variable `s` is reset to 0. The variable `c` is updated to the value of `k` squared divided by 2. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and another space-separated list of integers, and the integer value of `c` is being printed.
