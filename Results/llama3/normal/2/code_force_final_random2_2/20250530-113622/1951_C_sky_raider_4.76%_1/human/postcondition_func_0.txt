This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k, and the second line contains n integers. It sorts the integers, calculates a value c based on the sorted integers, the minimum of m and k, and the sum of the squares of the minimum of m and k, and prints the integer value of c. The function repeats this process for each test case, ultimately emptying the standard input.
