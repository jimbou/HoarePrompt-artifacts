Output State: **i is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, l is a sorted list of integers, s is 0, c is k squared divided by 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and another space-separated list of integers**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged as 0. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the first line of input. The list `l` contains a sorted list of integers obtained from the second line of input. The variable `s` is initialized to 0 and remains unchanged. The variable `c` is calculated as `k` squared divided by 2. Stdin now contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and another space-separated list of integers.
