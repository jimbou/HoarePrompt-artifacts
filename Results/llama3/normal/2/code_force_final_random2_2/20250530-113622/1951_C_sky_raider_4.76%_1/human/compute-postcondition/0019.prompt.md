Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, l is a sorted list of integers, s is 0, c is k squared divided by 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and another space-separated list of integers, and the integer value of c is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    s = min(m, k)
    k -= s
    c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, k is an integer minus the minimum of m and k, l is a sorted list of integers, s is the minimum of m and k, c is k squared divided by 2 plus l[0] times the minimum of m and k minus the square of the minimum of m and k divided by 2, i is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and another space-separated list of integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer greater than 1, m is an integer, k is an integer minus the minimum of m and k minus the minimum of m and k, l is a sorted list of integers, s is the minimum of m and k, c is k squared divided by 2 plus l[0] times the minimum of m and k minus the square of the minimum of m and k divided by 2 plus l[1] times the minimum of m and k minus the square of the minimum of m and k divided by 2, i is 1, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than 2, m is an integer, k is an integer minus the minimum of m and k minus the minimum of m and k minus the minimum of m and k, l is a sorted list of integers, s is the minimum of m and k, c is k squared divided by 2 plus l[0] times the minimum of m and k minus the square of the minimum of m and k divided by 2 plus l[1] times the minimum of m and k minus the square of the minimum of m and k divided by 2 plus l[2] times the minimum of m and k minus the square of the minimum of m and k divided by 2, i is 2, stdin is empty




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
