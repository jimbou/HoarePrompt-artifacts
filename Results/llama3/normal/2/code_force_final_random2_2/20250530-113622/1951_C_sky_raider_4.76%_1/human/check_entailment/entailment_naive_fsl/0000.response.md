Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets. The issue lies in the way the program updates the prices of the tickets after purchasing some tickets on a particular day. The program simply sorts the list of prices and then iterates over it, purchasing the maximum possible tickets on each day. However, this approach does not take into account the fact that the prices of the tickets increase by the number of tickets purchased on each day.

For example, consider the input:

4 2 3
8 6 4 2

The program will sort the prices as [2, 4, 6, 8] and then purchase 2 tickets on the first day (with price 2), 1 ticket on the second day (with price 4), and 0 tickets on the remaining days. However, this is not the optimal solution. A better approach would be to purchase 1 ticket on the third day (with price 4) and 2 tickets on the fourth day (with price 2 + 1 = 3), resulting in a total cost of 10.

The program does not consider this scenario and therefore produces an incorrect result.
