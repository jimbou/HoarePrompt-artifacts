The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer minus the minimum of `m` and `k` minus the minimum of `m` and `k`, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `k` squared divided by 2 plus `l[0]` times the minimum of `m` and `k` minus the square of the minimum of `m` and `k` divided by 2 plus `l[1]` times the minimum of `m` and `k` minus the square of the minimum of `m` and `k` divided by 2, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.**
