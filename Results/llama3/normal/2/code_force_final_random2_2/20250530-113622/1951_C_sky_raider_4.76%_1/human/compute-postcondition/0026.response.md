The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to its original value minus the minimum of `m` and `k`, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `k` squared divided by 2 plus the product of the first element of `l` and the minimum of `m` and `k` minus the square of the minimum of `m` and `k` divided by 2, `i` is 1, `stdin` is empty**
