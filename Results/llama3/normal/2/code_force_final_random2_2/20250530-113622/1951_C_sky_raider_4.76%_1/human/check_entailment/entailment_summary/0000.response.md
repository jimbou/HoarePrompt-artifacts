Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the greedy algorithm to solve the problem. The idea is to always buy the minimum of m and k tickets on the day with the lowest price, and then update the prices for the remaining days. The program correctly calculates the total cost by summing up the cost of buying tickets on each day and the additional cost due to the price increase.

The program also correctly handles the case where k is greater than the total number of tickets that can be bought in a day (i.e., n*m). In this case, the program will buy the maximum number of tickets on each day until k is reduced to 0.

The time complexity of the program is O(n log n) due to the sorting of the prices, where n is the number of days. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the prices.

Correctness: **True**
