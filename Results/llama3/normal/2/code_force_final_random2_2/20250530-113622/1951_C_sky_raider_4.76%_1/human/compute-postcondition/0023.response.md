Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, l is a sorted list of integers, s is 0, c is k squared divided by 2, i is not defined, stdin is empty**

The code snippet first reads three integer values from stdin and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`, respectively. This empties stdin. Then, it reads a list of integers from stdin, sorts them in ascending order, and assigns them to `l`. The variable `s` is set to 0, and `c` is calculated as `k` squared divided by 2. The variable `i` is not defined in the given code snippet, so its value is not changed.
