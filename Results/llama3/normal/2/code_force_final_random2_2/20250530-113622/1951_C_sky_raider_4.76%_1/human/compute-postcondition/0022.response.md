To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved are `i` and the input from `stdin`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be `n`.

The loop will execute again if there is another integer value in `stdin`. Since `stdin` is empty at the end of the previous iteration, we need to add another integer value to `stdin` for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `s`, and `c` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer minus the sum of the minimum of `m` and `k` for `n` times, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `k` squared divided by 2 plus the sum of `l[i]` times the minimum of `m` and `k` minus the square of the minimum of `m` and `k` divided by 2 for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `stdin` is not empty and contains an integer value**
