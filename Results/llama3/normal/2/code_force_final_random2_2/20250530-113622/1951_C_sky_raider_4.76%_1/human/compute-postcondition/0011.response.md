The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than the integer value returned by `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is `n`. Also, for the loop to execute again, `int(input())` must be greater than `n`. 
State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer minus `n` times `min(m, k)`, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is `k` squared divided by 2 plus the sum of the first `n` elements of `l` times `min(m, k)` minus `n` times `min(m, k)` squared divided by 2, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and another space-separated list of integers, and the integer value of `c` is being printed**
