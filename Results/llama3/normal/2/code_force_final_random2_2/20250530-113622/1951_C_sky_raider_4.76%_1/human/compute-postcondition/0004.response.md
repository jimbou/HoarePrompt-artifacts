The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer minus min(m, k), `l` is a sorted list of integers, `s` is min(m, k), `c` is k squared divided by 2 plus l[0] times min(m, k) minus min(m, k) squared divided by 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and another space-separated list of integers**
