Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of n zeros, i is n-1, el is '<'.**

In this output state, the code has modified the `suffZero` list by appending a new element, which is the sum of the last element in `suffZero` and `i + 1`. Since `i` is `n-1`, the new element is `n`. The variables `ol` and `zr` are assigned the values of `totalOne` and `len(suffZero) - 1`, respectively. However, these assignments do not affect the overall state, as `ol` and `zr` are not mentioned in the initial state. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
