Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, ans is a list of n zeros.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The string s1 remains unchanged, consisting of characters '<' and '>' of length n. The variable n also remains unchanged, being a positive integer. The list pre contains the indices of all '>' characters in s1, with indices being 1-indexed (i.e., the first character is at index 1, not 0). The variable totalOne is equal to the number of '>' characters in s1. The list preOne contains the cumulative sums of the indices of '>' characters in s1, starting from 0. The list suffZero contains a single element, which is 0. The list ans is initialized with n zeros.
