Output State: **n is a positive integer, s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1 minus 1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1 with the last element removed, suffZero is a list containing two or three elements: 0, n, and n + i, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is zeroInd - oneInd if el is '<' or the number of '>' characters is greater than 0, otherwise the last element is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi if el is '>' and the number of '>' characters is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the last element is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 if zr is less than or equal to ol and el is '<', i is n-3, el is the character at index n-3 in s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1 minus 1, zr is the second last index of suffZero, zeroInd is 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol) if ol <= zr, otherwise zeroInd is 2 * suffZero[-1], oneInd is 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1) if ol <= zr, otherwise oneInd is func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1), fi is func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr) if ol > zr, ans[i] is zeroInd - oneInd if ol <= zr, otherwise ans[i] is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi.**

The code modifies the initial state by removing the last element from the list `preOne` and decrementing the value of `totalOne` by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
