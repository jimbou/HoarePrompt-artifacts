Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1 minus one, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1 with the last element removed, suffZero is a list containing two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is zeroInd - oneInd if ol is less than or equal to zr, otherwise the last element is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi if el is '>' and the number of '>' characters is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the last element is zeroInd - oneInd if el is '>' and the number of '>' characters is greater than 0, i is n-2, el is either '<' or '>' depending on the character at index n-2 in s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1 minus one, zr is 1.**

The code snippet modifies the `preOne` list by removing the last element and decrements the `totalOne` variable by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The `preOne` list now contains one less cumulative sum of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, and the `totalOne` variable reflects the updated count of '>' characters in `s1`.
