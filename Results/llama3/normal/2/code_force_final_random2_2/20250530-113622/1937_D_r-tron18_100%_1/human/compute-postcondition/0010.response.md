Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1 minus 1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1 with the last element removed, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is zeroInd - oneInd if the number of '>' characters is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the last element is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi, i is n-1, el is '>', ol is the number of '>' characters in s1 minus 1, and zr is 0.**

The code modifies the state of the variables as follows:

*   `preOne` loses its last element, which was the cumulative sum of indices of '>' characters in `s1`.
*   `totalOne` is decremented by 1, reflecting the removal of one '>' character from `s1`.
*   The value of `ol` is updated to reflect the new total number of '>' characters in `s1`, which is `totalOne`.
*   The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
