Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two or three elements: 0, n, and n + i, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi, i is n-3, el is the character at index n-3 in s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is the second last index of suffZero, zeroInd is 2 * suffZero[-1], oneInd is func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1), fi is func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr), ans[i] is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi.**
