Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi, i is n-2, el is either '<' or '>' depending on the character at index n-2 in s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 1, zeroInd is 2 * n, oneInd is func_1(preOne, 1) + func_1(preOne, 2) - func_1(preOne, 1), fi is func_1(preOne, 2) - func_1(preOne, 1).**

The code modifies the values of `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, `fi`, and `ans[i]`. The value of `zeroInd` is set to `2 * n`, which is twice the length of the string `s1`. The value of `oneInd` is calculated using the function `func_1` and the list `preOne`, and it represents the sum of the indices of the '>' characters in `s1` at positions `zr` and `zr + 1`, minus the sum of the indices of the '>' characters in `s1` at position `1`. The value of `fi` is calculated as the difference between the sum of the indices of the '>' characters in `s1` at position `zr + 1` and the sum of the indices of the '>' characters in `s1` at position `zr`. The value of `ans[i]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, which represents the difference between the index of the last '>' character in `s1` and the index of the first '>' character in `s1`, plus the length of `s1` plus 1, minus the value of `fi`. The values of `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `i`, `el`, `ol`, and `zr` remain unchanged.
