Functionality: This function takes a string s1 of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>' as input and returns a list of n elements. The list contains the difference between the cumulative sum of indices of '<' characters and the cumulative sum of indices of '>' characters, with some adjustments based on the number of '>' characters and the last index of the cumulative sum of '<' characters. The function iterates over the input string from right to left, calculating the cumulative sums and differences for each character, and stores the results in the output list. The output list is then printed.
