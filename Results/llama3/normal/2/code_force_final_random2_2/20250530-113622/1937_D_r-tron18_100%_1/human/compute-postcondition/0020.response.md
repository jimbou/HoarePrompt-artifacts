Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s1` (1-indexed), `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing two elements: 0 and `n`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol` and `el` is '<', otherwise the last element is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi` if `el` is '>' and the number of '>' characters is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the last element is `zeroInd - oneInd` if `el` is '>' and the number of '>' characters is greater than 0, `i` is `n-2`, `el` is either '<' or '>' depending on the character at index `n-2` in `s1`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `el` has been assigned the value of the character at index `n-2` in the string `s1`, which can be either '<' or '>'. All other variables remain unchanged.
