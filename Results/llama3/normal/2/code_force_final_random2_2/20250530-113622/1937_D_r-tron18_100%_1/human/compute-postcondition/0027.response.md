Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing three elements: 0, n, and n + i + 1, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1, i is n-2, el is either '<' or '>' depending on the character at index n-2 in s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is the second last index of suffZero.**

The code block calculates the value of `zeroInd` by adding the last two elements of `suffZero`, which are `n + i + 1` and `n`. Then, it calculates the value of `oneInd` by calling the function `func_1` with `preOne` and `zr` as arguments and multiplying the result by 2. Finally, it assigns the value of `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` to `ans[i]`. The values of `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `i`, `el`, `ol`, and `zr` remain unchanged.
