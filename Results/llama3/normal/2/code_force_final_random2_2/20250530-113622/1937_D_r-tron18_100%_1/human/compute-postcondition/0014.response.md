Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1, i is n-1, el is '<', zr is less than or equal to ol.**

In this output state, the value of `ans[i]` has been updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, where `zeroInd` is the sum of the last two elements of `suffZero` (which is `n`) and `oneInd` is twice the result of `func_1(preOne, zr)`. The value of `i` remains `n-1`, and the value of `el` remains '<'. The relationship between `zr` and `ol` is maintained, with `zr` being less than or equal to `ol`. All other variables remain unchanged.
