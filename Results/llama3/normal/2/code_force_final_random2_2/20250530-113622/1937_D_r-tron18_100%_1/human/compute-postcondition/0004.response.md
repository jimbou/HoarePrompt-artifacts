Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s1` (1-indexed), `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is `n-1`, `el` is '>', `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, and `zr` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s1` still has a length of `n` and consists of '<' and '>' characters. The number of '>' characters in `s1` is still stored in `totalOne`. The list `pre` still contains the indices of '>' characters in `s1` (1-indexed), and the list `preOne` still contains the cumulative sums of these indices. The list `suffZero` still contains a single element 0. The list `ans` still contains `n` zeros. The variable `i` is still `n-1`, and the current value of `el` is still '>'. Two new variables `ol` and `zr` have been introduced, where `ol` is equal to the number of '>' characters in `s1` (i.e., `totalOne`), and `zr` is 0.
