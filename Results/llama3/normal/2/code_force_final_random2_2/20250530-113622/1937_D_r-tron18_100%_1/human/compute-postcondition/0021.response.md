Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s1` (1-indexed), `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing two elements: 0 and `n`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol` and `el` is '<', otherwise the last element is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi` if `el` is '>' and the number of '>' characters is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the last element is `zeroInd - oneInd` if `el` is '>' and the number of '>' characters is greater than 0, `i` is `n-2`, `el` is either '<' or '>' depending on the character at index `n-2` in `s1`, `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `zr` is 1.**

In this output state, the values of `ol` and `zr` have been updated. `ol` is now equal to the number of '>' characters in `s1`, which is the same as `totalOne`. `zr` is now equal to 1, which is the second last element of `suffZero`. The other variables remain unchanged.
