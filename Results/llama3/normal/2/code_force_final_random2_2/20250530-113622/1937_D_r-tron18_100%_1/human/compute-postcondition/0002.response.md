Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s1` (1-indexed), `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is `n-1`, `el` is either '<' or '>' depending on the character at index `i` in `s1`.**

In this output state, the value of `el` is determined by the character at index `i` in `s1`, which can be either '<' or '>'. The other variables remain unchanged, as the code only assigns a value to `el` without modifying any other variables.
