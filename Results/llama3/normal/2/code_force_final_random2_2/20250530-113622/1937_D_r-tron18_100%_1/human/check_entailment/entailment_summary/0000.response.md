Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave a grid of length n, where each cell contains a character '<' or '>'. The pinball moves according to specific rules, and the goal is to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query.

Function 1, `func_1`, calculates the difference between the last element of a list and an element a specified number of positions from the end, wrapping around to the start of the list if necessary. This function is used in Function 2 to calculate the cumulative sum of indices of '>' characters and the cumulative sum of indices of '<' characters.

Function 2, `func_2`, takes a string s1 of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>' as input and returns a list of n elements. The list contains the difference between the cumulative sum of indices of '>' characters and the cumulative sum of indices of '<' characters, with some adjustments based on the number of '>' characters and the last index of the cumulative sum of indices of '<' characters. The function calculates this difference for each character in the input string and returns the resulting list.

The provided execution summaries suggest that Function 1 is used to calculate the cumulative sum of indices of '>' characters and the cumulative sum of indices of '<' characters, and Function 2 uses these cumulative sums to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query.

Based on the problem description and the execution summaries, it appears that the functions are designed to work together to solve the problem. Function 1 provides the necessary calculations for Function 2, which then uses these calculations to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query.

Therefore, based on the provided information, it seems that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
