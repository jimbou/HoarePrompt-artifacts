Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing three elements: 0, n, and 2n - 2, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is zeroInd - oneInd if el is '<' or the number of '>' characters is greater than 0, otherwise the last element is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi if el is '>' and the number of '>' characters is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the last element is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 if zr is less than or equal to ol and el is '<', i is n-3, el is the character at index n-3 in s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 2, zeroInd is 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1), oneInd is 2 * preOne[-1], ans[i] is zeroInd - oneInd.**

The code snippet provided does not modify any variables in the initial state. The variables `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on the existing values of `suffZero`, `ol`, `preOne`, but these calculations do not change the values of `suffZero`, `ol`, or `preOne`. The value of `ans[i]` is updated based on the calculated values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd`, but this does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of the calculated values of `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `ans[i]`.
