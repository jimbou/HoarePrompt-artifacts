You will be given an **initial state** (precondition) and a **Python code snippet** containing a `print` statement. Your task is to calculate the postcondition, by enhancing the precondition with what is being printed.

If a variable or object has a known **explicit value**, use that value in the output.
If a variable or object is defined by a **formula or condition**, describe its value using the given information.
Always provide the most **precise** description possible based on the precondition.
Format the final output as:  Output: **the postcondition including what is being printed**.
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task:


Example1:
Initial State: `arr` is a list containing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 'sum' is the sum of all elements in the list `arr`
```
print(arr[2], sum)
```
Example Answer:
The code prints the element at index 2 of the list `arr` which is 3, and the value of `sum` which is the sum of all elements in the list `arr` which is 15.
Output: **`arr` is a list containing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 'sum' is the sum of all elements in the list `arr` , the 3rd element of the list which is 3 and the sum which is equal to 15 is being printed**

Example2:
Initial State: The points list is a list of points. The `shoelace_sum` is the sum of all terms calculated as \(x_1 * y_2 - y_1 * x_2\) for each consecutive pair of points in the `points` list, the `area` is the absolute value of `shoelace_sum` divided by 2.0, `i` is equal to `len(points) - 2`, and `x1` is the first element of `points[i]`, `y1` is the second element of `points[i]`, while `x2` is the first element of `points[i + 1]`, and `y2` is the second element of `points[i + 1]`.
```
print(area)
```
Example Answer:
The `print(area)` statement will print the calculated area of the polygon formed by the points in the `points` list.
Since the exact `points` list is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `area`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated area.
Output: ** The points list is a list of points. The `shoelace_sum` is the sum of all terms calculated as \(x_1 * y_2 - y_1 * x_2\) for each consecutive pair of points in the `points` list, the `area` is the absolute value of `shoelace_sum` divided by 2.0, `i` is equal to `len(points) - 2`, and `x1` is the first element of `points[i]`, `y1` is the second element of `points[i]`, while `x2` is the first element of `points[i + 1]`, and `y2` is the second element of `points[i + 1]`, and area is printed ,area (where area is the area of the polygon formed by the points in the `points` list)**

Example3:
Initial State: `balances` is a list of integers, `A` is the first element of the balances list, `B` is the second element of the balances list, and the amount is an integer  less than or equal to A.
```
print(f"The amount amount is less than or equal to A")
```
Example Answer:
The code prints a formatted string indicating whether the amount is less than or equal to A. Where A is the first element of the balances list and amount is an integer less than or equal to A.
Output: ** `balances` is a list of integers, `A` is the first element of the balances list, `B` is the second element of the balances list, and the amount is an integer  less than or equal to A., and this si printed: "The amount [amount] is less than or equal to [A]"**
Your Task:
Initial State: s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing n+1 elements: 0, n, n + i + 1, ..., n + (n-1) + 1, ans is a list of n elements where each element is zeroInd - oneInd if el is '<' or the number of '>' characters is greater than 0, otherwise the last element is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi if el is '>' and the number of '>' characters is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the last element is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 if zr is less than or equal to ol and el is '<', i is -1, el is the character at index 0 in s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is the last index of suffZero, zeroInd is 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1) if ol is less than or equal to zr, otherwise zeroInd is 2 * suffZero[-1], oneInd is 2 * preOne[-1] if zr is less than or equal to ol, otherwise oneInd is func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1), fi is func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr) if ol is greater than zr, ans[i] is zeroInd - oneInd if ol is less than or equal to zr, otherwise ans[i] is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi.
```
print(*ans)

```
Now, please think step by step. Based on the precondition which describes the state of the program, variables , objects etc before the code is executed, calculate what will be the postcondition by adding in the precondition what is being printed. Include the values of the variables, objects etc. that are printed.
Use natural language to describe the output, easily understandable by a human and strictly adhere to the format Output: **the postcondition including what is being printed**.
