Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing three elements: 0, n, and 2n - 2, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1, i is n-3, el is the character at index n-3 in s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 2, zeroInd is 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1), oneInd is 2 * func_1(preOne, zr), ans[i] is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1.**

The code modifies the values of `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `ans[i]`. The first line calculates `zeroInd` as the sum of the last two elements of `suffZero`, which is `2n - 2 + n = 3n - 2`. The second line calculates `oneInd` as twice the result of `func_1(preOne, zr)`, which is `2 * func_1(preOne, 2)`. The third line updates `ans[i]` to be `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, which is `(3n - 2) - 2 * func_1(preOne, 2) + n + 1 = 4n - 1 - 2 * func_1(preOne, 2)`. The values of `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `i`, `el`, `ol`, and `zr` remain unchanged.
