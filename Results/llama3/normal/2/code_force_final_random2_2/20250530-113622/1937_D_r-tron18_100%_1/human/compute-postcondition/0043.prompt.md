Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, ans is a list of n zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    el = s1[i]
    if el == '>':
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if ol <= zr:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
            oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
            oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
            fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
        preOne.pop()
        totalOne -= 1
    else:
        suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if zr <= ol:
            zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
            oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 if zr is less than or equal to ol and el is '<', otherwise the last element is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi if el is '>' and the number of '>' characters is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the last element is zeroInd - oneInd if el is '>' and the number of '>' characters is greater than 0, i is n-1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two or three elements: 0, n, and n + i + 1, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is zeroInd - oneInd if el is '<' or the number of '>' characters is greater than 0, otherwise the last element is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi if el is '>' and the number of '>' characters is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the last element is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 if zr is less than or equal to ol and el is '<', i is n-2, el is either '<' or '>' depending on the character at index n-2 in s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 1 or the second last index of suffZero, zeroInd is 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1), oneInd is 2 * preOne[-1], ans[i] is zeroInd - oneInd.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s1` (1-indexed), `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing two or three elements: 0, `n`, and `n + i`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is `zeroInd - oneInd` if `el` is '<' or the number of '>' characters is greater than 0, otherwise the last element is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi` if `el` is '>' and the number of '>' characters is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the last element is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol` and `el` is '<', `i` is `n-3`, `el` is the character at index `n-3` in `s1`, `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `zr` is 1 or the second last index of `suffZero`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` if `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, otherwise `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, otherwise `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol` is greater than `zr`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd` if `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, otherwise `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
