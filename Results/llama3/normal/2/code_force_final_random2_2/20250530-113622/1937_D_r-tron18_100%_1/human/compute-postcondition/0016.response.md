Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is zeroInd - oneInd, i is n-1, el is '<'. zr is larger than ol**

The code calculates the index of the next zero character (zeroInd) and the index of the next one character (oneInd) using the provided functions func_1 and the lists suffZero and preOne. The value of ans[i] is then updated to be the difference between zeroInd and oneInd. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
