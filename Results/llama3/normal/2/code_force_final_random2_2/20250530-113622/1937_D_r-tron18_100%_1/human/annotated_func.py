    #This is printed: A list of n elements, where each element is either zeroInd - oneInd or zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi, depending on the conditions specified in the precondition, where zeroInd and oneInd are calculated based on the cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters and the last index of suffZero, and fi is calculated based on the difference of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters at specific indices.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function takes a string s1 of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>' as input and returns a list of n elements. The list contains the difference between the cumulative sum of indices of '>' characters and the cumulative sum of indices of '<' characters, with some adjustments based on the number of '>' characters and the last index of the cumulative sum of indices of '<' characters. The function calculates this difference for each character in the input string and returns the resulting list.
