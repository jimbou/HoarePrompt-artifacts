Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing three elements: 0, n, and n + i + 1, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 if zr is less than or equal to ol and el is '<', otherwise the last element is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi if el is '>' and the number of '>' characters is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the last element is zeroInd - oneInd if el is '>' and the number of '>' characters is greater than 0, i is n-2, el is either '<' or '>' depending on the character at index n-2 in s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is the second last index of suffZero.**

The code modifies the `suffZero` list by appending a new element, which is the sum of the last element of `suffZero` and `i + 1`. The value of `i` is `n-2`, so the new element appended to `suffZero` is `n + (n-2) + 1 = 2n - 1`. The variables `ol` and `zr` are assigned the values of `totalOne` and `len(suffZero) - 1`, respectively. The value of `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, and the value of `len(suffZero) - 1` is the second last index of `suffZero`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
