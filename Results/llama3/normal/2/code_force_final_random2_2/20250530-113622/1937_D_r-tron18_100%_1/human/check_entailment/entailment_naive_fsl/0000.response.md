Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query.

The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to solve the problem. `func_1` is a helper function that calculates the difference between the last element and the element at a certain index in an array. `func_2` is the main function that takes a string `s1` and an integer `n` as input and calculates the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query.

The program first initializes two arrays, `pre` and `suffZero`, to keep track of the indices of the '>' characters and the cumulative sum of the indices of the '<' characters, respectively. It then iterates over the string `s1` from right to left and calculates the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query.

The program correctly handles the cases where the pinball moves to the left or right and inverts the character at the current index. It also correctly handles the cases where the pinball leaves the grid from the left or right border.

I have tested the program with several examples and it produces the correct output for all of them. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
