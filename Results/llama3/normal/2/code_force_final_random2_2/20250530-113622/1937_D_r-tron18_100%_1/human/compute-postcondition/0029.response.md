Postcondition: ***s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing three elements: 0, n, and n + i + 1, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 if zr is less than or equal to ol and el is '<', otherwise the last element is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi if el is '>' and the number of '>' characters is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the last element is zeroInd - oneInd if el is '>' and the number of '>' characters is greater than 0, i is n-2, el is either '<' or '>' depending on the character at index n-2 in s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is the second last index of suffZero, zeroInd is 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1), oneInd is 2 * preOne[-1], ans[i] is zeroInd - oneInd.***
