Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing n+1 elements: 0, n, n + i + 1, ..., n + (n-1) + 1, ans is a list of n elements where each element is zeroInd - oneInd if el is '<' or the number of '>' characters is greater than 0, otherwise the last element is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi if el is '>' and the number of '>' characters is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the last element is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 if zr is less than or equal to ol and el is '<', i is -1, el is the character at index 0 in s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is the last index of suffZero, zeroInd is 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1) if ol is less than or equal to zr, otherwise zeroInd is 2 * suffZero[-1], oneInd is 2 * preOne[-1] if zr is less than or equal to ol, otherwise oneInd is func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1), fi is func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr) if ol is greater than zr, ans[i] is zeroInd - oneInd if ol is less than or equal to zr, otherwise ans[i] is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the string s1 remains unchanged, the list pre remains unchanged, the number of '>' characters in s1 (totalOne) remains unchanged, the list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1 (preOne) remains unchanged, the list suffZero contains n+1 elements where each element is the cumulative sum of indices of '<' characters in s1, and the list ans contains n elements where each element is the difference between the cumulative sum of indices of '<' characters and the cumulative sum of indices of '>' characters, adjusted based on the number of '>' characters and the index of the current character. The loop head and body variables i, el, ol, zr, zeroInd, oneInd, and fi are updated accordingly.
