Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s1` (1-indexed), `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing two or three elements: 0, `n`, and `n + i`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is `zeroInd - oneInd` if `el` is '<' or the number of '>' characters is greater than 0, otherwise the last element is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi` if `el` is '>' and the number of '>' characters is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the last element is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol` and `el` is '<', `i` is `n-3`, `el` is the character at index `n-3` in `s1`, `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `zr` is 1 or the second last index of `suffZero`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.**

In this output state, the value of `el` has been updated to the character at index `n-3` in `s1`, which can be either '<' or '>'. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
