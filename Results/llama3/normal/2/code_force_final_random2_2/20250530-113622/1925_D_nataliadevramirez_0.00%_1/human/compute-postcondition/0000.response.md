Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `friendships` is a list of lists of three integers, `t` is an integer, stdin contains one input: an integer**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` remain unchanged. The variable `t` is assigned the value of an integer from the input, which is now empty since it has been read. The stdin now contains no input.
