The code prints the value of `result`, which is the return value of the function `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`. The function `func_1` is not defined in the given code snippet, so we cannot determine its exact behavior. However, based on the precondition, we know that `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers, and `friendships` is a list of lists of three integers.

Output: **the return value of func_1(n, m, k, friendships) (where n, m, and k are integers, and friendships is a list of lists of three integers)**
