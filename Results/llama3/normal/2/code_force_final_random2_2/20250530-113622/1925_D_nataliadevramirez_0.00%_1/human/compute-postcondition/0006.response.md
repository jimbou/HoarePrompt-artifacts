Output State: **n, m, and k are integers, friendships is a list of lists of three integers, result is the return value of func_1(n, m, k, friendships), t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 1**

The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`, respectively. It then reads `m` lines of input, each containing three integers, and stores them in the `friendships` list. The `func_1` function is called with `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` as arguments, and its return value is assigned to `result`. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
