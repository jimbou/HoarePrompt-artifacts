Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The issue lies in the fact that the program does not take into account the probability of choosing a pair of friends in each excursion.

In the problem description, it is mentioned that the teacher chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. This means that the probability of choosing a pair of friends is not constant, but rather depends on the number of pairs of friends and the total number of children.

The program simply multiplies the friendship value of each pair by the sum of the first k positive integers (k * (k + 1) // 2), which is not correct. The correct approach would be to calculate the probability of choosing a pair of friends in each excursion and then multiply the friendship value by this probability.

For example, consider the case where there are 3 children, 2 pairs of friends, and 2 excursions. The program would calculate the expected value as 2 * (2 * (2 + 1) // 2) = 6, which is incorrect. The correct expected value would be calculated by considering the probability of choosing each pair of friends in each excursion, which would result in a different value.
