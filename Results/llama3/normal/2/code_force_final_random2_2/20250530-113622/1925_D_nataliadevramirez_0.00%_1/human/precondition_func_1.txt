n, m, and k are positive integers, friendships is a list of lists of three integers, where each sublist contains the indices of a pair of children who are friends and their friendship value, 1 <= n <= 10^5, 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), 1 <= k <= 2*10^5, 1 <= f_i <= 10^9, and a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n.
