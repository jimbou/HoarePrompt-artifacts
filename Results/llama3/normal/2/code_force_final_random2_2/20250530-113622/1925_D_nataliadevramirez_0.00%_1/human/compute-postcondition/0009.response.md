To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` needs to be decremented by 1.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers, `friendships` is a list of lists of three integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 2**
