Output State: **n, m, and k are positive integers, friendships is a list of lists of three integers, result is the return value of func_1(n, m, k, friendships), t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the values provided as input. The `friendships` list is populated with `m` lists of three integers each, which are also provided as input. The `result` variable is assigned the return value of the `func_1` function, which takes `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` as arguments. The value of `t` is still greater than 0, and the value of `_` remains 0.
