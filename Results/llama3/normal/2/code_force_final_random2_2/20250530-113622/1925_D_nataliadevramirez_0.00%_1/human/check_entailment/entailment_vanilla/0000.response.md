Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`. It calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values by iterating over each friendship and adding the product of the friendship value and the sum of the first `k` positive integers (i.e., `k * (k + 1) // 2`) to the result. The result is then returned modulo `MOD` (which is not defined in the provided code, but it is assumed to be a large prime number, typically `10^9 + 7`).

`func_2` reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the result.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1.  The program does not calculate the probability of choosing a pair of friends, which is essential for finding the expected value. The probability of choosing a pair of friends is `1 / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`, where `n` is the number of children.
2.  The program does not consider the increase in friendship value for each excursion. The friendship value of a pair of friends increases by 1 for each excursion, so the expected value should take this into account.
3.  The program does not calculate the modular inverse of `q` (which is `n * (n - 1) // 2`) modulo `MOD`, which is required to find the final answer.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be modified to calculate the probability of choosing a pair of friends, consider the increase in friendship value for each excursion, and calculate the modular inverse of `q` modulo `MOD`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
    prob = pow(total_pairs, MOD - 2, MOD)  # modular inverse of total_pairs
    result = 0
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b, f) = friendships[i]
        result += f * k * prob % MOD
        result += (k * (k - 1) // 2) * prob % MOD
    return result % MOD

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        print(result)

func_2()
```

Correctness: **False**
