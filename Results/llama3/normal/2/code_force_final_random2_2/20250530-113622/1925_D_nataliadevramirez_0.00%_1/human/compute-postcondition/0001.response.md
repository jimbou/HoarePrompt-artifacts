The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `friendships` is a list of lists of three integers, and stdin contains one input: an integer. These states do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0. 

State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `friendships` is a list of lists of three integers, stdin contains one input: an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
