The code prints the value of the variable `result`, which is the return value of the function `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `result`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the function call.

Output: **result (where result is the return value of func_1(n, m, k, friendships))**
