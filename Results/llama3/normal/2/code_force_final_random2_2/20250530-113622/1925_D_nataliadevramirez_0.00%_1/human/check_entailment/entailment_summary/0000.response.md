Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. 

Function func_1 calculates the sum of a weighted arithmetic series for each tuple in a list of friendships. The weight is the product of a frequency value and the sum of the first k positive integers. The function takes as input a positive integer n, a non-negative integer m, a positive integer k, and a list of m tuples containing three positive integers a, b, and f. It returns the remainder of this sum divided by a constant modulus.

Function func_2 is the main function that accepts the input data, processes it, and prints the result. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of children, the number of friendships, a value k, and a list of friendships. It then calls func_1 with these inputs and prints the result.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The func_1 function correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values, and the func_2 function correctly reads the input data and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
