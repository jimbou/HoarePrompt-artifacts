Output State: **n, m, and k are integers, friendships is a list of lists of three integers, result is the return value of func_1(n, m, k, friendships), t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, _ is t-1, and the return value of func_1(n, m, k, friendships) which is stored in result is being printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of n, m, and k will be the last values read from the input, friendships will be the last list of friendships read from the input, result will be the last result calculated by func_1, t will be the same as the initial value (since it's not modified inside the loop), and _ will be one less than t (since it's the loop counter). The return value of func_1, which is stored in result, is being printed.
