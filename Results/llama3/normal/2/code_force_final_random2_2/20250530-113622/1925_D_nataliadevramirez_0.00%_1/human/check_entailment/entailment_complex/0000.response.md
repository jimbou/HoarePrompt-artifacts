Reasoning: 

The problem requires finding the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The given program calculates this expected value by summing up the product of each friendship value and the sum of the first k positive integers, and then returns the remainder of this sum divided by a constant modulus.

However, the program does not correctly calculate the expected value. The expected value should be the sum of the products of each friendship value and the probability of choosing that pair of friends, which is 1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2), multiplied by the sum of the first k positive integers. The program does not take into account the probability of choosing each pair of friends.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
