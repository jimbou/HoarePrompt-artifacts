Based on the precondition, the code will print the value of the variable `result`, which is the return value of the function `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the precondition, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. However, we can describe the value of `result` based on the information provided.

`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, and `friendships` is a list of lists of three integers. The function `func_1` takes these values as input and returns a value, which is stored in the variable `result`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the value returned by the function `func_1` when called with the input values `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`.

Output: **the return value of func_1(n, m, k, friendships)**
