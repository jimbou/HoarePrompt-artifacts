Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The program uses a function `func_1` to calculate this expected value, which takes the number of children `n`, the number of pairs of friends `m`, the number of excursions `k`, and a list of friendships as input.

The function `func_1` iterates over each pair of friends, calculates the sum of the friendship value `f` multiplied by the sum of the first `k` positive integers (i.e., `k * (k + 1) // 2`), and adds this sum to the result. The result is then returned modulo `MOD` (which is `10^9 + 7`).

However, this approach is incorrect. The problem statement asks for the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions, but the given program calculates the sum of the products of the friendship values and the sum of the first k positive integers.

The correct approach would be to calculate the probability of each pair of friends being chosen in each excursion, and then multiply this probability by the friendship value and sum over all pairs and excursions.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
