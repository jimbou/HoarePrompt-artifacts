Output State: **n, m, and k are integers, friendships is a list of lists of three integers, result is the return value of func_1(n, m, k, friendships), t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 2**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`, respectively. The second line reads `m` lines from stdin, where each line contains three integers, and assigns them to `friendships` as a list of lists. The third line calls the function `func_1` with the updated values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` as arguments and assigns the return value to `result`.

After executing the code, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the integers read from stdin. The value of `friendships` is updated to a list of lists of three integers, where each inner list represents a line read from stdin. The value of `result` is updated to the return value of `func_1` with the updated arguments. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
