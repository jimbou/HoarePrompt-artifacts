This function calculates the sum of a weighted arithmetic series for each tuple in a list of friendships, where the weight is the product of a frequency value and the sum of the first k positive integers, and returns the remainder of this sum divided by a constant modulus. The function takes as input a positive integer n, a non-negative integer m, a positive integer k, and a list of m tuples containing three positive integers a, b, and f, and returns a single integer value.
