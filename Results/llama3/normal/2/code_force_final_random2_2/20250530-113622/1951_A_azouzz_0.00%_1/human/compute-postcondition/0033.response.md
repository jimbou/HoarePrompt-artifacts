The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1 and `t` must be decreased by 1. So `_` is 1 and `t` is greater than 0 but less than the previous value.
State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than the previous value, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each with two inputs: a binary string of the same length as the integer that was just accepted and another integer and a binary string of the same length as the integer, n is an integer equal to the integer just accepted from stdin, s is a binary string equal to the binary string just accepted from stdin, cnt1 is the number of '1' in s, _ is 1**
