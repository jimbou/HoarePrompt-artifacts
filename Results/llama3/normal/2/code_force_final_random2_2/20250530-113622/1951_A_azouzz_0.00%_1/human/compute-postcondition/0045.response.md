Postcondition: **t is greater than 0 but less than the previous value, n is an integer equal to the integer just accepted from stdin, s is a binary string equal to the binary string just accepted from stdin, cnt1 is the number of '1' in s, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each with two inputs: a binary string of the same length as the integer that was just accepted and another integer and a binary string of the same length as the integer. If cnt1 is greater than 2 and cnt1 is even, 'YES' is printed. If cnt1 is greater than 2 and cnt1 is odd or cnt1 equals 1, 'NO' is printed. If cnt1 is not greater than 2 and cnt1 is even and not equal to 1, then if '11' is in s, 'NO' is printed, otherwise 'YES' is printed.**
