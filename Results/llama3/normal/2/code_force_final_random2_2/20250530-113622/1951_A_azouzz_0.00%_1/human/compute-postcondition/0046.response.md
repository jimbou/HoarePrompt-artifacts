Output State: **t is 0, stdin is empty, n is an integer equal to the integer just accepted from stdin, s is a binary string equal to the binary string just accepted from stdin, cnt1 is the number of '1' in s, _ is t. If cnt1 is greater than 2 and cnt1 is even, 'YES' is printed. If cnt1 is greater than 2 and cnt1 is odd or cnt1 equals 1, 'NO' is printed. If cnt1 is not greater than 2 and cnt1 is even and not equal to 1, then if '11' is in s, 'NO' is printed, otherwise 'YES' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the value of `t` is now 0. The input buffer `stdin` is empty, and the variables `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` hold the values of the last test case processed. The loop counter `_` is equal to the initial value of `t`. The output is determined by the same conditions as before, based on the value of `cnt1` and the presence of the substring '11' in `s`.
