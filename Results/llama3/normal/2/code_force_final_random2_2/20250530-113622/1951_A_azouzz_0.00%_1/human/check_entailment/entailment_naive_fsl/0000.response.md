Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input string `s` contains a single '1' and `n` is greater than 1. In this case, the program will print 'NO', but the correct output should be 'YES' because it is possible to turn on the single lamp.

For example, if the input is `n = 3` and `s = '100'`, the program will print 'NO', but the correct output should be 'YES' because it is possible to turn on the first lamp.

The program's logic is incorrect because it checks if `cnt1 > 2` and then checks if `cnt1 % 2 == 0` or `cnt1 % 2 == 1`. However, it does not handle the case where `cnt1 == 1` correctly.
