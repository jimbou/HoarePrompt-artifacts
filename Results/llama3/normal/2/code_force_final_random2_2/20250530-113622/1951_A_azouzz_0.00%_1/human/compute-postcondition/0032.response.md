Postcondition: **t is greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each with two inputs: a binary string of the same length as the integer that was just accepted and another integer and a binary string of the same length as the integer, n is an integer equal to the integer just accepted from stdin, s is a binary string equal to the binary string just accepted from stdin, cnt1 is the number of '1' in s. If cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 is even, 'YES' is printed. If cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 is odd or cnt1 is 1, or if '11' is in s, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**
