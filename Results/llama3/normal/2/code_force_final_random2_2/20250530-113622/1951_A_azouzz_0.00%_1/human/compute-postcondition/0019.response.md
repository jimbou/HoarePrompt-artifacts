Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each with two inputs: a binary string of the same length as the integer that was just accepted and another integer and a binary string of the same length as the integer, n is an integer, s is a binary string, cnt1 is the number of '1' in s. If cnt1 is greater than 2 and an even number, 'YES' is printed. If cnt1 is greater than 2 and an odd number, 'NO' is printed. If cnt1 is less than or equal to 2, then if the binary string s contains the substring '11', 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.***
