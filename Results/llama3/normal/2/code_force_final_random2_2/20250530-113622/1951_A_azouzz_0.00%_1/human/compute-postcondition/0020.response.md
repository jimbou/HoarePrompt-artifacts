The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, t must be decreased by 1.
State: **t is greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each with two inputs: a binary string of the same length as the integer that was just accepted and another integer and a binary string of the same length as the integer, n is an integer, s is a binary string, cnt1 is the number of '1' in s. If cnt1 is greater than 2 and an even number, 'YES' is printed. If cnt1 is greater than 2 and an odd number, 'NO' is printed. If cnt1 is less than or equal to 2, then if the binary string s contains the substring '11', 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**
