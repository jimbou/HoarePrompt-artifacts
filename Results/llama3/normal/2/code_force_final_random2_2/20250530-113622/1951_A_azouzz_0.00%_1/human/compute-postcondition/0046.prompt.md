Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer and less than or equal to 50, stdin contains multiple test cases, each with two inputs: a binary string of the same length as the integer that was just accepted and another integer and a binary string of the same length as the integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    cnt1 = s.count('1')
    if cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif cnt1 > 2 and (cnt1 % 2 == 1 or cnt1 == 1):
        print('NO')
    elif '11' in s:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each with two inputs: a binary string of the same length as the integer that was just accepted and another integer and a binary string of the same length as the integer, n is an integer, s is a binary string, cnt1 is the number of '1' in s. If cnt1 is greater than 2 and an even number, 'YES' is printed. If cnt1 is greater than 2 and an odd number, 'NO' is printed. If cnt1 is less than or equal to 2, then if the binary string s contains the substring '11', 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each with two inputs: a binary string of the same length as the integer that was just accepted and another integer and a binary string of the same length as the integer, n is an integer equal to the integer just accepted from stdin, s is a binary string equal to the binary string just accepted from stdin, cnt1 is the number of '1' in s. If cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 is even, 'YES' is printed. If cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 is odd or cnt1 is 1, or if '11' is in s, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 0 but less than the previous value, n is an integer equal to the integer just accepted from stdin, s is a binary string equal to the binary string just accepted from stdin, cnt1 is the number of '1' in s, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each with two inputs: a binary string of the same length as the integer that was just accepted and another integer and a binary string of the same length as the integer. If cnt1 is greater than 2 and cnt1 is even, 'YES' is printed. If cnt1 is greater than 2 and cnt1 is odd or cnt1 equals 1, 'NO' is printed. If cnt1 is not greater than 2 and cnt1 is even and not equal to 1, then if '11' is in s, 'NO' is printed, otherwise 'YES' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
