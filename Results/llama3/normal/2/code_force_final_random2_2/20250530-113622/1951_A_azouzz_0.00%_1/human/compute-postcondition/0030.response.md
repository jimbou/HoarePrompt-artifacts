Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each with two inputs: a binary string of the same length as the integer that was just accepted and another integer and a binary string of the same length as the integer, n is an integer equal to the integer just accepted from stdin, s is a binary string equal to the binary string just accepted from stdin, cnt1 is the number of '1' in s. If '11' is in s, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.***
