The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, each with two inputs: an integer and a binary string of the same length as the integer. The integer is a positive integer and less than or equal to 50. After accepting the first integer, the stdin now contains multiple test cases, each with two inputs: a binary string of the same length as the integer that was just accepted and another integer and a binary string of the same length as the integer. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer and less than or equal to 50, stdin contains multiple test cases, each with two inputs: a binary string of the same length as the integer that was just accepted and another integer and a binary string of the same length as the integer.**
