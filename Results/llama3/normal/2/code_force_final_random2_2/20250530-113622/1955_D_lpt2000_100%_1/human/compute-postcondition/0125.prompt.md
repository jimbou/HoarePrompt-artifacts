Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nabors` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two lists of integers a and b of lengths n and m respectively, where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(nabors):
    n, m, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    aa = [str(i) for i in input().split()]
    bb = [str(i) for i in input().split()]
    cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
    cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
    D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
    pairs_in_D = sum(D.values())
    E = cnt_aa - D
    C = cnt_bb - D
    fnd = 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
    for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
        if D[out_aa] > 0:
            if E[out_aa] > 0:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            else:
                D[out_aa] -= 1
                pairs_in_D -= 1
                C[out_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        if C[in_aa] > 0:
            D[in_aa] += 1
            pairs_in_D += 1
            C[in_aa] -= 1
        else:
            E[in_aa] += 1
        fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
    print(fnd)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and n, k is an integer between 1 and m, aa is a list of strings of length n and n is greater than m, bb is a list of strings of length m, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in aa[:m], cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, pairs_in_D is an integer representing the total count of common elements, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, fnd is 1 if pairs_in_D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, _ is 0, nabors is at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, in_aa is the last element in aa[m:], out_aa is the last element in aa[:n - m]. If C[in_aa] is greater than 0, then D[in_aa] is increased by 1, pairs_in_D is increased by 1, and C[in_aa] is decreased by 1. If C[in_aa] is not greater than 0, then E[in_aa] is incremented by 1. If D[out_aa] is greater than 0, then if E[out_aa] is greater than 0, E[out_aa] is decremented by 1. Otherwise, D[out_aa] is decreased by 1, pairs_in_D is decreased by 1, and C[out_aa] is increased by 1. If D[out_aa] is not greater than 0, then E[out_aa] is decremented by 1, and the value of fnd is printed, which is 1 if the number of common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and n, k is an integer between 1 and m, aa is a list of strings of length n, bb is a list of strings of length m, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in aa[:m], cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, pairs_in_D is an integer representing the total count of common elements, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, fnd is 1 if pairs_in_D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, _ is 1, nabors is greater than 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, in_aa is the last element in aa[m:], out_aa is the last element in aa[:n - m], and this is printed: fnd (where fnd is 1 if the total count of common elements is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0)

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and n - (n - m), k is an integer between 1 and m, aa is a list of strings of length n, bb is a list of strings of length m, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in aa[:m], cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, pairs_in_D is an integer representing the total count of common elements, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, fnd is 1 if pairs_in_D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, _ is 2, nabors is greater than 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, in_aa is the first element in aa[m:], out_aa is the first element in aa[:n - m], and this is printed: fnd which is 1 if pairs_in_D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
