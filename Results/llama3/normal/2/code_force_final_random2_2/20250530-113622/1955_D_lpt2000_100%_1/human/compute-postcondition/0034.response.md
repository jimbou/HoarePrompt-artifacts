Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and `n` and increased by 1, `k` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `aa` is a list of strings of length `n` and `n` is greater than `m`, `bb` is a list of strings of length `m`, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is an integer representing the total count of common elements, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0, `_` is 0, `nabors` is at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, in_aa is the third element in aa[m:], out_aa is the third element in aa[:n - m]. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, and the count of `out_aa` in `E` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is one less than its original value, `pairs_in_D` is one less than its original value, and `C[out_aa]` is one more than its original value. If `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then the count of `out_aa` in `E` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is one less than its original value, `pairs_in_D` is one less than its original value, and `C[out_aa]` is one more than its original value.***
