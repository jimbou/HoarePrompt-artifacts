Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and n, k is an integer between 1 and m, aa is a list of strings of length n and n is greater than m, bb is a list of strings of length m, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in aa[:m], cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, pairs_in_D is an integer representing the total count of common elements, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, fnd is 1 if pairs_in_D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, _ is 0, nabors is at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, in_aa is the last element in aa[m:], out_aa is the last element in aa[:n - m]. If C[in_aa] is greater than 0, then D[in_aa] is increased by 1, pairs_in_D is increased by 1, and C[in_aa] is decreased by 1. If C[in_aa] is not greater than 0, then E[in_aa] is incremented by 1. If D[out_aa] is greater than 0, then if E[out_aa] is greater than 0, E[out_aa] is decremented by 1. Otherwise, D[out_aa] is decreased by 1, pairs_in_D is decreased by 1, and C[out_aa] is increased by 1. If D[out_aa] is not greater than 0, then E[out_aa] is decremented by 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the following changes:

*   `in_aa` is the last element in `aa[m:]`.
*   `out_aa` is the last element in `aa[:n - m]`.
*   If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, then `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `C[in_aa]` is not greater than 0, then `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1.
*   If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then if `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1.

The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
