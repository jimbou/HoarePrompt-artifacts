Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and n-2, `k` is an integer between 1 and m, `aa` is a list of strings of length n, `bb` is a list of strings of length m, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in aa[:m], `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in bb, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, `pairs_in_D` is an integer representing the total count of common elements, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, where the count of `out_aa` is decreased by 1, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, `fnd` is 1 if pairs_in_D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, `_` is 2, `nabors` is greater than 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `in_aa` is the third last element in aa[m:], `out_aa` is the third last element in aa[:n - m]**.

In this output state, the value of `E[out_aa]` has been decreased by 1, indicating that the count of `out_aa` in `E` has been reduced by 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their original values and properties as specified in the initial state.
