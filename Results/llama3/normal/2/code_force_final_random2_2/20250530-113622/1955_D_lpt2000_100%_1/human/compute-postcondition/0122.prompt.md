Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and n, k is an integer between 1 and m, aa is a list of strings of length n, bb is a list of strings of length m, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in aa[:m], cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, pairs_in_D is an integer representing the total count of common elements, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, fnd is 1 if pairs_in_D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, _ is 2, nabors is greater than 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, in_aa is the last element in aa[m:], out_aa is the last element in aa[:n - m], and this is printed: fnd (where fnd is 1 if the total count of common elements is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0)
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            pairs_in_D -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        D[in_aa] += 1
        pairs_in_D += 1
        C[in_aa] -= 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and n-1, `k` is an integer between 1 and m, `aa` is a list of strings of length n, `bb` is a list of strings of length m, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in aa[:m], `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in bb, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, `pairs_in_D` is an integer representing the total count of common elements, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, `fnd` is 1 if pairs_in_D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, `_` is 2, `nabors` is greater than 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `in_aa` is the last element in aa[m:], `out_aa` is the last element in aa[:n - m]. If the count of out_aa in D is greater than 0, then if the value of E[out_aa] is greater than 0, the value of E[out_aa] is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the value of D[out_aa] is decremented by 1 and the value of C[out_aa] is incremented by 1. If the count of out_aa in D is 0, the value of E[out_aa] is decreased by 1. Additionally, if the count of in_aa in C is greater than 0, then D[in_aa] is incremented by 1, pairs_in_D is incremented by 1, and C[in_aa] is decremented by 1. If the count of in_aa in C is 0, then the value of E[in_aa] is incremented by 1, and fnd is incremented by 1 if pairs_in_D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise it remains the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and n-2, `k` is an integer between 1 and m, `aa` is a list of strings of length n, `bb` is a list of strings of length m, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in aa[:m], `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in bb, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, `pairs_in_D` is an integer representing the total count of common elements, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, `fnd` is 1 if pairs_in_D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, `_` is 2, `nabors` is greater than 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `in_aa` is the second last element in aa[m:], `out_aa` is the second last element in aa[:n - m]. If the count of out_aa in D is greater than 0, then the count of out_aa in E is decreased by 1 if it exists, otherwise the count of out_aa in D is decreased by 1, the count of pairs_in_D is decreased by 1, and the count of out_aa in C is increased by 1. If the count of out_aa in D is 0, then the count of out_aa in E is decreased by 1. If C[in_aa] > 0, then the count of in_aa in E is increased by 1, and `fnd` is increased by 1 if pairs_in_D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise it remains the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and n-2, `k` is an integer between 1 and m, `aa` is a list of strings of length n, `bb` is a list of strings of length m, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in aa[:m], `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in bb, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, `pairs_in_D` is an integer representing the total count of common elements, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, `fnd` is 1 if pairs_in_D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, `_` is 2, `nabors` is greater than 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `in_aa` is the third last element in aa[m:], `out_aa` is the third last element in aa[:n - m]. If out_aa is in D, the count of out_aa in D is decreased by 1. If out_aa is in E, the count of out_aa in E is decreased by 1. If out_aa is not in D and not in E, the count of out_aa in D is decreased by 1 and the count of out_aa in C is incremented by 1. If C[in_aa] > 0, then D[in_aa] is increased by 1, pairs_in_D is increased by 1, and C[in_aa] is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the count of in_aa in E is increased by 1. `fnd` is increased by 1 if pairs_in_D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise it remains the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
