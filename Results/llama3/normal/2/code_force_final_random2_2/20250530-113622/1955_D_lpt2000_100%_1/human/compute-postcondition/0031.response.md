Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and n and increased by 1, k is an integer between 1 and m, aa is a list of strings of length n and n is greater than m, bb is a list of strings of length m, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in aa[:m], cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, pairs_in_D is an integer representing the total count of common elements, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, fnd is 1 if pairs_in_D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, _ is 0, nabors is at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, in_aa is the third element in aa[m:], out_aa is the third element in aa[:n - m], D[out_aa] is one less than its original value, pairs_in_D is one less than its original value, C[out_aa] is one more than its original value.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The initial state remains the same, with `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`, `E`, `fnd`, `_`, and `nabors` retaining their original values. The only changes occur in the Counter objects `D` and `C`, and the integer `pairs_in_D`. The value of `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, and `pairs_in_D` is also decremented by 1. Additionally, the value of `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases, and `in_aa` and `out_aa` remain the third elements in `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]`, respectively.
