Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `k` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `aa` is a list of strings of length `n` that must have at least `n - m` elements, `bb` is a list of strings of length `m`, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is an integer representing the total count of common elements, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0, `_` is 1, `nabors` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `in_aa` is the first element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the first element in `aa[:n - m]`. If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, then `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then if `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is 0, `C[out_aa]` is greater than 0, and `pairs_in_D` is less than its original value by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is 0, then the count of `out_aa` in `E` is decreased by 1. Additionally, `C[in_aa]` is 0 and `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1. `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise it remains the same.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `fnd` is increased by 1 if the total count of common elements (`pairs_in_D`) is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise it remains the same.
