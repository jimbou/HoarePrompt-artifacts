This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the number of times a certain condition is met. For each test case, it reads three integers (n, m, k) and two lists of integers (aa and bb) of lengths n and m, respectively. It then calculates the common elements between the first m elements of aa and bb, and checks if the count of these common elements is greater than or equal to k. The function slides a window of size m over the list aa, updating the count of common elements and printing the number of times the condition is met.
