Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `k` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `aa` is a list of strings of length `n` and `n` is greater than `m`, `bb` is a list of strings of length `m`, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is an integer representing the total count of common elements, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0, `_` is 0, `nabors` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `in_aa` is the first element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the first element in `aa[:n - m]`, the current value of `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, and the current value of `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `E[out_aa]` has been decremented by 1, but all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `E[out_aa]` is now greater than 0 but has been reduced by 1.
