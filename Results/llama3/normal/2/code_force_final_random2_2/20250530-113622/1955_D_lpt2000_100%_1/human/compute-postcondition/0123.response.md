Based on the precondition, the value of `fnd` is determined by the comparison between `pairs_in_D` and `k`. If `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `fnd` is 1, otherwise it is 0.

Since `pairs_in_D` represents the total count of common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, and `k` is an integer between 1 and `m`, the value of `fnd` depends on the number of common elements between the first `m` elements of `aa` and all elements of `bb`.

Output: **1 if the number of common elements between the first m elements of aa and all elements of bb is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0**
