Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and n, k is an integer between 1 and m, aa is a list of strings of length n and n is greater than m, bb is a list of strings of length m, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in aa[:m], cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, pairs_in_D is an integer representing the total count of common elements, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, fnd is 1 if pairs_in_D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, _ is 0, nabors is at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, in_aa is the first element in aa[m:], out_aa is the first element in aa[:n - m]. The frequency of in_aa in D is increased by 1, pairs_in_D is increased by 1, and the frequency of in_aa in C is decreased by 1.**
