Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `k` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `aa` is a list of strings of length `n` and `n` is greater than `m`, `bb` is a list of strings of length `m`, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is an integer representing the total count of common elements, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0, `_` is 0, `nabors` is at least 1, stdin contains `t-2` test cases, `in_aa` is the second element in `aa[m:]`. If `E[out_aa] > 0`, then the count of `out_aa` in `E` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the count of `out_aa` in `D` is decreased by 1, the total count of common elements `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, and the count of `out_aa` in `C` is increased by 1.***
