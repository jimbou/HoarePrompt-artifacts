The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `nabors`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nabors`. If `nabors` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `nabors` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) does ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `nabors` is at least 1 and `_` is now 0. 
State: **`nabors` is at least 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two lists of integers a and b of lengths n and m respectively, where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^6**
