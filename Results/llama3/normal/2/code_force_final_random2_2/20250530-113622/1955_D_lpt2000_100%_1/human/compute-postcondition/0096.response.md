Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and n-1, k is an integer between 1 and m, aa is a list of strings of length n, bb is a list of strings of length m, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in aa[:m], cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, pairs_in_D is an integer representing the total count of common elements, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, fnd is 1 if pairs_in_D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, _ is 2, nabors is greater than 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, in_aa is the last element in aa[m:], out_aa is the last element in aa[:n - m]. If the count of out_aa in D is greater than 0, then if the value of E[out_aa] is greater than 0, the value of E[out_aa] is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the value of D[out_aa] is decremented by 1 and the value of C[out_aa] is incremented by 1. If the count of out_aa in D is 0, the value of E[out_aa] is decreased by 1. The current value of C[in_aa] is greater than 0.***
