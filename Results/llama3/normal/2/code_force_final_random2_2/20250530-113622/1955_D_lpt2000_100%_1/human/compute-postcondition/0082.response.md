The code prints the value of `fnd`, which is an integer indicating whether the total count of common elements (`pairs_in_D`) is greater than or equal to `k`.

Since `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, and 0 otherwise, the output will be either 1 or 0.

Output: **1 if the total count of common elements is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0**
