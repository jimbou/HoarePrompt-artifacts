Output State: **`nabors` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two lists of integers a and b of lengths n and m respectively, where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^6.**

In natural language, the output state is that the variable `nabors` has been assigned an integer value between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), which is the first input from the standard input. The remaining standard input contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, m, and k, followed by two lists of integers a and b. The values of n, m, k, a, and b are constrained as specified in the initial state.
