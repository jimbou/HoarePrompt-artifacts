Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer t, then an integer n, then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, then an integer m, and finally m pairs of integers x_i and y_i. The integers t, n, and m are positive. The list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n is a strictly increasing list of non-negative integers. The pairs of integers x_i and y_i are such that 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n and x_i != y_i.**
