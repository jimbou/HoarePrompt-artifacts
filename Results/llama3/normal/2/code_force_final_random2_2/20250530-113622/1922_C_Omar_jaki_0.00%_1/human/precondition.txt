stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer t, then an integer n, then a list of n unique integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, and finally an integer m followed by m pairs of integers x_i and y_i. The integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are in ascending order, and for each city i, the closest city j is unique. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
