Output State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, a is a list of at least 4 floats where the first element is -1000000000.0, the next n elements are the input list of n integers and n is at least 2, and the last element is 2000000000.0, b is a list of four elements where the first two elements are zeros, the third element is the second zero plus v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than x - w, and the fourth element is the second zero plus v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than z - y, w is -1000000000.0, x is the first integer in the input list, y is the second integer in the input list, z is the third integer in the input list, and v is y - x.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `a` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `b` is modified by the code, with its last two elements being updated based on the values of `v`, `x`, `w`, `y`, and `z`. The values of `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The variable `v` is assigned the value of `y - x`.
