Output State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, a is a list of at least 4 floats where the first element is -1000000000.0, the next n elements are the input list of n integers, and the last element is 2000000000.0, b is a list of six elements where the first two elements are zeros, the third element is the second zero plus v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than x - w, the fourth element is the second zero plus v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than z - y, the fifth element is the third element plus v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than x - w, and the sixth element is the fourth element plus v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than z - y, w is the first integer in the input list, x is the second integer in the input list, y is the third integer in the input list, z is the fourth integer in the input list (if it exists), and v is y - x.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `a` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `b` is modified by the code, with two new elements added to the end. The third element of `b` is the second zero plus `v` raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether `v` is greater than `x - w`. The fourth element of `b` is the second zero plus `v` raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether `v` is greater than `z - y`. The fifth element of `b` is the third element plus `v` raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether `v` is greater than `x - w`. The sixth element of `b` is the fourth element plus `v` raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether `v` is greater than `z - y`. The values of `w`, `x`, `y`, `z`, and `v` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
