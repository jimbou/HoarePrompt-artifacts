Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, a is a list of n+2 floats where the first element is -1000000000.0, the next n elements are the input list of n integers, and the last element is 2000000000.0, b is a list of two zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases with three inputs: an integer n, a list of n integers, and an integer m, and finally m pairs of integers x_i and y_i.
Code of the loop:
for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    v = y - x
    b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, a is a list of at least 4 floats where the first element is -1000000000.0, the next n elements are the input list of n integers and n is at least 2, and the last element is 2000000000.0, b is a list of four elements where the first two elements are zeros, the third element is the second zero plus v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than x - w, and the fourth element is the second zero plus v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than z - y, w is -1000000000.0, x is the first integer in the input list, y is the second integer in the input list, z is the third integer in the input list, and v is y - x.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, a is a list of at least 4 floats where the first element is -1000000000.0, the next n elements are the input list of n integers, and the last element is 2000000000.0, b is a list of six elements where the first two elements are zeros, the third element is the second zero plus v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than x - w, the fourth element is the second zero plus v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than z - y, the fifth element is the third element plus v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than x - w, and the sixth element is the fourth element plus v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than z - y, w is the first integer in the input list, x is the second integer in the input list, y is the third integer in the input list, z is the fourth integer in the input list (if it exists), and v is y - x.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, a is a list of at least 3 floats where the first element is -1000000000.0, the next n elements are the input list of n integers, and the last element is 2000000000.0, b is a list of eight elements where the first two elements are zeros, the third element is the second zero plus v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than x - w, the fourth element is the second zero plus v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than z - y, the fifth element is the third element plus v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than x - w, the sixth element is the fourth element plus v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than z - y, the seventh element is the sixth element plus v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than x - w, and the eighth element is the seventh element plus v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than z - y, w is the second integer in the input list, x is the third integer in the input list, y is the fourth integer in the input list (if it exists), z is the fifth integer in the input list (if it exists), and v is y - x




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
