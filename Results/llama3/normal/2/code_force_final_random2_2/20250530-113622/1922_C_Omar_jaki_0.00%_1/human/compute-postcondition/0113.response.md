Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer t, an integer n, a list of n integers, an integer m, and m pairs of integers. It calculates a list b based on the differences between consecutive elements in the list of integers, and then prints the differences between specific elements in b for each pair of integers. The function repeats this process until all test cases have been processed.**
