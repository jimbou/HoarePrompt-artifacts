#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer t, then an integer n, then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, then an integer m, and finally m pairs of integers x_i and y_i. The integers t, n, and m are positive. The list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n is a strictly increasing list of non-negative integers. The pairs of integers x_i and y_i are such that 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n and x_i != y_i.
    r = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = r()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        r()
        
        a = -1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0
        
        b = [0, 0]
        
        for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
            v = y - x
            b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
        
        print(b, 'B')
        
        u, = r()
        
        while u:
            u -= 1
            c, d = r()
            if c < d:
                print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
            else:
                print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
        
    #State: Output State: t is 0, a is a list of at least 4 floats where the first element is -1000000000.0, the next n elements are the input list of n integers, and the last element is 2000000000.0, b is a list of 2n+2n+2n-2 elements where the first two elements are zeros, the next 2n elements are calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in a, and the last 2n+2n-2 elements are calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in a and the last two elements are b[-2] + v and b[-1] + v, w is the (n-1)th element of a, x is the nth element of a, y is 2000000000.0, z is not defined, v is y - x, u is 0, c and d are the return values of the function r(), and the difference between the (2*(d-1))th and (2*(c-1))th elements of b is printed if c is less than d, otherwise the difference between the (2*c-1)th and (2*d-1)th elements of b is printed.
    #
    #In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times, with the only difference being that t is now 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer t, an integer n, a list of n integers, an integer m, and m pairs of integers. It calculates a list b based on the differences between consecutive elements in the list of integers, and then prints the differences between specific elements in b for each pair of integers. The function repeats this process until all test cases have been processed.
