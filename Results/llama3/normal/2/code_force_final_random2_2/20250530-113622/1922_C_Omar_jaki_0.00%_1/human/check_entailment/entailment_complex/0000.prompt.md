Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer t, then an integer n, then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, then an integer m, and finally m pairs of integers x_i and y_i. The integers t, n, and m are positive. The list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n is a strictly increasing list of non-negative integers. The pairs of integers x_i and y_i are such that 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n and x_i != y_i.
    r = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = r()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        r()
        
        a = -1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0
        
        b = [0, 0]
        
        for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
            v = y - x
            b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
        
        print(b, 'B')
        
        u, = r()
        
        while u:
            u -= 1
            c, d = r()
            if c < d:
                print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
            else:
                print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
        
    #State: Output State: t is 0, a is a list of at least 4 floats where the first element is -1000000000.0, the next n elements are the input list of n integers, and the last element is 2000000000.0, b is a list of 2n+2n+2n-2 elements where the first two elements are zeros, the next 2n elements are calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in a, and the last 2n+2n-2 elements are calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in a and the last two elements are b[-2] + v and b[-1] + v, w is the (n-1)th element of a, x is the nth element of a, y is 2000000000.0, z is not defined, v is y - x, u is 0, c and d are the return values of the function r(), and the difference between the (2*(d-1))th and (2*(c-1))th elements of b is printed if c is less than d, otherwise the difference between the (2*c-1)th and (2*d-1)th elements of b is printed.
    #
    #In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times, with the only difference being that t is now 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer t, an integer n, a list of n integers, an integer m, and m pairs of integers. It calculates a list b based on the differences between consecutive elements in the list of integers, and then prints the differences between specific elements in b for each pair of integers. The function repeats this process until all test cases have been processed.
