Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, a is a list of at least 3 floats where the first element is -1000000000.0, the next n elements are the input list of n integers, and the last element is 2000000000.0, b is a list of 2n+2 elements where the first two elements are zeros, and the rest of the elements are calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in a, w is the (n-1)th integer in the input list, x is the nth integer in the input list, y is 2000000000.0, z is not defined, v is y - x, u is the first element of the list returned by function r(), and the list b and the string 'B' are printed.
Code of the loop:
while u:
    u -= 1
    c, d = r()
    if c < d:
        print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
    else:
        print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2, a is a list of at least 3 floats where the first element is -1000000000.0, the next n elements are the input list of n integers, and the last element is 2000000000.0, b is a list of 2n+2 elements where the first two elements are zeros, and the rest of the elements are calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in a, w is the (n-1)th integer in the input list, x is the nth integer in the input list, y is 2000000000.0, z is not defined, v is y - x, u is a truthy value equal to its original value minus 1, c and d are the return values of the function r(). If c < d, the difference between the (2d-2)th and (2c-2)th elements of the list b is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th and (2*d - 1)th elements of the list b is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3, a is a list of at least 3 floats where the first element is -1000000000.0, the next n elements are the input list of n integers, and the last element is 2000000000.0, b is a list of 2n+2 elements where the first two elements are zeros, and the rest of the elements are calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in a, w is the (n-1)th integer in the input list, x is the nth integer in the input list, y is 2000000000.0, z is not defined, v is y - x, u is falsy, c and d are the return values of the function r(), and the difference between either the (2*(d-1))th and (2*(c-1))th elements of list b or the (2*c-1)th and (2*d-1)th elements of b is being printed, depending on whether c is less than d or not.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3, a is a list of at least 3 floats where the first element is -1000000000.0, the next n elements are the input list of n integers, and the last element is 2000000000.0, b is a list of 2n+2 elements where the first two elements are zeros, and the rest of the elements are calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in a, w is the (n-1)th integer in the input list, x is the nth integer in the input list, y is 2000000000.0, z is not defined, v is y - x, u is falsy, c and d are the return values of the function r(), and the difference between either the (2*(d-1))th and (2*(c-1))th elements of list b or the (2*c-1)th and (2*d-1)th elements of b is being printed, depending on whether c is less than d or not.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
