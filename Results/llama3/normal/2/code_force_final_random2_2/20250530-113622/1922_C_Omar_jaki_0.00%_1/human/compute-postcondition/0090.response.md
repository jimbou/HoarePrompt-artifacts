Output: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus n-1 and t must be greater than 0, a is a list of at least 4 floats where the first element is -1000000000.0, the next n elements are the input list of n integers, and the last element is 2000000000.0, b is a list of 2n+2n+2n-2 elements where the first two elements are zeros, the next 2n elements are calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in a, and the last 2n+2n-2 elements are calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in a and the last two elements are b[-2] + v and b[-1] + v, w is the (n-1)th element of a, x is the nth element of a, y is 2000000000.0, z is not defined, v is y - x, u is the return value of the function r() minus two and must be truthy, c and d are the return values of the function r(), and the current value of c is less than the current value of d, and the difference between the (2*(d-1))th element of b and the (2*(c-1))th element of b is being printed**
