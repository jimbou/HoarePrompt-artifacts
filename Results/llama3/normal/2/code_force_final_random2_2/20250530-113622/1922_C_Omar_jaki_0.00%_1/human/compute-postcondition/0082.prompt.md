Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus one and t must be greater than 1, a is a list of at least 4 floats where the first element is -1000000000.0, the next n elements are the input list of n integers, and the last element is 2000000000.0, b is a list of 2n+2n elements where the first two elements are zeros, the next 2n elements are calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in a, and the last 2n elements are calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in a, v is the difference between y and x, x is the nth integer in the input list, y is 2000000000.0, z is not defined, w is the (n-1)th integer in the input list, u is falsy and is the return value of the function r() minus one, c and d are the return values of the function r(), list b and the string 'B' are being printed, and the difference between either the (2*c-1)th and (2*d-1)th elements of list b or the (2*d-1)th and (2*c-1)th elements of list b is being printed, depending on whether c is less than d or not. Additionally, if c is less than d, the difference between the (d-1)*2th and (c-1)*2th elements of list b is being printed, otherwise the difference between the (2*c-1)th and (2*d-1)th elements of list b is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    v = y - x
    b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus one and t must be greater than 1, a is a list of at least 4 floats where the first element is -1000000000.0, the next n elements are the input list of n integers, and the last element is 2000000000.0, b is a list of 2n+2n+2 elements where the first two elements are zeros, the next 2n elements are calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in a, and the last 2n+2 elements are calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in a and the last two elements are b[-2] + v

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus two and t must be greater than 0, a is a list of at least 4 floats where the first element is -1000000000.0, the next n elements are the input list of n integers, and the last element is 2000000000.0, b is a list of 2n+2n+4 elements where the first two elements are zeros, the next 2n elements are calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in a, and the last 2n+4 elements are calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in a and the last two elements are b[-2] + v and b[-1] + v, w is the second element of a, x is the third element of a, y is the fourth element of a, z is the fifth element of a, v is y - x

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus two and t must be greater than 0, a is a list of at least 5 floats where the first element is -1000000000.0, the next n elements are the input list of n integers, and the last element is 2000000000.0, b is a list of 2n+2n+6 elements where the first two elements are zeros, the next 2n elements are calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in a, and the last 2n+6 elements are calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in a and the last two elements are b[-2] + v and b[-1] + v, w is the third element of a, x is the fourth element of a, y is the fifth element of a, z is the sixth element of a, v is y - x.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
