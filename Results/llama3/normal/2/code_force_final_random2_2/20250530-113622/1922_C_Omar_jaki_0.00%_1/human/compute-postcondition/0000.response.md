Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: an integer n, a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, and an integer m, and finally m pairs of integers x_i and y_i. The integer n and m are positive. The list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n is a strictly increasing list of non-negative integers. The pairs of integers x_i and y_i are such that 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n and x_i != y_i. t is a positive integer.**

Explanation: The code reads the first input from stdin, which is an integer t, and assigns it to the variable t. This line does not affect any other variables or the state of stdin. The remaining inputs in stdin are still present and unchanged. The value of t is now a positive integer.
