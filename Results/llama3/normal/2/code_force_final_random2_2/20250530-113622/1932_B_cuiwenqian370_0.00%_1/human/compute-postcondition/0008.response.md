According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. If `results` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `results` is a list containing `t` elements which are the return value of `func_1(path)` where `path` is `data[2i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, `t` + 1). So for the loop to be executed, `results` must have at least 1 element, and `result` is the first element in the list.

State: **`data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, and for every `i` > 0, `data[i]` is either a positive integer or a string that can be converted to a list of positive integers, `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, `index` is `2t` + 1, `results` is a list containing at least 1 element which are the return value of `func_1(path)` where `path` is `data[2i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, `t` + 1), `result` is the first element in the list, `stdin` is empty**
