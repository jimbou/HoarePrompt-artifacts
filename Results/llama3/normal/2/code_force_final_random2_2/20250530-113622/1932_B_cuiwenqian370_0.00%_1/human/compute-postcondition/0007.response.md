Output State: **data is a list of strings where data[0] is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, and for every i > 0, data[i] is either a positive integer or a string that can be converted to a list of positive integers, t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, index is 2t + 1, results is a list containing t elements which are the return value of func_1(path) where path is data[2i - 1] for i in range(1, t + 1), stdin is empty**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `data` remains unchanged, the variable `t` is still a positive integer but may be 0 if the loop didn't execute at all, the `index` variable is now `2t + 1` because it increments by 2 in each iteration, the `results` list contains `t` elements which are the return values of `func_1` applied to the paths at odd indices in `data`, and `stdin` remains empty.
