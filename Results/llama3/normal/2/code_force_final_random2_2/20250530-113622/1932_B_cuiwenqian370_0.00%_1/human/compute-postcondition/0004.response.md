Output State: **data is a list of strings where data[0] is a positive integer greater than 0, and for every i > 0, data[i] is either a positive integer or a string that can be converted to a list of positive integers, t is a positive integer greater than 1, index is 5, results is a list containing two elements which are the return value of func_1(path) where path is data[1] and data[4], n is a positive integer equal to data[3], stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `n` is now a positive integer equal to `data[3]`, which was previously unspecified. The value of `index` has been incremented twice, resulting in a new value of 5. The `results` list now contains two elements: the original return value of `func_1(path)` where `path` is `data[1]`, and the new return value of `func_1(path)` where `path` is `data[4]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
