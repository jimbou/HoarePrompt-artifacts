The code prints the value of `result` which is the first element in the list `results`. The list `results` contains the return values of `func_1(path)` where `path` is `data[2i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, `t` + 1). Since the exact return values of `func_1(path)` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `result`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the first return value of `func_1(path)` for the given paths.

Output: **the first return value of func_1(path) for the given paths (where path is data[2i - 1] for i in range(1, t + 1))**
