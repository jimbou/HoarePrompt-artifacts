Output State: **data is a list of strings where data[0] is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, and for every i > 0, data[i] is either a positive integer or a string that can be converted to a list of positive integers, t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, index is 2t + 1, results is a list containing t elements which are the return value of func_1(path) where path is data[2i - 1] for i in range(1, t + 1), stdin is empty, and all elements of the results list which are the return value of func_1(path) where path is data[2i - 1] for i in range(1, t + 1) have been printed**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that all elements of the results list, which are the return values of func_1(path) for each path in data, have been printed. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
