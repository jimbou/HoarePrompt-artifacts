State: **`path` is a list of characters, where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is at least 4, `dp` is a list of `n` values, and `i` is 4. If `path[i]` is '*', then `dp[4]` is -float('inf'). Otherwise, `dp[4]` is the maximum of `dp[3]` and `dp[2]` plus 1 if `path[4]` is '@' or 0 if `path[4]` is '*'.**
