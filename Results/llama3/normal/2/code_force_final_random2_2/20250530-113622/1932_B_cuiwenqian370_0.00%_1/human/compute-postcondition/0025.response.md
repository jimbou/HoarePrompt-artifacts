To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `n` is already at least 3, it remains the same.

The other variables, `path` and `dp`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`path` is a list of characters, where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of `n` values, and `i` is 3**
