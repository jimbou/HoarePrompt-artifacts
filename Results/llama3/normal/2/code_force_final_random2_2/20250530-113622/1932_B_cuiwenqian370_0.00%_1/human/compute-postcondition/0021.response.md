Output State: **`path` is a list of characters, where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of `n` values where `dp[2]` is -float('inf'), and `i` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `dp[i]` has been updated to -float('inf') because `i` is 2 and `path[i]` is '*'. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `path` still contains characters '@' or '*', `n` is still at least 3, and `i` is still 2.
