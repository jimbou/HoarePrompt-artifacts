Reasoning: 

The given program does not match the problem description. The problem description asks to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, given the periodicities of the signs. However, the provided program appears to be solving a different problem, which involves finding the maximum number of consecutive '@' characters in a list that can be reached by moving either one or two steps at a time.

The program does not take into account the periodicities of the signs, nor does it calculate the year in which the n-th sign will occur. Therefore, the program is not correct for the given problem description.

Correctness: **False**
