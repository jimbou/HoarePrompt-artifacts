Output State: **`path` is a list of characters, where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is at least 4, `dp` is a list of `n` values, `i` is 4, `dp[4]` is the maximum of `dp[3]` and `dp[2]` plus 1 if `path[4]` is '@' or 0 if `path[4]` is '*', and `dp[5]` is the maximum of `dp[4]` and `dp[3]` plus 1 if `path[5]` is '@' or 0 if `path[5]` is '*'.**

In this output state, the value of `dp[5]` is calculated based on the values of `dp[4]` and `dp[3]`, and the character at index 5 in the `path` list. If `path[5]` is '@', then `dp[5]` is the maximum of `dp[4]` and `dp[3]` plus 1. If `path[5]` is '*', then `dp[5]` is the maximum of `dp[4]` and `dp[3]`. The values of `n`, `path`, and `i` remain unchanged.
