The code prints the third element in the `results` list which is the return value of `func_1(path)` where `path` is `data[2i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, `t` + 1).
Output: **the third element in the results list (which is the return value of func_1(path) where path is data[2i - 1] for i in range(1, t + 1))**
