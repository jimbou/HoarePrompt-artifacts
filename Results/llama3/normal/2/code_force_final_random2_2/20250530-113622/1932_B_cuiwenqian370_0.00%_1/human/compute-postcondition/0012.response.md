The `print(result)` statement will print the second element in the `results` list. 

The `results` list contains the return values of `func_1(path)` where `path` is `data[2i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, `t` + 1). 

Since the exact return values of `func_1(path)` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `result`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the second element in the `results` list.

Output: **the second element in the results list (which is the return value of func_1(path) where path is data[2i - 1] for i in range(1, t + 1))**
