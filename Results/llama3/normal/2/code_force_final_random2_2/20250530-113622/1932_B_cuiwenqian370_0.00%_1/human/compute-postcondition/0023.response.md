Output State: **`path` is a list of characters, where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of `n` values, `i` is 2, `dp[i]` is `max(dp[1], dp[0]) + 1`, and the character at index `i` in `path` is '@'**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of characters `path` remains unchanged, with each character being either '@' or '*'. The value of `n` is still at least 3. The list `dp` has been updated, where the value at index `i` (which is 2) is now the maximum of the values at indices 1 and 0, plus 1. The value of `i` is still 2, and the character at index `i` in `path` is still '@'.
