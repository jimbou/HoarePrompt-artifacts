Output State: **`path` is a list of characters, where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of `n` values, `i` is 3, and `dp[3]` is the maximum of `dp[2]` and `dp[1]` plus 1 if `path[3]` is '@' or 0 if `path[3]` is '*'.**

In this output state, the value of `dp[3]` has been updated based on the values of `dp[2]`, `dp[1]`, and `path[3]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `dp[3]` is now a combination of the maximum of `dp[2]` and `dp[1]` and a conditional value based on `path[3]`.
