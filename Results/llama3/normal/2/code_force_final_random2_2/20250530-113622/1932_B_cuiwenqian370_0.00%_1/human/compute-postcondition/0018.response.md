Functionality: **This function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It expects the input to be a list of strings where the first string is a positive integer, and the remaining strings are either positive integers or strings that can be converted to lists of positive integers. The function processes the input in pairs, where each pair consists of a positive integer and a string. It calls another function, func_1, with the string as an argument and appends the result to a list. After processing all pairs, it prints the results. The function does not return any value, and its purpose is to process and print the results of the input data.**
