Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks to find the year in which all n signs will occur, but the program does not correctly calculate this year.

The program uses a dynamic programming approach to find the maximum value in the dp array, but this approach is not relevant to the problem description. The problem description requires finding the year in which all n signs will occur, not the maximum value in an array.

A correct solution would involve iterating through the array of sign periodicities and calculating the year in which each sign will occur, taking into account the fact that each sign must occur after the previous one. The program does not do this.

For example, if the input is [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18], the program will not correctly calculate the year in which all 6 signs will occur. The correct solution would be to calculate the year in which each sign will occur, starting from the first sign, and then find the maximum year among all signs.
