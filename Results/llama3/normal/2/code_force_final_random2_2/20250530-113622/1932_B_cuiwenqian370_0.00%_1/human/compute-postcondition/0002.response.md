Output State: **data is a list of strings where data[0] is a positive integer greater than 0, and for every i > 0, data[i] is either a positive integer or a string that can be converted to a list of positive integers, t is a positive integer greater than 0, index is 3, results is a list containing one element which is the return value of func_1(path) where path is data[1], stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `data` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code. The value of `t` also remains unchanged as it was not used or modified by the code. The value of `index` was incremented twice, so it becomes 3. The value of `results` is now a list containing one element, which is the return value of `func_1(path)`, where `path` is `data[1]`. The value of `stdin` remains empty as it was not used or modified by the code.
