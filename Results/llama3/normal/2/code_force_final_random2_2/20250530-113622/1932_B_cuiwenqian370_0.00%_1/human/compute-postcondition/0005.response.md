To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means we can only adjust the state of `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decreased by 1.

State: **data is a list of strings where data[0] is a positive integer greater than 0, and for every i > 0, data[i] is either a positive integer or a string that can be converted to a list of positive integers, t is a positive integer greater than 0, index is 5, results is a list containing two elements which are the return value of func_1(path) where path is data[1] and data[4], n is a positive integer equal to data[3], stdin is empty**
