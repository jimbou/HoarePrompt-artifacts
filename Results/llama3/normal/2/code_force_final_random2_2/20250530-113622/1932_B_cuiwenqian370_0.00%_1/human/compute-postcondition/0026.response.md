Output State: **`path` is a list of characters, where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of `n` values where `dp[3]` is -float('inf'), and `i` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `dp[i]` has been updated to `-float('inf')`, which is a very large negative number, since `i` is 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `path` still contains characters '@' or '*', `n` is still at least 3, and `i` is still 3.
