Output State: **data is a list of strings where data[0] is a positive integer greater than 0, and for every i > 0, data[i] is either a positive integer or a string that can be converted to a list of positive integers, t is a positive integer greater than 0, index is 7, results is a list containing three elements which are the return value of func_1(path) where path is data[1], data[4], and data[6], n is a positive integer equal to data[5], stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the positive integer value stored in `data[5]`. The `index` variable has been incremented twice, resulting in a final value of 7. The `results` list has been appended with the return value of `func_1(path)` where `path` is `data[6]`, adding a third element to the list. All other variables and conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
