Reasoning:
The provided functions do not match the problem description. The problem requires determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, based on the periodicities of the signs. However, the provided functions seem to be related to a different problem, involving dynamic programming and string processing.

Function 1 appears to calculate the maximum number of consecutive '@' characters that can be reached by moving either one or two steps at a time, starting from the beginning of the input list `path`. Function 2 reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results, but it does not seem to be related to the problem of determining the year of the apocalypse.

Since the provided functions do not match the problem description, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
