Output State: **`path` is a list of characters, where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is at least 4, `dp` is a list of `n` values, `i` is 4, and `dp[4]` is -float('inf').**

In this output state, the value of `dp[i]` has been updated to -float('inf'), which means that the maximum value that `dp[4]` can hold is now negative infinity. The other variables remain unchanged, with `path` still being a list of characters, `n` being at least 4, and `i` being 4.
