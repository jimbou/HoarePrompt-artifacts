Reasoning:

The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem description asks to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, given the periodicities of the signs. However, the provided program seems to be solving a different problem, which involves finding the maximum number of '@' characters in a path that can be reached without encountering a '*' character.

The program defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes a path as input and returns the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached without encountering a '*' character. `func_2` reads input from the standard input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results.

However, the problem description does not mention anything about '@' and '*' characters, or finding the maximum number of '@' characters in a path. Instead, it asks to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, given the periodicities of the signs.

Therefore, the provided program does not solve the problem described in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
