The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If n is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is larger than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 3 and i is now 2. 
State: **`path` is a list of characters, where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of `n` values, `i` is 2**
