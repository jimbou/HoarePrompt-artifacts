Output State: **The program returns the maximum value in the list `dp` that is greater than negative infinity. This value represents the maximum number of consecutive '@' characters in the list `path` that can be reached by moving either one or two steps at a time, starting from the beginning of the list. The value is calculated based on the values of `dp` which are determined by the characters in `path` and the rules specified in the initial state.**
