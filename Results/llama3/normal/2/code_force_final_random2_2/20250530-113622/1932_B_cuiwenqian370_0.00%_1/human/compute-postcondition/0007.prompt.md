Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: data is a list of strings where data[0] is a positive integer, and for every i > 0, data[i] is either a positive integer or a string that can be converted to a list of positive integers, t is a positive integer equal to data[0], index is 1, results is an empty list, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    path = data[index]
    index += 1
    results.append(func_1(path))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: data is a list of strings where data[0] is a positive integer greater than 0, and for every i > 0, data[i] is either a positive integer or a string that can be converted to a list of positive integers, t is a positive integer greater than 0, index is 3, results is a list containing one element which is the return value of func_1(path) where path is data[1], stdin is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: data is a list of strings where data[0] is a positive integer greater than 0, and for every i > 0, data[i] is either a positive integer or a string that can be converted to a list of positive integers, t is a positive integer greater than 1, index is 5, results is a list containing two elements which are the return value of func_1(path) where path is data[1] and data[4], n is a positive integer equal to data[3], stdin is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: data is a list of strings where data[0] is a positive integer greater than 0, and for every i > 0, data[i] is either a positive integer or a string that can be converted to a list of positive integers, t is a positive integer greater than 0, index is 7, results is a list containing three elements which are the return value of func_1(path) where path is data[1], data[4], and data[6], n is a positive integer equal to data[5], stdin is empty




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
