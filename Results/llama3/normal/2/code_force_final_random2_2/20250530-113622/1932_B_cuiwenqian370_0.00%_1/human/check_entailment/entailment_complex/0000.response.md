Reasoning: 

The provided code does not match the problem description. The problem description asks to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, given the periodicities of the signs. However, the provided code seems to be solving a different problem, which is to calculate the maximum number of consecutive '@' characters that can be reached by moving either one or two steps at a time, starting from the beginning of the input list `path`.

The code provided does not take into account the periodicities of the signs, nor does it calculate the year in which the n-th sign will occur. Therefore, it does not meet the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
