Postcondition: ***`path` is a list of characters, where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of `n` values, and `i` is 3. If `path[i]` is '*', then `dp[3]` is -float('inf'). Otherwise, `dp[3]` is the maximum of `dp[2]` and `dp[1]` plus 1 if `path[3]` is '@' or 0 if `path[3]` is '*'.***
