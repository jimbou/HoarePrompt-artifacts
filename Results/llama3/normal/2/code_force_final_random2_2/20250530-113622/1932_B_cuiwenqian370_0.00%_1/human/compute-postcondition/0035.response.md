Functionality: **This function calculates the maximum number of consecutive '@' characters that can be reached by moving either one or two steps at a time, starting from the beginning of the input list `path`. If the input list is empty, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it iterates through the list, updating a dynamic programming table `dp` based on the characters in `path`. If a character is '*', the corresponding value in `dp` is set to negative infinity. If a character is '@', the corresponding value in `dp` is set to the maximum of the previous two values in `dp` plus 1. The function finally returns the maximum value in `dp` that is greater than negative infinity, representing the maximum number of consecutive '@' characters that can be reached.**
