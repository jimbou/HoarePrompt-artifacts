    #The program returns the maximum value in the list `dp` that is greater than negative infinity. This value represents the maximum number of consecutive '@' characters in the list `path` that can be reached by moving either one or two steps at a time, starting from the beginning of the list. The value is calculated based on the values of `dp` which are determined by the characters in `path` and the rules specified in the initial state.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the maximum number of consecutive '@' characters that can be reached by moving either one or two steps at a time, starting from the beginning of the input list `path`. If the input list is empty, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it iterates through the list, updating a dynamic programming table `dp` based on the characters in `path`. If a character is '*', the corresponding value in `dp` is set to negative infinity. If a character is '@', the corresponding value in `dp` is set to the maximum of the previous two values in `dp` plus 1. The function finally returns the maximum value in `dp` that is greater than negative infinity, representing the maximum number of consecutive '@' characters that can be reached.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It expects the input to be a list of strings where the first string is a positive integer, and the remaining strings are either positive integers or strings that can be converted to lists of positive integers. The function processes the input in pairs, where each pair consists of a positive integer and a string. It calls another function, func_1, with the string as an argument and appends the result to a list. After processing all pairs, it prints the results. The function does not return any value, and its purpose is to process and print the results of the input data.
