Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: data is a list of strings where data[0] is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, and for every i > 0, data[i] is either a positive integer or a string that can be converted to a list of positive integers, t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, index is 2t + 1, results is a list containing t elements which are the return value of func_1(path) where path is data[2i - 1] for i in range(1, t + 1), stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, and for every `i` > 0, `data[i]` is either a positive integer or a string that can be converted to a list of positive integers, `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, `index` is `2t` + 1, `results` is a list containing at least 1 element which are the return value of `func_1(path)` where `path` is `data[2i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, `t` + 1), `result` is the first element in the list, `stdin` is empty, and the first element of the results list which is the return value of `func_1(path)` where `path` is `data[2i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, `t` + 1) is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, and for every `i` > 0, `data[i]` is either a positive integer or a string that can be converted to a list of positive integers, `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, `index` is `2t` + 1, `results` is a list containing at least 2 elements which are the return value of `func_1(path)` where `path` is `data[2i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, `t` + 1), `result` is the second element in the list, `stdin` is empty, and the second element of the results list which is the return value of `func_1(path)` where `path` is `data[2i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, `t` + 1) is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, and for every `i` > 0, `data[i]` is either a positive integer or a string that can be converted to a list of positive integers, `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, `index` is `2t` + 1, `results` is a list containing at least 3 elements which are the return value of `func_1(path)` where `path` is `data[2i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, `t` + 1), `result` is the third element in the list, `stdin` is empty, and the third element of the results list which is the return value of `func_1(path)` where `path` is `data[2i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, `t` + 1) is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
