Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`path` is a list of characters, where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the number of characters in `path`, `n` is larger than 0, and `dp` is a list of `n` values. If `n` is 1, the values of `dp` are not changed. If `n` is larger than 1, the first element of `dp` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', otherwise it is -inf. If the second character of `path` is '*', the second value of `dp` is -inf and the rest are zeros. If the second character of `path` is '@', the second element of `dp` is 2 if the first character of `path` is '@' else it is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(2, n):
    if path[i] == '*':
        dp[i] = -float('inf')
    else:
        dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`path` is a list of characters, where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of `n` values, and `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` in `path` is '*', `dp[2]` is -float('inf'). Otherwise, `dp[i]` is `max(dp[1], dp[0]) + 1`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`path` is a list of characters, where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of `n` values, and `i` is 3. If `path[i]` is '*', then `dp[3]` is -float('inf'). Otherwise, `dp[3]` is the maximum of `dp[2]` and `dp[1]` plus 1 if `path[3]` is '@' or 0 if `path[3]` is '*'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`path` is a list of characters, where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is at least 4, `dp` is a list of `n` values, and `i` is 4. If `path[i]` is '*', then `dp[4]` is -float('inf'). Otherwise, `dp[4]` is the maximum of `dp[3]` and `dp[2]` plus 1 if `path[4]` is '@' or 0 if `path[4]` is '*', and `dp[5]` is the maximum of `dp[4]` and `dp[3]` plus 1 if `path[5]` is '@' or 0 if `path[5]` is '*'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
