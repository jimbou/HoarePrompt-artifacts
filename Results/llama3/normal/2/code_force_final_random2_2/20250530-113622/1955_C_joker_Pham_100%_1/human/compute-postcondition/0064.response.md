Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer reduced by twice the value of the integer at index r in list a, a is a list of n positive integers. If the value at index l in list a is 0, then l is less than r and sunks is incremented by 2 if k is greater than or equal to twice the value of the integer at index l in list a, otherwise sunks is incremented by 1. If the value at index l in list a is not 0, then l is less than or equal to r and sunks is incremented by 1 if k is greater than or equal to twice the value of the integer at index l in list a, otherwise no changes are made.***
