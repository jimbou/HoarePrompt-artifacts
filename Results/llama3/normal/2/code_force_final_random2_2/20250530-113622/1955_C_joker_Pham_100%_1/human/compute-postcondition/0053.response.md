Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer minus 2 times the value of the integer at index l in list a, a is a list of n positive integers where the value at index r is reduced by the value at index l, l is less than or equal to r. If the value at index r in list a is 0, sunks is incremented by 1 and r is reduced by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
