Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value of the integer at index `l` in list `a`, then `k` is reduced by twice the value of the integer at index `l` in list `a`, the value at index `r` in list `a` is reduced by the value at index `l`, `l` is incremented by 1, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `k` is equal to `a[l] * 2 - 1`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
