Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` and `r` are equal to some value. The current value of `l` and `r` are equal. The current value of `k` is greater than or equal to the value at index `r` in list `a`. The current value of `sunks` is 1. The current value of `a[l]` is less than or equal to the current value of `a[r]`. Additionally, `k` is less than `a[l] * 2`. The current value of `k` is equal to `a[l] * 2 - 1`***
