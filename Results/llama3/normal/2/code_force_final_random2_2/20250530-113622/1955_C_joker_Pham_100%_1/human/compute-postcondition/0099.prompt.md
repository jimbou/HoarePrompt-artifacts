Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, sunks is 0
Code of the loop:
while l <= r:
    if k == 0:
        break
    if l == r:
        if k >= a[r]:
            sunks += 1
            break
        break
    if a[l] <= a[r]:
        if k >= a[l] * 2:
            k -= a[l] * 2
            a[r] -= a[l]
            if a[r] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
            sunks += 1
            l += 1
            continue
        elif a[l] * 2 - 1 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break
    if k == 0:
        break
    if a[r] < a[l]:
        if k >= a[r] * 2:
            k -= a[r] * 2
            a[l] -= a[r]
            if a[l] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
            sunks += 1
            r -= 1
            continue
        elif a[r] * 2 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` and `r` are equal to some value. If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value at index `r` in list `a`, `k` is decreased by twice the value at index `r-1` in list `a`, the value at index `l` in list `a` is less than its original value by the value at index `r-1`, the current value of `a[r-1]` is less than the current value of `a[l]`, the current value of `a[l]` is less than or equal to the current value of `a[r-1]`, and `sunks` is increased by 1 or 2 depending on the value at index `l` in list `a`. If `k` is less than twice the value at index `r` in list `a`, then if the current value of `a[r]` multiplied by 2 is equal to `k`, `sunks` is 1 more than its previous value. Otherwise, no change occurs. The current value of `a[r]` is less than the current value of `a[l]`. If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value at index `l` in list `a`, `l` is one more than its original value, `r` is the same as its original value, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, `a[r]` is either 0 or less than its original value, and `sunks` is one more than its original value. If `a[r]` is 0, then `k` is decreased by twice the original value of `a[l]`, `a[r-1]` is 0, and `r` is one less than its original value. If `k` is less than twice the value at index `l` in list `a`, then if `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, `sunks` is 2. If `a[l] * 2 - 1` does not equal `k`, then if `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to the value at index `r` in list `a`, `sunks` is 1. If `l` is not equal to `r`, no change occurs. The current value of `a[l]` is less than or equal to the current value of `a[r]`. Additionally, `k` is less than `a[l] * 2`. If `a[l]` is greater than `a[r]`, then no change occurs.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value of the integer at index `l` in list `a`, then `k` is reduced by twice the value of the integer at index `l` in list `a`, the value at index `r` in list `a` is reduced by the value at index `l`, `l` is incremented by 1, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `k` is equal to `a[l] * 2 - 1`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value of the integer at index `r` in list `a`, then `k` is reduced by twice the value of the integer at index `r` in list `a`, `r` is reduced by 1, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[r]` is equal to half of `k`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than `r`. If `k` is 0, then no change occurs. If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value of the element at index `l` in list `a`, then `k` is decreased by twice the value of the element at index `l` in list `a`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and `l` is incremented by 1. If `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `l` equals `r`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value of the element at index `r` in list `a`, then `k` is decreased by twice the value of the element at index `r` in list `a`, the element at index `l` in list `a` is decreased by the value of the element at index `r`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and `r` is decreased by 1. If the element at index `l` in list `a` is 0, then `l` is increased by 1 and `sunks` is increased by 1. If `k` is equal to twice the value of the element at index `r` in list `a`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
