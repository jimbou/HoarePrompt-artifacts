Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than `r`. If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value of the element at index `l` in list `a`, then `k` is decreased by twice the value of the element at index `l` in list `a`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `l` equals `r`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no change occurs. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l` does not equal `r`, then no change occurs. If `a[l]` is greater than `a[r]`, then no change occurs.***
