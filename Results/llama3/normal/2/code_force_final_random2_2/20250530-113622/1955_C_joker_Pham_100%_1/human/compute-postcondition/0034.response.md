Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer less than its original value by twice the value at index r in list a, a is a list of n positive integers where the value at index l is less than its original value by the value at index r, the current value of a[r] is less than the current value of a[l], the current value of a[l] is less than or equal to the current value of a[r], the current value of k is less than twice the value at index r in list a, and the current value of k is greater than or equal to twice the value at index r in list a. If the value at index l in list a is 0, then l is increased by 1 and sunks is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
