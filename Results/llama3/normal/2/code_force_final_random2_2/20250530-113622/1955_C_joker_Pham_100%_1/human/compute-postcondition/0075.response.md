Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than `r`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no change occurs. If `k` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
