Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is equal to `n - 1`, and `sunks` is a non-negative integer.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `k` is reduced to 0, and the value of `l` and `r` are equal to `n - 1`. The list `a` contains non-negative integers, and the value of `sunks` is a non-negative integer.
