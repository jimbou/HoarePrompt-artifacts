Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than `r`. If `l` equals `r`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no change occurs. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l` does not equal `r`, then no change occurs.***
