According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` and `r` are equal to some value. For the loop to be executed one more time, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than or equal to `r`**
