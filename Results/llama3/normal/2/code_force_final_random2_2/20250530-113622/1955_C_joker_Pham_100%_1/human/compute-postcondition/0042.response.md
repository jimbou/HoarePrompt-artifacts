Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` and `r` are equal to some value. If `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value at index `r` in list `a`, then `k` is decreased by twice the value at index `r-1` in list `a`, the value at index `l` in list `a` is less than its original value by the value at index `r-1`, the current value of `a[r-1]` is less than the current value of `a[l]`, the current value of `a[l]` is less than or equal to the current value of `a[r-1]`, and `sunks` is increased by 1 or 2 depending on the value at index `l` in list `a`. If `k` is less than twice the value at index `r` in list `a`, then if the current value of `a[r]` multiplied by 2 is equal to `k`, `sunks` is 1 more than its previous value. Otherwise, no change occurs. The current value of `a[r]` is less than the current value of `a[l]`.***
