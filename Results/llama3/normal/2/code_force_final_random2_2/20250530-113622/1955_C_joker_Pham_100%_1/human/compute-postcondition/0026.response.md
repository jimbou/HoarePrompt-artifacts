Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` and `r` are equal to some value. The current value of `k` is 0. If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, then the current value of `a[l]` is less than or equal to the current value of `a[r]`, and `k` is less than `a[l] * 2`. If `a[l]` is greater than `a[r]`, then no change occurs. `sunks` is one more than its original value if `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]` and `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value at index `l` in list `a`. `sunks` is 2 if `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k` and `k` is less than twice the value at index `l` in list `a`. `sunks` is 1 if `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to the value at index `r` in list `a` and `k` is less than twice the value at index `l` in list `a`.***
