Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` and `r` are equal to some value. If `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to the value at index `r` in list `a`, then `sunks` is 1. If `l` is not equal to `r`, no change occurs. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
