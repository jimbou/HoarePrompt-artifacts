Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer minus 2 times the value of the integer at index l in list a, a is a list of n positive integers where the value at index r is reduced by the value at index l, l is less than or equal to r. If k is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. If l is equal to r and k is greater than or equal to the value at index r in list a after reduction, sunks is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
