Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` and `r` are equal to some value. The current value of `a[r]` is less than the current value of `a[l]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value at index `l` in list `a`, `l` is one more than its original value, `r` is the same as its original value, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, `a[r]` is either 0 or less than its original value, and `sunks` is one more than its original value. If `a[r]` is 0, then `k` is decreased by twice the original value of `a[l]`, `a[r-1]` is 0, and `r` is one less than its original value. If `k` is less than twice the value at index `l` in list `a`, then if `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, `sunks` is 2. If `a[l] * 2 - 1` does not equal `k`, then if `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to the value at index `r` in list `a`, `sunks` is 1. If `l` is not equal to `r`, no change occurs. The current value of `a[l]` is less than or equal to the current value of `a[r]`. Additionally, `k` is less than `a[l] * 2`. If `a[l]` is greater than `a[r]`, then no change occurs.**
