Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` and `r` are equal to some value. The current value of `a[r]` is less than the current value of `a[l]`. `k` is less than twice the value at index `r` in list `a`. The current value of `a[r]` multiplied by 2 is equal to `k`.***
