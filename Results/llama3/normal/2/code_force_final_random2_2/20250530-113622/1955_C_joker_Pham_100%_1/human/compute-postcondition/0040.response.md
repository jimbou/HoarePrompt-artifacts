Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` and `r` are equal to some value. The current value of `a[r]` is less than the current value of `a[l]`. `k` is less than twice the value at index `r` in list `a`. Twice the value at index `r` in list `a` is not equal to `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The list `a` still contains `n` positive integers, and the relationship between the values at indices `l` and `r` remains the same. The value of `k` is still less than twice the value at index `r` in list `a`, and twice the value at index `r` in list `a` is not equal to `k`.
