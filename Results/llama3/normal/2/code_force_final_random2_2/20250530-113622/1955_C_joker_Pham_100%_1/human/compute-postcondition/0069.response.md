Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value of the integer at index `r` in list `a`, then `k` is reduced by twice the value of the integer at index `r` in list `a`, `r` is reduced by 1, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[r]` is equal to half of `k`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
