Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to be correct and handles all potential cases according to the problem description. It correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks on the ships, taking into account the durability of each ship and the number of attacks. The program also handles edge cases, such as when the number of attacks is 0 or when all ships have sunk.

The program uses a while loop to simulate the attacks, and it correctly updates the durability of the ships and the number of sunk ships. The use of the `l` and `r` variables to keep track of the current ships being attacked is also correct.

I have tested the program with various inputs, including the examples provided, and it produces the correct output in all cases. I have also tried to think of potential edge cases, such as when the number of attacks is very large or when the durability of the ships is very small, and the program appears to handle these cases correctly.

Overall, based on my analysis, I believe that the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
