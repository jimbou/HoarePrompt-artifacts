Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` and `r` are equal to some value. The current value of `a[l]` is less than or equal to the current value of `a[r]`. If `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to the value at index `r` in list `a`, then the current value of `sunks` is 1. If `l` is not equal to `r`, no change occurs. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. Additionally, the current value of `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value of `a[l]`.**
