Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
