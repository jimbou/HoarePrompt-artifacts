Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, l and r are equal to some value, a[l] is less than or equal to a[r]. If a[r] is 0, then k is decreased by twice the original value of a[l], a[r-1] is 0, r is one less than its original value, and sunks is increased by 1. Otherwise, a[r] is decreased by a[l] and k is decreased by twice the value of a[l].***
