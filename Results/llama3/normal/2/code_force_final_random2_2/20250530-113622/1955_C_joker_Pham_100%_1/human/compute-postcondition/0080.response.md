Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer minus 2 times the value of the element at index l in list a, a is a list of n positive integers. If the value at index r in list a is 0, then the value at index r is reduced by the value at index l, l is less than r - 1. If l equals r - 1, then if k is greater than or equal to the value at index r - 1 in list a, sunks is incremented by 2. Otherwise, sunks is incremented by 1. If the value at index r in list a is not 0, then no change occurs.***
