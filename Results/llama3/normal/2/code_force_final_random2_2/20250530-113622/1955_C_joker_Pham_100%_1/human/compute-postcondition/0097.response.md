Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than `r`. If `k` is 0, then no change occurs. If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value of the element at index `l` in list `a`, then `k` is decreased by twice the value of the element at index `l` in list `a`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and `l` is incremented by 1. If `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `l` equals `r`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value of the element at index `r` in list `a`, then `k` is decreased by twice the value of the element at index `r` in list `a`, the element at index `l` in list `a` is decreased by the value of the element at index `r`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and `r` is decreased by 1. If the element at index `l` in list `a` is 0, then `l` is increased by 1 and `sunks` is increased by 1. If `k` is equal to twice the value of the element at index `r` in list `a`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
