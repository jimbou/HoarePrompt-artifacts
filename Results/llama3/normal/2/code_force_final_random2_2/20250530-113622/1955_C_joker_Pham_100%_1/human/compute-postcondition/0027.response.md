Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` and `r` are equal to some value. If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, then the current value of `a[l]` is less than or equal to the current value of `a[r]`, and `k` is less than `a[l] * 2`. If `a[l]` is greater than `a[r]`, then no change occurs. `sunks` is one more than its original value if `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]` and `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value at index `l` in list `a`. `sunks` is 2 if `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k` and `k` is less than twice the value at index `l` in list `a`. `sunks` is 1 if `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to the value at index `r` in list `a` and `k` is less than twice the value at index `l` in list `a`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, so the values of the variables do not change. The output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.
