Output State: **numCases is an integer between 1 and 4999 (inclusive), i is 0, stdin contains numCases - 1 test cases, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 48 (inclusive), numbers is a list of at least one integer with two fewer elements, suma is the original value of suma plus the minimum of the first two integers in the original list of numbers plus the minimum of the first two integers in the original list of numbers, a is an integer equal to the first integer in the original list of numbers, b is an integer equal to the second integer in the original list of numbers.**

In this output state, the values of numCases, i, stdin, and numInteger remain unchanged. The list of numbers has two fewer elements because the first two integers were removed and assigned to a and b. The value of suma has been updated by adding the minimum of the first two integers in the original list of numbers. The values of a and b are now equal to the first and second integers in the original list of numbers, respectively.
