Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by 2n integers. It then sorts the integers in ascending order, pairs them up, and calculates the sum of the minimum value in each pair. The function prints the sum for each test case and repeats this process for the specified number of test cases.**
