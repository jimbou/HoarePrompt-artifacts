Output State: **numCases is an integer between 3 and 4999 (inclusive), i is 2, stdin contains numCases - 4 test cases, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), numbers is a list of integers, and suma is 0.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `numCases` remains unchanged, still an integer between 3 and 4999 (inclusive). The value of `i` also remains unchanged, still 2. The `stdin` now contains `numCases - 4` test cases, as one test case has been consumed by the code. The value of `numInteger` has been updated to an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), which was read from the input. The `numbers` list is now populated with a list of integers, which were read from the input and sorted in ascending order. The value of `suma` has been reset to 0.
