Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing the n moves. Here's why:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of integers written on the whiteboard (2n) and the integers themselves.
2. It sorts the integers in ascending order, which is a crucial step to ensure that the minimum of each pair of integers is added to the score.
3. The program then enters a while loop that continues until all integers have been processed. In each iteration, it pops the first two integers from the sorted list, adds the minimum of the two to the score, and discards the two integers.
4. The program repeats this process n times, which is the number of moves required to empty the whiteboard.
5. Finally, it prints the maximum final score that can be achieved.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the number of integers is odd, the program will still work correctly because it processes the integers in pairs.
* When the integers are already sorted, the program will still work correctly because it sorts the integers again.
* When the integers are all equal, the program will still work correctly because it adds the minimum of each pair to the score, which will be the same integer.

Overall, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
