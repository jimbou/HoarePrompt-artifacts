Output State: **numCases is an integer between 1 and 4999 (inclusive), i is 0, stdin contains numCases - 1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,…,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), numbers is a list of 2n integers a_1,a_2,…,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) in ascending order, suma is 0.**

In this output state, the value of numCases has been decremented by 1 because one test case has been processed. The value of i remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code. The stdin now contains one less test case. The variable numInteger has been assigned the value of the first integer in the test case, which is between 1 and 50 (inclusive). The variable numbers has been assigned a list of 2n integers in ascending order, and the variable suma has been initialized to 0.
