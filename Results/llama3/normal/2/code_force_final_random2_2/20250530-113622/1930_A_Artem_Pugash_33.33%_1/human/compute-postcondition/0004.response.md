Output State: **numCases is an integer between 1 and 4999 (inclusive), i is 0, stdin contains numCases - 1 test cases, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), numbers is a list of at least one integer with two fewer elements, suma is the original value of suma plus the minimum of the first two integers in the original list of numbers.**

In this output state, the value of `numCases` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same, as it was not affected by the code. The value of `stdin` remains the same, as it was not modified by the code. The value of `numInteger` remains the same, as it was not modified by the code. The value of `numbers` is modified, as two elements are removed from the list. The value of `suma` is modified, as it is incremented by the minimum of the first two integers in the original list of numbers.
