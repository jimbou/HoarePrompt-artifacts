Output State: **numCases is 0, i is the original value of numCases minus 1, stdin contains 0 test cases, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), numbers is an empty list, and suma is the original value of suma plus the sum of the minimum of each pair of integers in the original list of numbers, repeated numCases times.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the number of cases (`numCases`) will be 0, the loop counter (`i`) will be the original value of `numCases` minus 1, the standard input (`stdin`) will be empty (containing 0 test cases), the number of integers (`numInteger`) will be an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), the list of numbers (`numbers`) will be empty, and the sum (`suma`) will be the original value of `suma` plus the sum of the minimum of each pair of integers in the original list of numbers, repeated `numCases` times.
