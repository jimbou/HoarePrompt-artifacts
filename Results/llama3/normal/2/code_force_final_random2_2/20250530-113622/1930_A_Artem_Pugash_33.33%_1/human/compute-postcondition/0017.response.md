The only variable in the loop head is variable numbers, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable numbers.  If numbers is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, numbers is a sorted list of numInteger - 2 integers, So for the loop to be executed one more time numbers must have at least one integer.
State: **numCases is an integer between 2 and 4999 (inclusive), i is 1, stdin contains numCases - 3 test cases, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), numbers is a sorted list of numInteger - 1 integers, suma is the original suma plus the minimum value between the two smallest integers from the original list numbers.**
