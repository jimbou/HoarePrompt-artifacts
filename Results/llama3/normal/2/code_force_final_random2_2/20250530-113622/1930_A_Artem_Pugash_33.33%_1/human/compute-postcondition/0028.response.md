The only variable in the loop head is variable numbers, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable numbers.  If numbers is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, numbers is not empty with two fewer elements, So for the loop to be executed one more time numbers must have had at least two elements initially.
State: **numCases is an integer between 3 and 4999 (inclusive), i is 2, stdin contains numCases - 4 test cases, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 48 (inclusive), numbers is not empty with at least two elements, suma is the original value of suma plus the minimum of the first two elements of the original numbers list**
