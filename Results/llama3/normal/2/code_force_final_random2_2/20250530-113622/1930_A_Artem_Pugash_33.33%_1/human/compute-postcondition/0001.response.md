To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `numCases`. The loop will execute if `numCases` is at least 1. Since `numCases` is already an integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), we can conclude that `numCases` is at least 1. Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to set `i` to 0, which is the initial value of the loop counter.

State: **`numCases` is an integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), `i` is 0, stdin contains `numCases` test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,…,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7)**
