To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `numCases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `numCases`. If `i` is less than `numCases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `numCases` is an integer between 1 and 4999 (inclusive).

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `numCases` remains the same, but since `i` is now 1, `numCases` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`numCases` is an integer between 2 and 4999 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `numCases - 2` test cases, `numInteger` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the original value of `suma` plus the sum of the minimum of each pair of integers in the original list of numbers**
