Output State: **numCases is an integer between 3 and 4999 (inclusive), i is 2, stdin contains numCases - 4 test cases, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 48 (inclusive), numbers is not empty with two fewer elements, suma is the original value of suma plus the minimum of the first two elements of the original numbers list.**

In this output state, the value of `numCases` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same, as it is not affected by the code. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 2, as two elements are removed from the `numbers` list. The value of `numInteger` decreases by 2, as two elements are removed from the `numbers` list. The `numbers` list now has two fewer elements. The value of `suma` is incremented by the minimum of the first two elements of the original `numbers` list.
