The only variable in the loop head is variable numbers, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable numbers. If numbers is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, numbers is a list of at least one integer with two fewer elements, So for the loop to be executed one more time the list of numbers must have at least one element.
State: **numCases is an integer between 1 and 4999 (inclusive), i is 0, stdin contains numCases - 1 test cases, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), numbers is a list of at least one integer with two fewer elements, suma is the original value of suma plus the minimum of the first two integers in the original list of numbers, numbers must have at least one element**
