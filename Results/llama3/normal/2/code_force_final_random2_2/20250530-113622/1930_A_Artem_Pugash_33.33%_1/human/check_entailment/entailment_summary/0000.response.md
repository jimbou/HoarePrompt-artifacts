Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of integers (n) and the 2n integers, and sorts them in ascending order.
3.  It then pairs up the integers and calculates the sum of the minimum value in each pair. This is the key step in solving the problem, as it ensures that the maximum final score is achieved by always choosing the minimum value between two integers.
4.  Finally, the program prints the sum for each test case, which represents the maximum final score that can be achieved.

The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the example input and output provided in the problem description match the program's expected output.

Correctness: **True**
