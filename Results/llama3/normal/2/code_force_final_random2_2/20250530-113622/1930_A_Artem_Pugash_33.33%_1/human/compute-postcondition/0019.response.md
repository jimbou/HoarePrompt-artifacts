To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of the variable `numbers` in the loop head. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `numbers`. If `numbers` is not an empty list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a sorted list of `numInteger - 3` integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `numbers` must not be an empty list, so it must have at least one integer.

State: **`numCases` is an integer between 2 and 4999 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `numCases - 3` test cases, `numInteger` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `numbers` is a sorted list of at least 1 integer, `suma` is the original `suma` plus the minimum value between the two smallest integers from the original list `numbers` plus the minimum value between the two smallest integers from the original list `numbers`**
