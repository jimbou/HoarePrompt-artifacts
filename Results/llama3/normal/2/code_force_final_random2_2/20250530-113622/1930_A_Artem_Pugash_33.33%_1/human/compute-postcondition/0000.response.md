Output State: **`numCases` is an integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), stdin contains `numCases` test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,…,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).**

In this output state, `numCases` is assigned the value of the first integer input from stdin, which is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive). The remaining input in stdin consists of `numCases` test cases, each containing an integer n followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,…,a_{2n}. The values of n and a_i are within the specified ranges.
