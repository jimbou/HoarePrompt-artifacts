Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing n moves, where each move involves choosing two integers x and y from the whiteboard, adding min(x, y) to the score, and erasing x and y from the whiteboard.

2. The given program sorts the input numbers in ascending order, which is a correct approach to maximize the score. By sorting the numbers, we can ensure that we are always choosing the smallest possible pair of numbers, which will result in the maximum score.

3. The program then enters a while loop that continues until all numbers have been processed. In each iteration, it pops the first two numbers from the sorted list, converts them to integers, and adds the minimum of the two numbers to the score.

4. The program correctly handles the case where there are an even number of integers on the whiteboard, as it will always choose two numbers in each move.

5. The program also correctly handles the case where there are duplicate numbers on the whiteboard, as it will treat them as separate numbers and choose the smallest pair in each move.

6. The program does not have any errors in terms of syntax or logic, and it correctly implements the required algorithm to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
