Output State: **numCases is an integer between 3 and 4999 (inclusive), i is 2, stdin contains numCases - 4 test cases, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), numbers is an empty list, suma is the original value of suma plus the sum of the minimum of each pair of adjacent elements in the original numbers list.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `numbers` list is empty, and the `suma` variable has accumulated the sum of the minimum of each pair of adjacent elements in the original `numbers` list. The other variables remain unchanged.
