Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length.
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    f = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if f == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
                f = 1
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
        
    #State: a is a list of digits from the first pair of integers with all elements being greater than or equal to the corresponding elements of b, b is a list of digits from the second pair of integers, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, i is the length of a, f is 1.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: a is a list of digits from the first pair of integers with all elements being greater than or equal to the corresponding elements of b, b is a list of digits from the second pair of integers, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, i is the length of a, f is 1, and all elements of a which are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements of b are printed.
    print()
    #This is printed: nothing
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: `a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers with all elements being greater than or equal to the corresponding elements of `b`, `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers, `stdin` contains `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `i` is equal to the length of `b`, `f` is 1, and all elements of `a` which are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements of `b` are printed, and nothing is printed, and all elements of `b` are printed.
    print()
    #This is printed: Nothing

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two pairs of integers as input from the standard input, compares the pairs digit by digit, and prints the pair with the larger or equal digits first, followed by the other pair. If the first pair is smaller, it swaps the pairs before printing. The function repeats this process for multiple pairs of integers, as specified by the initial input.

Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
