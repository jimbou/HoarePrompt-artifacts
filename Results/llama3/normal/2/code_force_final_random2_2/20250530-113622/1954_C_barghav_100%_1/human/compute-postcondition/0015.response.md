The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of list `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `a` has at least 1 element. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `a` must have at least 2 elements.
State: **`a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers, `stdin` contains `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `i` is 1**
