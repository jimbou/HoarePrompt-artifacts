Output State: **`a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers, `stdin` contains `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `i` is 1, `a[1]` and `b[1]` have been swapped.**

In natural language, the output state is: The lists `a` and `b` have been modified such that their elements at index 1 have been swapped. The rest of the variables and stdin remain unchanged.
