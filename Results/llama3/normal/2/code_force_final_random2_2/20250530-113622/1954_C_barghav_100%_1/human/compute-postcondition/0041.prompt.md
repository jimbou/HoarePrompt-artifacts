Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of digits from the first pair of integers with all elements being greater than or equal to the corresponding elements of b, b is a list of digits from the second pair of integers, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, i is the length of a, f is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    print(a[i], end='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers with all elements being greater than or equal to the corresponding elements of `b`, `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers, `stdin` contains `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `i` is 0, `f` is 1, `a` must have at least 1 element, and the first element of the list `a` which is greater than or equal to the corresponding element of `b` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers with all elements being greater than or equal to the corresponding elements of `b`, `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers, `stdin` contains `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `i` is 1, `f` is 1, `a` must have at least 2 elements, and the second element of the list `a` which is greater than or equal to the corresponding element of `b` is being printed, and the second element of the list `a` which is greater than or equal to the corresponding element of `b` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers with all elements being greater than or equal to the corresponding elements of `b`, `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers, `stdin` contains `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `i` is 2, `f` is 1, `a` must have at least 3 elements, and the third element of the list `a` which is greater than or equal to the corresponding element of `b` is being printed, and the third element of the list `a` which is greater than or equal to the corresponding element of `b` is printed, and the third element of the list `a` which is greater than or equal to the corresponding element of `b` is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
