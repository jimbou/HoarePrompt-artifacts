This function takes two pairs of integers as input from the standard input, compares the pairs digit by digit, and prints the pair with the larger or equal digits first, followed by the other pair. If the first pair is smaller, it swaps the pairs before printing. The function repeats this process for multiple pairs of integers, as specified by the initial input.
