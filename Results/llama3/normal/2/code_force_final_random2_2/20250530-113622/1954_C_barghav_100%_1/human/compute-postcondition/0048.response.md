The code prints the element at index 1 of the list `b` which is the second element of the list `b`. Since `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers and must have at least 2 elements, the second element of `b` is a digit from 1 to 9.
Output: **the second element of the list b (which is a digit from 1 to 9)**
