Postcondition: **`a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers, `f` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `i` is 0. The current value of `f` is 0. Additionally, the current value of `a[i]` is less than the current value of `b[i]`.**
