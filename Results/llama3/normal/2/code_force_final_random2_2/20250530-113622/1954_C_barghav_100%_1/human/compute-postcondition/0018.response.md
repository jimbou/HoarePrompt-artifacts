Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers, `stdin` contains `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `i` is 1. If the digit at index `i` in `a` is greater than the digit at index `i` in `b`, then `f` is set to 1.***
