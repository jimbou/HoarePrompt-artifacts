Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers, `stdin` contains `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `i` is 1. If the digit at index `i` in `a` is less than the digit at index `i` in `b`, then the second element of `a` is swapped with the second element of `b`, and `f` is set to 1. If the digit at index `i` in `a` is greater than the digit at index `i` in `b`, then `f` is set to 1. If the digit at index `i` in `a` is equal to the digit at index `i` in `b`, then if `a[1]` is greater than `b[1]`, `a[1]` and `b[1]` have been swapped. Otherwise, no changes have been made.***
