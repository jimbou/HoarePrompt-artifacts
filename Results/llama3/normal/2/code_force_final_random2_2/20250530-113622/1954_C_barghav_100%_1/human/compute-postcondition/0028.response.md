The code swaps the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, where `i` is 2. This means that the third element of `a` and the third element of `b` are exchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers that must have at least 3 elements, but the third element is now the third element of the original `b`, `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers, but the third element is now the third element of the original `a`, `stdin` contains `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `i` is 2**
