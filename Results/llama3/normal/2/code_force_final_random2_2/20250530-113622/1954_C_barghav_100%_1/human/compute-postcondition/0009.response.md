Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers, `stdin` contains `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `i` is 0. If the ith element of `a` is less than the ith element of `b`, then `a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers with the ith element being greater than the ith element of `b`, `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers with the ith element being less than the ith element of `a`, and `f` is 1. Otherwise, `f` is 1 if the ith element of `a` is greater than the ith element of `b`, otherwise `f` remains 0.***
