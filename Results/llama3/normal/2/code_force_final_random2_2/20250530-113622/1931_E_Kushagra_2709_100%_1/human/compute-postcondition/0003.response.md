Output State: **`num` is a string representation of its original non-negative integer value that must have at least 2 characters, `tot` is 0, `i` is `len(num) - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `num`, `tot`, and `i` remain unchanged because the `break` statement only exits the current loop or if statement without modifying any variables. The condition that `num[i]` is not '0' is still valid, and `i` is still equal to `len(num) - 1`.
