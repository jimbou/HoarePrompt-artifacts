Output State: **`num` is a string representation of its original non-negative integer value that must have at least 2 characters, `tot` is 2, `i` is `len(num) - 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `num`, `tot`, and `i` remain unchanged because the `break` statement only exits the innermost loop or if statement, without modifying any variables. The precondition that `num` has at least 2 characters and `i` is equal to `len(num) - 3` still holds true.
