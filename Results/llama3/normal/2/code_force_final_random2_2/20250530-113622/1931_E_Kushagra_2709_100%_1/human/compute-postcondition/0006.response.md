To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to continue.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):`, which means that `i` will decrease by 1 in each iteration until it reaches -1.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(num) - 1`, which means that the loop has not yet reached the end of the string `num`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

* `i` will decrease by 1, so it will be `len(num) - 2`.
* `num` is still a string representation of its original non-negative integer value, and its length is still at least 2.
* `tot` is still 1, as there is no information that would change its value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`num` is a string representation of its original non-negative integer value that must have at least 2 characters, `tot` is 1, `i` is `len(num) - 2**
