Output State: **`num` is a string representation of its original non-negative integer value, `tot` is the number of trailing zeros in `num`, `i` is -1.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `num` remains unchanged, `tot` will be equal to the number of trailing zeros in the original string `num`, and `i` will be -1, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
