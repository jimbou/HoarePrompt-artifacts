Determines the winner of a game based on the total number of digits in a list of integers and the number of zeros in those integers. The function takes a list of positive integers and a non-negative integer as input, calculates the total number of digits minus the sum of every other number of zeros, and returns 'Sasha' if this total is greater than or equal to the non-negative integer plus 1, otherwise returns 'Anna'.
