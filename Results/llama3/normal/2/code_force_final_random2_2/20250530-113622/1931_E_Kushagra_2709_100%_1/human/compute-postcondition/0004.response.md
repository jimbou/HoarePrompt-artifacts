Postcondition: ***`num` is a string representation of its original non-negative integer value that must have at least 2 characters, `tot` is 0, `i` is `len(num) - 1`. If the last character of `num` is not '0', the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
