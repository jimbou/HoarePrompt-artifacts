Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the game logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` calculates the total number of digits in the list of numbers and then subtracts the number of trailing zeros in the numbers that Anna can reverse. This is done by sorting the numbers based on the number of trailing zeros in descending order and then subtracting the number of trailing zeros in every other number (starting from the first one).

The function `zerocnts` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a given number by converting the number to a string and then iterating over the characters from right to left until a non-zero character is found.

The program then compares the total number of digits (after Anna's moves) with the given parameter `m` and returns "Sasha" if the total number of digits is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, and "Anna" otherwise.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where the list of numbers is empty, the case where all numbers have no trailing zeros, and the case where all numbers have trailing zeros. The program also correctly handles the case where the parameter `m` is 0.

Therefore, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
