To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `num`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `num` has at least 2 characters (since the range starts from `len(num) - 1` and goes down to `-1`). 

At the end of the last iteration, `tot` is 0. So for the loop to be executed, `num` must have at least 2 characters and `i` is `len(num) - 1`.

State: **`num` is a string representation of its original non-negative integer value that must have at least 2 characters, `tot` is 0, `i` is `len(num) - 1**
