Output State: **`num` is a string representation of its original non-negative integer value that must have at least 2 characters, `tot` is 1, `i` is `len(num) - 1`. If the last character of `num` is not '0', the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

In this output state, the value of `tot` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged. The condition regarding the last character of `num` and the function breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement also remains the same.
