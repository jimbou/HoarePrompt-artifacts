Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the game logic described in the problem statement. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the total number of digits in the list of integers minus the sum of every other number of zeros in each integer, and returns 'Sasha' if this total is greater than or equal to the non-negative integer `m` plus 1, otherwise returns 'Anna'. The `zerocnts` function correctly counts and returns the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of a non-negative integer.

The program correctly handles the game logic, where Anna's moves involve reversing the digits of an integer, and Sasha's moves involve concatenating two integers. The program also correctly determines the winner of the game based on the total number of digits in the integers and the number of zeros in those integers.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
