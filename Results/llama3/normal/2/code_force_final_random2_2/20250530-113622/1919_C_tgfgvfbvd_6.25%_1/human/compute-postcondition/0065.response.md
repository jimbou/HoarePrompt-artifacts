The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `int(input())` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. So for the loop to be executed one more time stdin must contain multiple test cases minus two.
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, l is a list of n integers between 1 and n, y is equal to n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, x is equal to n. Either a is the smallest integer in the list and b is the largest integer in the list, or a is the largest integer in the list and b is the smallest integer in the list. c is equal to the number of times an integer in the list is greater than both a and b, and the number of times an integer in the list is greater than both a and b is being printed**
