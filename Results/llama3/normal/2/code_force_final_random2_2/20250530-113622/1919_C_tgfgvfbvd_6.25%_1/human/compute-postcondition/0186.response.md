Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of at least 2 integers between 1 and `n`, `x` is equal to `n - 1`, `y` is `n - 2`, `c` is either 0, 1 or 2. If `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, then `a` is equal to `l[n-1]` and `b` is either equal to `l[n-1]` or the first integer in the list `l` that is greater than the previous integer and is less than `l[n-1]`. Otherwise, `a` is either equal to `l[n-1]` or the first integer in the list `l` that is greater than the previous integer and is less than `l[n-1]`, and `b` is equal to `l[n-1]`.***
