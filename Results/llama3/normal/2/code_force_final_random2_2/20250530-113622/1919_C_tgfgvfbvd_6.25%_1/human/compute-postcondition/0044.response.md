Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is `y + 2`, `a` is equal to `l[y + 2]`, `b` is updated based on the value of `l[x]`, `c` is either increased by 1 or remains the same.**

In this output state, the value of `a` is updated to be equal to the value of `l[x]`, which is `l[y + 2]`. The value of `b` is updated based on the comparison between `l[x]` and `b`, but its exact value is not specified. The value of `c` is either increased by 1 or remains the same, depending on whether `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`. The values of `n`, `l`, `y`, `x`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
