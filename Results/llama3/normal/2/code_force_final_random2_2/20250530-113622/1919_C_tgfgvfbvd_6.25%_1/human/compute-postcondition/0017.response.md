Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `a` is the first integer in the list, `b` is the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, `c` is 0, `y` is less than `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is `y + 1`. The current value of `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, and `l[x] - a` is less than `l[x] - b`***
