Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, l is a list of n integers between 1 and n, a is the first integer in the list, b is 0, c is 0, y is 0, x is not affected and remains equal to its original value which is equal to the original value of n
Code of the loop:
for y in range(1, n):
    if l[y] > l[y - 1]:
        b = l[y]
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `a` is the first integer in the list, `x` is equal to the original value of `n`, and `y` is 1. If the second integer in the list is greater than the first integer, then `b` is set to the value of the second integer and `c` remains 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `b` and `c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than 2, l is a list of n integers between 1 and n, a is the first integer in the list, x is equal to the original value of n, y is 2, and c is 0. If the second integer in the list is greater than the first integer, then b is the second integer in the list. Otherwise, b is not changed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than 2, l is a list of n integers between 1 and n, a is the first integer in the list, x is equal to the original value of n, y is 3, and c is 0. If the integer at index 3 in the list is greater than the integer at index 2 in the list, then b is the integer at index 3 in the list. Otherwise, b is not changed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
