Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is equal to `n`, `x` is equal to `n`, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 0. If there exists an integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, `a` is equal to the maximum integer in the list, `b` is equal to the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or 0 if no such integer exists. Otherwise, `a` is equal to the first integer in the list, `b` is equal to 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` and `l` remain unchanged, `y` and `x` are equal to `n`, and `c` is a non-negative integer. The values of `a` and `b` depend on whether there exists an integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer. If such an integer exists, `a` is the maximum integer in the list, and `b` is the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or 0 if no such integer exists. If no such integer exists, `a` is the first integer in the list, and `b` is 0.
