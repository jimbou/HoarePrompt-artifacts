Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is equal to `n - 1`, `x` is equal to `n`, `c` is 0, `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `l[x]` is greater than `b`. If the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`, then `a` is equal to `l[x]`, `b` is equal to the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or 0 if no such integer exists. Otherwise, `a` is the first integer in the list, `b` is equal to `l[x]`.***
