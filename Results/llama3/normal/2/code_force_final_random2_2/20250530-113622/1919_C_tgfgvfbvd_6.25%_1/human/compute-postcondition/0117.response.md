Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is greater than `n + 1`, `x` is equal to `n + 2`, `c` is 2 if `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `l[x]` is greater than `b`, otherwise `c` is 1. If `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `l[x]` is greater than `b`, then if the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`, `a` is equal to `l[x]` and `b` is either the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or 0 if no such integer exists. Otherwise, `b` is equal to `l[x]` and `a` is either equal to `l[x]`, the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or 0 if no such integer exists, or the first integer in the list, or less than `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, then if `l[x]` is less than `a` and `l[x]` is less than `b`, if the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, `a` is equal to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is equal to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `b`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, `a` is equal to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is equal to `l[x]` and `a` is less than `l[x]`.**
