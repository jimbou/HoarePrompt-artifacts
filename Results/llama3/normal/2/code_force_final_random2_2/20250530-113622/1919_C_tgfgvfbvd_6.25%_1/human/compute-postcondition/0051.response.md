Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is less than `n - 2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is `y + 3`, `b` is `l[y + 3]`, `a` is updated based on the value of `l[x]`, and `c` is increased by 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to be the integer at index `x` in the list `l`, which is `l[y + 3]`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. Note that `a` is still updated based on the value of `l[x]`, but its new value is not explicitly stated, as it depends on the specific value of `l[x]`. Similarly, `c` may have been increased by 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, but its new value is not explicitly stated.
