The code prints the value of `c`, which is the number of times an integer in the list `l` is greater than both `a` and `b`. Since `a` and `b` are either the smallest and largest integers in the list or vice versa, `c` represents the count of integers in the list that are greater than both the smallest and largest integers.

Output: **the number of times an integer in the list l is greater than both the smallest and largest integers in the list**
