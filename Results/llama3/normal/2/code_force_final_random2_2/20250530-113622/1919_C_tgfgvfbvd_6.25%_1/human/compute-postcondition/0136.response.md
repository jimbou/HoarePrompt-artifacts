To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `y` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be incremented by 1, so `y` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `y` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `l`, `a`, `x`, `b`, and `c` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `a` is the first integer in the list, `x` is equal to the original value of `n`, `y` is 2, `b` is the second integer in the list if it is greater than the first integer, otherwise `b` is not changed, and `c` is 0**
