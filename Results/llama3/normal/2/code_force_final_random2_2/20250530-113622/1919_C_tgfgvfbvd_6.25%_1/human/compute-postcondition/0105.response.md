Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is equal to `n`, `x` is equal to `n + 1`, `c` is 2 if `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `l[x]` is greater than `b`, otherwise `c` is 1.**

The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `c` is 1 if `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `l[x]` is greater than `b`, otherwise it is 0. Therefore, the new value of `c` is 2 if `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `l[x]` is greater than `b`, otherwise it is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.
