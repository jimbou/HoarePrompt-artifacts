Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is `y + 2`. Either `a` or `b` is updated to the value of `l[x]` based on the difference between `l[x]` and `a` or `b`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, `c` is increased by 1.**
