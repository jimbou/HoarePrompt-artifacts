Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is equal to `n - 1`, `x` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `a` is equal to `l[x]`, `b` is equal to the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or 0 if no such integer exists, `c` is 0. Either `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`. The current value of `l[x]` is less than `a` and also less than `b`. The difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` is updated to be equal to the value of `l[x]`. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` still contains `n` integers between 1 and `n`, and `x` is still equal to `n`. The value of `y` is still `n - 1`, and `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus two. The value of `b` is still the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or 0 if no such integer exists, and `c` is still 0. The conditions regarding the relationships between `l[x]`, `a`, and `b` are still satisfied.
