Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is less than `n - 2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is `y + 3`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `a` is equal to `l[y + 3]`, `b` is updated based on the value of `l[x]`, and `c` is increased by 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`. Otherwise, `a` is updated based on the value of `l[x]`, `b` is equal to `l[x]`, and `c` is increased by 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`.***
