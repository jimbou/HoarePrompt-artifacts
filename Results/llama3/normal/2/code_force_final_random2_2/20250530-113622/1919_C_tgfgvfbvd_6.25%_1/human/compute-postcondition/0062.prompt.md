Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, l is a list of n integers between 1 and n, a is the first integer in the list, b is the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, c is 0, y is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
        if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
        c += 1
    elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
        if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    elif a >= l[x]:
        a = l[x]
    else:
        b = l[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is less than `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is `y + 1`. `a` and `b` are updated based on the value of `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, `c` is increased by 1 and either `a` or `b` is updated to the value of `l[x]` based on the difference between `l[x]` and `a` or `b`. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then either `a` or `b` is updated to the value of `l[x]` based on whether `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b` or not, and the difference between `l[x]` and `a` or `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is `y + 2`. Either `a` or `b` is updated to the value of `l[x]` based on whether `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, or greater than both `a` and `b`, or neither. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, `c` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `c` remains the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is less than `n - 2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is `y + 3`. Either `a` is `l[y + 3]` and `b` is updated based on the value of `l[x]`, or `b` is `l[y + 3]` and `a` is updated based on the value of `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is increased by 1. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is updated based on the value of `l[x]`, `b` is updated based on the value of `l[x]`, and `c` is increased by 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`. If `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `a` or `b`, then `a` is equal to `l[y + 3]`, `b` is updated based on the value of `l[x]`, and `c` is increased by 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
