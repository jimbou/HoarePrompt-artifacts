Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is less than `n - 2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is `y + 3`, `a` is updated based on the value of `l[x]`, `b` is `l[x]`, and `c` is increased by 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to be equal to the value of `l[x]`, which is the `x`-th element of the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `n` still being an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `l` still being a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` still being less than `n - 2`, `stdin` still containing multiple test cases minus one, `x` still being `y + 3`, and `a` still being updated based on the value of `l[x]`. Additionally, `c` is still increased by 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`.
