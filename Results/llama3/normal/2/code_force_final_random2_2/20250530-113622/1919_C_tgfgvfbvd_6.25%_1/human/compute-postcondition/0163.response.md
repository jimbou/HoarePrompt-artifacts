Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `x` is equal to `n`, `y` is `n - 1`, and `c` is 0. Either `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`. Additionally, `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, meaning either `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `a` is equal to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `l[x]` and `b` is the integer at index `x` in the list.***
