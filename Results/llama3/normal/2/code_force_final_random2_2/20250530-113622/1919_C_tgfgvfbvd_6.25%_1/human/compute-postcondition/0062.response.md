Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, l is a list of n integers between 1 and n, y is equal to n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is equal to n. Either a is the smallest integer in the list and b is the largest integer in the list, or a is the largest integer in the list and b is the smallest integer in the list. c is equal to the number of times an integer in the list is greater than both a and b.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state is such that the loop has iterated over the entire list `l` from index `y + 1` to `n`. The variables `a` and `b` have been updated to be either the smallest and largest integers in the list, or vice versa. The variable `c` has been incremented each time an integer in the list is greater than both `a` and `b`. The other variables `n`, `l`, `y`, and `stdin` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
