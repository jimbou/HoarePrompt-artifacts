Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of at least 2 integers between 1 and `n`, `x` is equal to `n - 1`, `y` is `n - 2`, `c` is either 1, 2 or 3. If `l[x] - a` is greater than or equal to `l[x] - b`, then `a` is equal to `l[n-1]` and `b` is either equal to `l[n-1]` or the first integer in the list `l` that is greater than the previous integer and is less than `l[n-1]`. Otherwise, `a` is either equal to `l[n-1]` or the first integer in the list `l` that is greater than the previous integer and is less than `l[n-1]`, and `b` is equal to `l[n-1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `c` has been incremented by 1, and its new value is either 1, 2, or 3. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
