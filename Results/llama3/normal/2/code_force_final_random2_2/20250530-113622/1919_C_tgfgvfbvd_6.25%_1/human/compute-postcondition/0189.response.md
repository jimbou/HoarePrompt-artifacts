Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of at least 2 integers between 1 and `n`, `x` is equal to `n - 1`, `y` is `n - 2`, `c` is either 0, 1 or 2. If `a` is greater than or equal to the last element of the list `l`, then `a` is equal to the last element of the list `l` and `b` is either equal to the last element of the list `l` or the first integer in the list `l` that is greater than the previous integer and is less than the last element of the list `l`. Otherwise, `a` is either equal to the last element of the list `l` or the first integer in the list `l` that is greater than the previous integer and is less than the last element of the list `l`, and `b` is equal to the last element of the list `l`.**
