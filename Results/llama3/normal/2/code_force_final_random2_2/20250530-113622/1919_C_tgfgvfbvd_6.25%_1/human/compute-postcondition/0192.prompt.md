Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, l is a list of n integers between 1 and n, a is the first integer in the list, x is equal to the original value of n, y is n-1, and c is 0. If there exists an integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, then b is the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer. Otherwise, b is 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
        if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
        c += 1
    elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
        if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    elif a >= l[x]:
        a = l[x]
    else:
        b = l[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `x` is equal to `n`, `y` is `n - 1`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 1, and either `a` is `l[n]` or `a` is the first integer in the list `l` that is greater than the previous integer `b` and is less than `l[n]`, and either `b` is `l[n]` or `b` is the first integer in the list `l` that is greater than the previous integer `a` and is less than `l[n]`. Otherwise, `c` is 0. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, then either `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, or `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then either `a` is equal to `l[x]` and `b` is either 0 or the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or `a` is the first integer in the list and `b` is equal to `l[x]`. In the first case, the current value of `l[x]` is less than `b` and the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`. In the second case, the current value of `l[x]` is less than `a` and the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is greater than the difference between `b` and `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then either `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `a` is equal to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `l[x]` and `b` is the integer at index `x` in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `x` is equal to `n + 1`, `y` is `n - 1`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is either 1 or 2. If `l[x] - a` is greater than or equal to `l[x] - b`, then `a` is equal to `l[n+1]` and either `b` is `l[n]` or `b` is the first integer in the list `l` that is greater than the previous integer `a` and is less than `l[n]`. Otherwise, `b` is equal to `l[n+1]` and `a` is either equal to `l[n]` or the first integer in the list `l` that is greater than the previous integer `b` and is less than `l[n]`. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is either 0 or 1. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then either `a` is equal to `l[x]` and `b` is either `l[n]` or the first integer in the list `l` that is greater than the previous integer `a` and is less than `l[n]`, or `a` is the first integer in the list and `b` is equal to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then either `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `a` is equal to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `l[x]` and `b` is the integer at index `x` in the list. After the if-else block, `a` is either `l[n+1]` or the first integer in the list `l` that is greater than the previous integer `b` and is less than `l[n]`, and `b` is either `l[n]` or the first integer in the list `l` that is greater than the previous integer `a` and is less than `l[n]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of at least 2 integers between 1 and `n`, `x` is equal to `n - 1`, `y` is `n - 2`, `c` is either 0, 1, 2 or 3. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then if `l[x] - a` is greater than or equal to `l[x] - b`, `a` is equal to `l[n-1]` and `b` is either equal to `l[n-1]` or the first integer in the list `l` that is greater than the previous integer and is less than `l[n-1]`. Otherwise, `a` is either equal to `l[n-1]` or the first integer in the list `l` that is greater than the previous integer and is less than `l[n-1]`, and `b` is equal to `l[n-1]`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then if `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, `a` is equal to `l[n-1]` and `b` is either equal to `l[n-1]` or the first integer in the list `l` that is greater than the previous integer and is less than `l[n-1]`. Otherwise, `a` is either equal to `l[n-1]` or the first integer in the list `l` that is greater than the previous integer and is less than `l[n-1]`, and `b` is equal to `l[n-1]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to the last element of the list `l`, `a` is equal to the last element of the list `l` and `b` is either equal to the last element of the list `l` or the first integer in the list `l` that is greater than the previous integer and is less than the last element of the list `l`. Otherwise, `a` is either equal to the last element of the list `l` or the first integer in the list `l` that is greater than the previous integer and is less than the last element of the list `l`, and `b` is equal to the last element of the list `l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
