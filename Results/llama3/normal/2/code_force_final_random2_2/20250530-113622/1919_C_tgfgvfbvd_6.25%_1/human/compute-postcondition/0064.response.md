Output: **n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, l is a list of n integers between 1 and n, y is equal to n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is equal to n. Either a is the smallest integer in the list and b is the largest integer in the list, or a is the largest integer in the list and b is the smallest integer in the list. c is equal to the number of times an integer in the list is greater than both a and b, and the number of times an integer in the list is greater than both a and b is being printed**
