Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, l is a list of n integers between 1 and n, y is 0, x is equal to n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, a is the first integer in the list, b is 0, c is 0.**

In this output state, the value of n is updated to the integer value of the input, and l is updated to a list of n integers from the input. The value of y is reset to 0. The value of x remains the same as n. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by two. The value of a is updated to the first integer in the list, and the values of b and c are reset to 0.
