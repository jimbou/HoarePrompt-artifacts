The only variables in the loop head are variables  y and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `y` and `n`. If `y` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1, `n` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2*10^5. For the loop to execute again `y` must be increased by 1 so `y` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 2*10^5, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `a` is the first integer in the list, `y` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the current value of `l[y]` is greater than the current value of `l[y - 1]`, then `b` is equal to the value of `l[y]` and `c` is 0. Otherwise, the values of `b` and `c` remain unchanged.**
