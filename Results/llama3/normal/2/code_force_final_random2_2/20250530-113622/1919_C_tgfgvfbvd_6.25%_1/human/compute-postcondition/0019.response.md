Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is less than `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is `y + 1`. The current value of `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`. If the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`, then `a` is updated to the value of `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to the value of `l[x]`.***
