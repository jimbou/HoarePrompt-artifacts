Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is equal to `n - 1`, `x` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `a` is the first integer in the list, `b` is equal to `l[x]`, `c` is 0. Either `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`. The current value of `l[x]` is less than `a` and also less than `b`. The difference between `a` and `l[x]` is greater than the difference between `b` and `l[x]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `b` is updated to be equal to the value of `l[x]`, which is less than `a` and also less than the previous value of `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` still contains `n` integers between 1 and `n`, and the current value of `l[x]` is still less than `a` and also less than `b`. The difference between `a` and `l[x]` is still greater than the difference between `b` and `l[x]`.
