Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is equal to `n - 1`, `x` is equal to `n`. `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two. `a` is the first integer in the list. `b` is equal to the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or 0 if no such integer exists. `c` is 0. The current value of `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `l[x]` is greater than `b`. The difference between `l[x]` and `a` is less than the difference between `l[x]` and `b`.***
