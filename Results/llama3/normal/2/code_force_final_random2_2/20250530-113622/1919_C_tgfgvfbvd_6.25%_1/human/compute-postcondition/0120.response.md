Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is greater than `n + 1`, `x` is equal to `n + 2`, `c` is 2 if `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `l[x]` is greater than `b`, otherwise `c` is 1, `b` is equal to `l[x]`, `a` is either equal to `l[x]` or less than `l[x]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than or equal to 3, the list `l` still contains `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is still greater than `n + 1`, and `x` is still equal to `n + 2`. The value of `c` depends on the comparison between `l[x]` and the previous values of `a` and `b`. The value of `b` is now equal to `l[x]`, and the value of `a` is either equal to `l[x]` or less than `l[x]`, depending on the previous values of `a` and `b`.
