Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `x` is equal to `n + 1`, `y` is `n - 1`, `c` is either 0 or 1. If `l[x] - a` is greater than or equal to `l[x] - b`, then `a` is equal to `l[n+1]` and either `b` is `l[n]` or `b` is the first integer in the list `l` that is greater than the previous integer `a` and is less than `l[n]`. Otherwise, `b` is equal to `l[n+1]` and `a` is either equal to `l[n]` or the first integer in the list `l` that is greater than the previous integer `b` and is less than `l[n]`.***
