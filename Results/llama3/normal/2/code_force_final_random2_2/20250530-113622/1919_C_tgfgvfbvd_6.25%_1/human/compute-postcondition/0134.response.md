Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, l is a list of n integers between 1 and n, a is the first integer in the list, b is equal to the value of l[y], c is 0, x is equal to the original value of n, y is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to be equal to the value of `l[y]`, which is the second element in the list `l` since `y` is 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
