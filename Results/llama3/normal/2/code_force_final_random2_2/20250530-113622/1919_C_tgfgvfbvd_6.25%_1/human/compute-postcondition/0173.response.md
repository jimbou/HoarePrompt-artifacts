Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `x` is equal to `n + 1`, `y` is `n - 1`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 1. If `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, then `a` is equal to `l[x]` and `b` is either `l[n]` or the first integer in the list `l` that is greater than the previous integer `a` and is less than `l[n]`. Otherwise, `b` is equal to `l[x]` and `a` is either `l[n]` or the first integer in the list `l` that is greater than the previous integer `b` and is less than `l[n]`. In both cases, `c` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b` or not.**
