Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `a` is the integer at index `x` in the list, `b` is the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, `c` is 0, `y` is less than `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is `y + 1`. Either `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`. `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`. The current value of `a` is equal to the value of `l[x]`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to be the integer at index `x` in the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the relationships between `l[x]`, `a`, and `b` are still valid, but now `a` is equal to `l[x]`.
