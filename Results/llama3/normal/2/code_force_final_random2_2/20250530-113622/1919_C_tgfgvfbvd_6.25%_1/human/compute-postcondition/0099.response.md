Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is equal to `n - 1`, `x` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `c` is 0. Either `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`. Either `a` is equal to `l[x]` or `b` is equal to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is less than `a` and `l[x]` is less than `b`, then if the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, `a` is equal to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is equal to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `b`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, `a` is equal to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is equal to `l[x]` and `a` is less than `l[x]`.***
