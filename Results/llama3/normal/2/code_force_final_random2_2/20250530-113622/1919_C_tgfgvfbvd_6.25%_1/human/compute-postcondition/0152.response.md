Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `a` is the first integer in the list, `x` is equal to `n`, `y` is `n - 1`, `b` is either 0 or the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, and `c` is 0. The current value of `l[x]` is less than `a` and less than `b`. Either `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`.**
