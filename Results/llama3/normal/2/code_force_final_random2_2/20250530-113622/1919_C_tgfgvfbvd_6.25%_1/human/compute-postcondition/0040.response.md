Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is `y + 2`, Either `a` or `b` is updated to the value of `l[x]` based on the difference between `l[x]` and `a` or `b`, `c` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been increased by 1, while the values of the other variables remain the same. The list `l` still contains `n` integers between 1 and `n`, and `y` is still less than `n - 1`. The value of `x` is still `y + 2`, and either `a` or `b` is still updated to the value of `l[x]` based on the difference between `l[x]` and `a` or `b`. The number of test cases in `stdin` has decreased by one.
