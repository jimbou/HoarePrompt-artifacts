Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `a` is the first integer in the list, `b` is `l[x]`, `c` is 0, `y` is less than `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is `y + 1`. Either `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`. `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`. `a` is less than `l[x]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `b` has been updated to be the value of `l[x]`, which is the integer at index `x` in the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` still contains `n` integers between 1 and `n`, and `a` is still the first integer in the list. The relationship between `l[x]`, `a`, and `b` has been updated, with `b` now being equal to `l[x]`. The values of `c`, `y`, `stdin`, and `x` remain the same.
