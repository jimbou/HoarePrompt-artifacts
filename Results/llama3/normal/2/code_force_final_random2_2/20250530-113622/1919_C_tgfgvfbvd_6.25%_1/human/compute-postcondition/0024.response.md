Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `a` is equal to `l[x]`, `b` is the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, `c` is 0, `y` is less than `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is `y + 1`. Either `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`. The current value of `l[x]` is less than `b`. The difference between `a` and `l[x]` is 0 and the difference between `b` and `l[x]` is greater than or equal to 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` has been updated to be equal to the value of `l[x]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` still contains `n` integers between 1 and `n`, and `b` is still the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer. The value of `c` is still 0, and `y` is still less than `n`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, and `x` is still `y + 1`. The conditions on `l[x]` being less than or equal to `a` or `b` are still satisfied, but now the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is 0, and the difference between `b` and `l[x]` is greater than or equal to 0.
