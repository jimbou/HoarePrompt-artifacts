Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `a` is the first integer in the list, `b` is the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, `c` is 0, `y` is less than `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is `y + 1`. Either `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`. The current value of `l[x]` is less than `a` and less than `b`. The difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`.***
