Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `x` is equal to `n`, `y` is `n - 1`, and `c` is 0. Either `a` is equal to `l[x]` and `b` is either 0 or the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or `a` is the first integer in the list and `b` is equal to `l[x]`. In the first case, the current value of `l[x]` is less than `b` and the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`. In the second case, the current value of `l[x]` is less than `a` and the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is greater than the difference between `b` and `l[x]`.**
