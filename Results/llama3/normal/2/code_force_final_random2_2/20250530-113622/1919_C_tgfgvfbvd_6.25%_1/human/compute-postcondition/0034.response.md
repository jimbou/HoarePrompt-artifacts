Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is less than `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is `y + 1`. Either `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`. `a` is either the first integer in the list or equal to `l[x]`, and `b` is either the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer or equal to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is equal to `l[x]` if `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, otherwise `b` is equal to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is updated to be equal to `l[x]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, otherwise `b` is updated to be equal to `l[x]`.***
