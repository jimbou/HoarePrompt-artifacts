Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `x` is equal to `n`, `y` is `n - 1`, and `c` is 0. Either `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then either `a` is equal to `l[x]` and `b` is either 0 or the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or `a` is the first integer in the list and `b` is equal to `l[x]`. In the first case, the current value of `l[x]` is less than `b` and the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`. In the second case, the current value of `l[x]` is less than `a` and the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is greater than the difference between `b` and `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then either `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `a` is equal to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `l[x]` and `b` is the integer at index `x` in the list.***
