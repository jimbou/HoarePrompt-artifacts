Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 2, l is a list of n integers between 1 and n, a is the first integer in the list, x is equal to the original value of n, y is 3, and c is 0. If the integer at index 3 in the list is greater than the integer at index 2 in the list, then b is the integer at index 3 in the list. Otherwise, b is not changed.***
