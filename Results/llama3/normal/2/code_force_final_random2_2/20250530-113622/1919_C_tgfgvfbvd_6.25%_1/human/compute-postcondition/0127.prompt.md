Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, l is a list of n integers between 1 and n, y is equal to n, x is equal to n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, a is the first integer in the list. If there exists an integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, b is equal to the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, otherwise b is 0. c is 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
        if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
        c += 1
    elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
        if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    elif a >= l[x]:
        a = l[x]
    else:
        b = l[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is equal to `n - 1`, `x` is equal to `n`. `c` is 1 if `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `l[x]` is greater than `b`, otherwise `c` is 0. If `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `l[x]` is greater than `b`, then if the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`, `a` is equal to `l[x]`, `b` is equal to the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or 0 if no such integer exists. Otherwise, `a` is the first integer in the list, `b` is equal to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, then if `l[x]` is less than `a` and `l[x]` is less than `b`, if the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, `a` is equal to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is equal to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `b`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, `a` is equal to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is equal to `l[x]` and `a` is less than `l[x]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is equal to `n`, `x` is equal to `n + 1`. `c` is 2 if `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `l[x]` is greater than `b`, otherwise `c` is 1. If `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `l[x]` is greater than `b`, then if the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`, `a` is equal to `l[x]`, `b` is equal to the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or 0 if no such integer exists. Otherwise, `a` is the first integer in the list, `b` is equal to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, then if `l[x]` is less than `a` and `l[x]` is less than `b`, if the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, `a` is equal to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is equal to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `b`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, `a` is equal to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is equal to `l[x]` and `a` is less than `l[x]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is greater than `n + 1`, `x` is equal to `n + 2`. `c` is either 3 if `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `l[x]` is greater than `b`, otherwise 2. If `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `l[x]` is greater than `b`, then if the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`, `a` is equal to `l[x]` and `b` is either the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or 0 if no such integer exists. Otherwise, `b` is equal to `l[x]` and `a` is either equal to `l[x]`, the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or 0 if no such integer exists, or the first integer in the list, or less than `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, then if `l[x]` is less than `a` and `l[x]` is less than `b`, if the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, `a` is equal to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is equal to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `b`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, `a` is equal to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is equal to `l[x]` and `a` is less than `l[x]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
