Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `a` is the value of `l[x]`, `b` is the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, `c` is 0, `y` is less than `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is `y + 1`. The current value of `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`. Additionally, the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to be the value of `l[x]`, which is greater than both the original value of `a` and `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. The difference between `l[x]` and the new value of `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`, as per the initial condition.
