Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `a` is the first integer in the list, `x` is equal to the original value of `n`, and `y` is 1. If the second integer in the list is greater than the first integer, then `b` is set to the value of the second integer and `c` remains 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `b` and `c`.***
