To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n`. 

Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, but this does not guarantee that the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 1.

Additionally, since `y` is the loop variable, its initial value should be the starting point of the range, which is 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of n integers between 1 and n, `a` is the first integer in the list, `b` is 0, `c` is 0, `y` is 1, `x` is equal to the original value of `n`**
