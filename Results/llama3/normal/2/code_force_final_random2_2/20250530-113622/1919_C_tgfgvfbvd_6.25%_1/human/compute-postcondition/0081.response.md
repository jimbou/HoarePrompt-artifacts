Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is equal to `n - 1`, `x` is equal to `n`, `a` is equal to `l[x]`, `b` is equal to the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or 0 if no such integer exists, `c` is 0, `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `l[x]` is greater than `b`, the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` has been updated to be equal to the value of `l[x]`, which is the current value of the list at index `x`. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` still contains `n` integers between 1 and `n`, and `x` and `y` are still equal to `n` and `n-1` respectively. The value of `b` is still the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or 0 if no such integer exists, and `c` is still 0. The relationship between `l[x]`, `a`, and `b` is still maintained, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
