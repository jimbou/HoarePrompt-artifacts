Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is less than `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is `y + 1`. `a` and `b` are updated based on the value of `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, `c` is increased by 1 and either `a` or `b` is updated to the value of `l[x]` based on the difference between `l[x]` and `a` or `b`. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then either `a` or `b` is updated to the value of `l[x]` based on whether `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b` or not, and the difference between `l[x]` and `a` or `b`.***
