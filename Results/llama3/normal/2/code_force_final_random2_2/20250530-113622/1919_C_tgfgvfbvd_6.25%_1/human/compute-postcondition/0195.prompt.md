Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = l[0]
    b = 0
    c = 0
    y = 0
    for y in range(1, n):
        if l[y] > l[y - 1]:
            b = l[y]
            break
    for x in range(y + 1, n):
        if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
            if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
                a = l[x]
            else:
                b = l[x]
            c += 1
        elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
            if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
                a = l[x]
            else:
                b = l[x]
        elif a >= l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    print(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, l is a list of n integers between 1 and n, y is equal to n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is equal to n. Either a is the smallest integer in the list and b is the largest integer in the list, or a is the largest integer in the list and b is the smallest integer in the list. c is equal to the number of times an integer in the list is greater than both a and b, and the number of times an integer in the list is greater than both a and b is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is equal to `n`, `x` is equal to `n`, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 0. If there exists an integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, `a` is equal to the maximum integer in the list, `b` is equal to the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or 0 if no such integer exists. Otherwise, `a` is equal to the first integer in the list, `b` is equal to 0., and the value of `c` which is an integer greater than or equal to 0 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `x` is equal to `n`, `y` is `n - 1`, `c` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or `n - 1`. `a` is either the maximum integer in the list `l` or the first integer in the list `l` that is greater than the previous integer and is less than the maximum integer in the list `l`. `b` is either the maximum integer in the list `l` or the first integer in the list `l` that is greater than the previous integer and is less than the maximum integer in the list `l`, and the value of `c` which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or `n - 1` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
