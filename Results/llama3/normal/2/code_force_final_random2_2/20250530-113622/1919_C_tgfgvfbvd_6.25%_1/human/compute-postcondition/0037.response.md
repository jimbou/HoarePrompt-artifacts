Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is `y + 2`, `a` is `l[x]`, `b` is updated based on the value of `l[x]`, `c` is increased by 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`**.

In this output state, the value of `a` is updated to be equal to the value of `l[x]`, where `x` is `y + 2`. The value of `b` is updated based on the value of `l[x]`, but its exact value is not specified. The value of `c` is increased by 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`. The values of `n`, `l`, `y`, `stdin`, and `x` remain unchanged.
