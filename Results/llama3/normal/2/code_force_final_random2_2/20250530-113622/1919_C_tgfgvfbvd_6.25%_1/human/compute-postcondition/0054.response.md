Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is less than `n - 2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is `y + 3`, `a` is equal to `l[y + 3]`, `b` is updated based on the value of `l[x]`, and `c` is increased by 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to be equal to the value of `l[x]`, which is the element at index `x` in the list `l`. The value of `x` is still `y + 3`, and the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
