Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `x` is equal to `n`, `y` is `n - 1`, and `c` is 0. If the difference between `l[x]` and the first integer in the list `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`. In both cases, `l[x]` is greater than `a` and greater than `b`.***
