To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. Since `y` is initialized to 1, we need to adjust `y` to be 1 and `n` to be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of n integers between 1 and n, `y` is 1, `x` is equal to n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `a` is the first integer in the list, `b` is 0, `c` is 0**
