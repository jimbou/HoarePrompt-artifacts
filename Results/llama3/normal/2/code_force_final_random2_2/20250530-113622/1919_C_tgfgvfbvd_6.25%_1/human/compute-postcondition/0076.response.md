Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 3, l is a list of n integers between 1 and n, y is 3, x is equal to n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, a is the first integer in the list. If the fourth integer in the list is greater than the third integer, b is equal to the fourth integer in the list. Otherwise, if the second integer in the list is greater than the first integer, b is equal to the second integer in the list, otherwise b is 0. c is 0.***
