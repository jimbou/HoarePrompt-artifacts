Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is equal to `n - 1`, `x` is equal to `n`, `a` is the first integer in the list, `b` is equal to `l[x]`, `c` is 0, `l[x]` is greater than `a`, `l[x]` is greater than `b`, the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is less than the difference between `l[x]` and `b`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `b` has been updated to be equal to the value of `l[x]`. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` still contains `n` integers between 1 and `n`, and `x` and `y` are still equal to `n` and `n-1` respectively. The first integer in the list is still `a`, and `c` is still 0. The relationship between `l[x]`, `a`, and `b` has changed, as `b` is now equal to `l[x]`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
