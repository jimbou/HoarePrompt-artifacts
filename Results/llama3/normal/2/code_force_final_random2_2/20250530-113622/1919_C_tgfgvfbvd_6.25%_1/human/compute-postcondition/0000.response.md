To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`. 

For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be at least 1, because the loop will not execute if `int(input())` is 0. 

State: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), _ is 0, int(input()) must be at least 1**
