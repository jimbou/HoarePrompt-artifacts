Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is equal to `n`, `x` is equal to `n + 1`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `a` is equal to `l[x]` and `b` is either the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or 0 if no such integer exists, or `l[x]`. If `a` is less than `l[x]`, then `a` is either the first integer in the list, or `l[x]`, or the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or 0 if no such integer exists, and `b` is equal to `l[x]`. `c` is 1 if `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `l[x]` is greater than `b`, otherwise `c` is 0.***
