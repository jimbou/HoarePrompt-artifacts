Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is greater than `n + 1`, `x` is equal to `n + 2`. `c` is 2 if `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `l[x]` is greater than `b`, otherwise `c` is 1. If the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, then `a` is equal to `l[x]` and `b` is either the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or 0 if no such integer exists. Otherwise, `b` is equal to `l[x]` and `a` is either equal to `l[x]` or less than `l[x]`.**
