Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `a` is the first integer in the list, `b` is equal to `l[x]`, `c` is 0, `y` is less than `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is `y + 1`. Either `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`. The current value of `l[x]` is less than `a` and less than the previous value of `b`. Additionally, `a - l[x]` is greater than the previous value of `b - l[x]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `b` has been updated to be equal to the value of `l[x]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` and the values of `a`, `c`, `y`, `x`, and `n` are still the same. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one. The conditions regarding the relationships between `l[x]`, `a`, and `b` have been updated to reflect the new value of `b`.
