State: **n is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 2*10^5, l is a list of n integers between 1 and n, a is the first integer in the list, y is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the current value of l[y] is greater than the current value of l[y - 1], then b is equal to the value of l[y] and c is 0. Otherwise, the values of b and c remain unchanged.**
