Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is less than `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is `y + 1`. Either `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`. `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `a` is updated to be equal to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to be equal to `l[x]`.***
