The only variables in the loop head are variables  y and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 and y is now 1. 
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2*10^5, `l` is a list of n integers between 1 and n, `a` is the first integer in the list, `b` is 0, `c` is 0, `y` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
