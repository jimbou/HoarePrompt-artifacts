Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is less than `n - 2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is `y + 3`. Either `a` is `l[y + 3]` and `b` is updated based on the value of `l[x]`, or `b` is `l[y + 3]` and `a` is updated based on the value of `l[x]`. In both cases, `c` is increased by 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`. `c` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but with `c` increased by 1. The values of `n`, `l`, `y`, `stdin`, `x`, `a`, and `b` remain the same, and the relationship between `a` and `b` based on the value of `l[x]` is still valid. The only change is that `c` is incremented by 1.
