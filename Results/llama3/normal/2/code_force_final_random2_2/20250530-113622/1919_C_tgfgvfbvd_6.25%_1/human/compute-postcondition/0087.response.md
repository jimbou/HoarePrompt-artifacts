Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is equal to `n - 1`, `x` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `a` is the first integer in the list, `b` is equal to the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or 0 if no such integer exists, `c` is 0. Either `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`. The current value of `l[x]` is less than `a` and also less than `b`***
