Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is greater than `n + 1`, `x` is equal to `n + 2`, `c` is 2 if `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `l[x]` is greater than `b`, otherwise `c` is 1, `b` is equal to `l[x]`, `a` is either equal to `l[x]` or the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or 0 if no such integer exists, or the first integer in the list, or less than `l[x]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, it is still an integer greater than or equal to 3. The list `l` also remains the same, it is still a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`. The value of `y` is still greater than `n + 1`. The value of `x` is still equal to `n + 2`. The value of `c` depends on the values of `l[x]`, `a`, and `b`, it is either 2 or 1. The value of `b` is now equal to `l[x]`. The value of `a` is either equal to `l[x]`, the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or 0 if no such integer exists, or the first integer in the list, or less than `l[x]`.
