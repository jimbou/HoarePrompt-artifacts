Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2*10^5, `l` is a list of n integers between 1 and n, `a` is the first integer in the list, `b` is 0, `c` is 0, `y` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The current value of `l[y]` is greater than the current value of `l[y - 1]`***
