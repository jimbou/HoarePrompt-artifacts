Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is `y + 2`, `a` is either updated or not, `b` is equal to `l[x]`, `c` is either increased by 1 or not.**

In this output state, the value of `b` is updated to be equal to the value of `l[x]`, where `x` is `y + 2`. The values of `n`, `l`, `y`, `stdin`, and `x` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `a` may or may not be updated, depending on the previous values of `a` and `l[x]`. The value of `c` may or may not be increased by 1, depending on whether `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`.
