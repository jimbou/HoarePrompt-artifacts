Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `y` is equal to `n`, `x` is equal to `n + 1`, `a` is equal to `l[n+1]`, `b` is equal to the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or 0 if no such integer exists, `c` is 1 if `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `l[x]` is greater than `b`, otherwise `c` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to be equal to `l[n+1]`, which is the integer at index `n+1` in the list `l`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
