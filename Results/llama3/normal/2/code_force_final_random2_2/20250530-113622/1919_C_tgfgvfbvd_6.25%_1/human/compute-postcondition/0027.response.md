Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `a` is either the first integer in the list or equal to `l[x]`, `b` is either the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer or equal to `l[x]`, `c` is 0, `y` is less than `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is `y + 1`. Either `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`. If `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, then `a` is equal to `l[x]` and the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is 0 and the difference between `b` and `l[x]` is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, `b` is equal to `l[x]` and `a - l[x]` is greater than the previous value of `b - l[x]`.***
