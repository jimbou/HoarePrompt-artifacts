Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `a` is the first integer in the list, `b` is `l[x]`, `c` is 0, `y` is less than `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is `y + 1`. The current value of `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and the previous value of `b`, and `l[x] - a` is less than `l[x] - b`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to `l[x]`, which is the current value of the list at index `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions that `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and the previous value of `b`, and `l[x] - a` is less than `l[x] - b` are still valid.
