Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array into two subsequences. The program iterates through the array, maintaining two variables `a` and `b` to store the maximum values of the two subsequences. It also keeps track of the number of times a new maximum value is found, which contributes to the penalty.

The program handles all possible cases, including:

* When the array is already sorted in ascending or descending order, the penalty is 0.
* When the array has a mix of increasing and decreasing subsequences, the program correctly identifies the maximum values of the two subsequences and calculates the penalty.
* When the array has duplicate values, the program handles it correctly by updating the maximum values of the subsequences accordingly.

The program also handles edge cases, such as when the array has only one element, in which case the penalty is 0.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible penalty, and it handles all possible cases and edge cases correctly.
