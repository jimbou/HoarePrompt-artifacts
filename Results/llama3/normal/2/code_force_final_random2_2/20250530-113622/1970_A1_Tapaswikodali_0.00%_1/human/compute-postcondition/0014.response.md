Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000 and must have at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in the string, `i` is 2. If `char` is "(", then `balance` is 4 and `details` is a list containing three tuples with the current balance, the negative of the current index, and the current character. If `char` is ")", then `balance` is 0 and `details` is a list containing three tuples with the current balance, the negative of the current index, and the current character.**

In this output state, the value of `balance` has been incremented by 1. If `char` is "(", the initial value of `balance` was 3, so it is now 4. If `char` is ")", the initial value of `balance` was -1, so it is now 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
