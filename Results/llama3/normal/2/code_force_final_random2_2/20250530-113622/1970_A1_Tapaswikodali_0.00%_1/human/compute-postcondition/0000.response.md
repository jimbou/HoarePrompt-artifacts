Output State: **stdin is empty, s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, balance is 0, details is an empty list**

The code snippet reads a balanced parentheses sequence from stdin and assigns it to the variable `s`. The length of the sequence does not exceed 500,000. After the code executes, stdin is empty because the input has been read. The variable `s` now holds the input string. The variable `balance` is initialized to 0, and the variable `details` is initialized as an empty list.
