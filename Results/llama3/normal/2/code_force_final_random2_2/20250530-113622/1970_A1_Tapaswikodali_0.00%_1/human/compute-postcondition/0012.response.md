Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000 and must have at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in the string, `i` is 1. If `char` is "(", then `balance` is 3 and `details` is a list containing three tuples with the current balance, the negative of the current index, and the current character. If `char` is ")", then `balance` is -1 and `details` is a list containing three tuples with the current balance, the negative of the current index, and the current character.**

In natural language, the output state is that the string `s` remains unchanged, the character `char` is still the second character in the string, and the index `i` is still 1. The balance and details have been updated based on the value of `char`. If `char` is an opening parenthesis, the balance is 3 and the details list now contains three tuples. If `char` is a closing parenthesis, the balance is -1 and the details list also contains three tuples.
