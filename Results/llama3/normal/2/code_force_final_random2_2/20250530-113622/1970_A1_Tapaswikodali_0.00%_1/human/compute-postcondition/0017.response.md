Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000 and must have at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in the string, `i` is 2. If `char` is "(", then `balance` is 4 and `details` is a list containing four tuples with the current balance, the negative of the current index, and the current character. If `char` is ")", then `balance` is 0 and `details` is a list containing four tuples with the current balance, the negative of the current index, and the current character. If `char` is "(", then `balance` is 2 and `details` is a list containing four tuples with the current balance, the negative of the current index, and the current character. If `char` is ")", then `balance` is -2 and `details` is a list containing four tuples with the current balance, the negative of the current index, and the current character.**

The code appends a tuple containing the current balance, the negative of the current index, and the current character to the `details` list. The values of the other variables are not affected. The `details` list now contains four tuples, with the newly added tuple being the last one.
