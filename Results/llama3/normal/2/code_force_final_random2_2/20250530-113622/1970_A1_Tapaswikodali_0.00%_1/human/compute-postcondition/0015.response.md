Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000 and must have at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in the string, `i` is 2. If `char` is "(", then `balance` is 2 and `details` is a list containing three tuples with the current balance, the negative of the current index, and the current character. If `char` is ")", then `balance` is -2 and `details` is a list containing three tuples with the current balance, the negative of the current index, and the current character.**

In this output state, the value of `balance` has been decremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `balance` is now either 2 or -2, depending on the value of `char`. The rest of the variables, including `s`, `char`, `i`, and `details`, retain their initial values.
