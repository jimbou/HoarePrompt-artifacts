The function reads a non-empty string of balanced parentheses from standard input, sorts the string based on the balance of parentheses at each position, and prints the sorted string. The function does not modify the input string or its balance, but rather rearranges the characters to maintain the original balance while sorting. The output is the original string, which is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
