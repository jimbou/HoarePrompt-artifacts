Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin is empty, s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, balance is 0, details is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for i, char in enumerate(s):
    if char == '(':
        balance += 1
    else:
        balance -= 1
    details.append((balance, -i, char))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000 and must have at least 1 character, `char` is the first character in the string, `i` is 0, if `char` is "(", then `balance` is 1, otherwise `balance` is -1, and `details` is a list containing one tuple with the current balance, the negative of the current index, and the current character.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000 and must have at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in the string, `i` is 1. If `char` is "(", then `balance` is 3 and `details` is a list containing three tuples with the current balance, the negative of the current index, and the current character. If `char` is ")", then `balance` is -1 and `details` is a list containing three tuples with the current balance, the negative of the current index, and the current character.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000 and must have at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in the string, `i` is 2. If `char` is "(", then `balance` is 4 and `details` is a list containing four tuples with the current balance, the negative of the current index, and the current character. If `char` is ")", then `balance` is 0 and `details` is a list containing four tuples with the current balance, the negative of the current index, and the current character. If `char` is "(", then `balance` is 2 and `details` is a list containing four tuples with the current balance, the negative of the current index, and the current character. If `char` is ")", then `balance` is -2 and `details` is a list containing four tuples with the current balance, the negative of the current index, and the current character.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
