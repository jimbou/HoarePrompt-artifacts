Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000 and must have at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in the string, `i` is 1, if `char` is "(", then `balance` is 1, otherwise `balance` is -1, and `details` is a list containing two tuples with the current balance, the negative of the current index, and the current character.**

The value of `balance` is decremented by 1. If `char` is "(", then `balance` was 2 and is now 1. If `char` is ")", then `balance` was 0 and is now -1. The values of the other variables are not affected.
