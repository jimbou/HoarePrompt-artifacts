Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000 and must have at least 1 character, `char` is the first character in the string, `i` is 0, if `char` is "(", then `balance` is 1, otherwise `balance` is -1, and `details` is a list containing one tuple with the current balance, the negative of the current index, and the current character.**

In this output state, the `details` list now contains a tuple with the current balance, the negative of the current index, and the current character. The other variables remain unchanged. The `details` list now contains one element, which is a tuple containing the current balance, the negative of the current index (which is 0), and the current character (which is the first character in the string `s`).
