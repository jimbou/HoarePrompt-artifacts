Output State: **stdin is empty, s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000 and must have at least 1 character, char is the first character in the string which is ")", i is 0, balance is -1, details is an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `balance` has been updated to -1 because the code `balance -= 1` decrements the value of `balance` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
