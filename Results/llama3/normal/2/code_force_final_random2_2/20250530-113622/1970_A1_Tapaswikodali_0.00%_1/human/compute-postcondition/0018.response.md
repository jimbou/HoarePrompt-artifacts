Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `char` is the last character in the string, `i` is the length of the string minus 1, `balance` is 0, and `details` is a list containing tuples with the balance, the negative of the index, and the character at each index.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations, the output state will have the same string `s` as the initial state, but the variable `char` will hold the last character of the string, and the variable `i` will hold the length of the string minus 1. The `balance` will be 0 because the string is a balanced parentheses sequence. The `details` list will contain tuples for each character in the string, where each tuple contains the balance at that index, the negative of the index, and the character at that index.
