According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If the string has at least 3 characters the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in the string, `i` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string must have at least 3 characters and the index is 2 and `char` is the third character in the string.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000 and must have at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in the string, `i` is 2. If `char` is "(", then `balance` is 3 and `details` is a list containing three tuples with the current balance, the negative of the current index, and the current character. If `char` is ")", then `balance` is -1 and `details` is a list containing three tuples with the current balance, the negative of the current index, and the current character.**
