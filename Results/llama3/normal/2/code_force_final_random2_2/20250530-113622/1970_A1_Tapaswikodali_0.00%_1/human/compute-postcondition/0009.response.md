Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000 and must have at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in the string, `i` is 1, if `char` is "(", then `balance` is 3, otherwise `balance` is 1, and `details` is a list containing two tuples with the current balance, the negative of the current index, and the current character.**

In this output state, the value of `balance` has been incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `balance` now depends on the value of `char`: if `char` is "(", then `balance` is 3; otherwise, `balance` is 1. The rest of the variables, including `s`, `char`, `i`, and `details`, retain their initial values.
