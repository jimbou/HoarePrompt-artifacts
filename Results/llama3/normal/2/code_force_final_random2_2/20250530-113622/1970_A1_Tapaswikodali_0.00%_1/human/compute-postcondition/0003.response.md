Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000 and must have at least 1 character, `char` is the first character in the string and is equal to "(", `i` is 0, `balance` is 1, `details` is an empty list**

The code increments the value of `balance` by 1. Since the initial value of `balance` is 0, its new value is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The string `s` is still a balanced parentheses sequence with the same length, and `char` is still the first character of the string, which is "(". The index `i` is still 0, and the list `details` is still empty.
