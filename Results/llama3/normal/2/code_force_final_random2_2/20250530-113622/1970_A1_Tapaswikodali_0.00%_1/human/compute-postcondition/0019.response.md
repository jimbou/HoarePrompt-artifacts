Output State: **s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, char is the last character in the string, i is the length of the string minus 1, balance is 0, details is a sorted list containing tuples with the balance, the negative of the index, and the character at each index, and result is a string containing the characters from details in the sorted order of their balance and index.**

The code sorts the `details` list in ascending order based on the balance and the negative of the index. This means that the tuples in `details` are rearranged so that the ones with the smallest balance come first, and for tuples with the same balance, the ones with the smallest negative index (i.e., the largest index) come first.

After sorting `details`, the code creates a new string `result` by concatenating the characters from the tuples in `details`, in the order they appear in the sorted list. This means that `result` contains the characters from the original string `s`, but in a different order.

The values of `s`, `char`, `i`, and `balance` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The only changes are to the `details` list, which is sorted, and the new string `result`, which is created from the sorted `details`.
