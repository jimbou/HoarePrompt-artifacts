The code prints a formatted string containing the values of `h`, `m`, and `day`. The `h` and `m` are integers representing the hour and minute, respectively. The `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', depending on the value of `h`.

If `h` is 0, it is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` is greater than 12, `day` is 'PM' and `h` is decreased by 12. If `h` is 12, `day` is 'PM', otherwise `day` remains 'AM'.

The `:02d` in the print statement is a format specifier that pads the value with leading zeros if necessary, to make it at least 2 digits wide.

Output: **[h]:[m] [day] (where [h] is the hour, [m] is the minute, and [day] is either 'AM' or 'PM', depending on the value of [h])**
