Postcondition: ***`day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` is an integer between 3 and 1440, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59, `h` is an integer between 0 and 23, stdin is empty, `_` is 2. If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is decreased by 12. Otherwise, if `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM', otherwise `day` remains 'AM'.***
