Output State: **day is 'AM', n is an integer between 1 and 1440, stdin is empty**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the string 'AM' to the variable day. The second line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to the variable n. Since stdin contains a valid input, which is an integer between 1 and 1440, followed by a string of length 5 in the format hh:mm, the integer is successfully read and assigned to n. After the execution of the code, stdin is empty because the integer has been read. The variable day remains unchanged, and its value is still 'AM'. The variable n now holds the integer value read from stdin, which is between 1 and 1440.
