Output State: **day is 'PM', n is an integer between 3 and 1440, m is an integer between 0 and 59, h is an integer between -12 and 11, stdin is empty, _ is 2**

The code modifies the values of `day` and `h`. The first line subtracts 12 from the value of `h`, which was initially between 0 and 23. This means that `h` will now be between -12 and 11. The second line assigns the value 'PM' to `day`, which was initially either 'AM' or 'PM'. The values of `n`, `m`, and `_` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code. The stdin remains empty, as there are no input operations in the code.
