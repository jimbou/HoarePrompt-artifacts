Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly converts 24-hour time to 12-hour time. It handles all possible cases, including:

*   When the hour is 0, it sets the hour to 12 and the day to 'AM'.
*   When the hour is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from the hour and sets the day to 'PM'.
*   When the hour is 12, it sets the day to 'PM'.
*   When the hour is less than 12, it sets the day to 'AM'.

The program also correctly handles the minutes, as they remain the same in both 24-hour and 12-hour time.

The program uses the `:02d` format specifier to ensure that the hour and minute are always displayed with two digits, padding with zeros if necessary.

Overall, the program correctly implements the conversion from 24-hour time to 12-hour time and handles all possible cases.
