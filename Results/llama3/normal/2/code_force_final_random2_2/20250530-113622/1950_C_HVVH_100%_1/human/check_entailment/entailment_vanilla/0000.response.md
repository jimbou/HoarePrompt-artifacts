Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to convert a time in 24-hour format to its equivalent in 12-hour format. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program starts by defining a function `func()` that will handle the conversion.

2. Inside the function, it first sets the variable `day` to `'AM'`, which will be used to determine whether the time is in the morning or afternoon.

3. It then reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.

4. The program then enters a loop that will run `n` times. In each iteration, it reads a time in 24-hour format from the input, splits it into hours `h` and minutes `m`, and converts them to integers.

5. If the hour `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and `day` to `'AM'`, because 00:00 in 24-hour format is equivalent to 12:00 AM in 12-hour format.

6. If the hour `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to `'PM'`, because hours 13-23 in 24-hour format correspond to hours 1-11 in the afternoon in 12-hour format.

7. If the hour `h` is not 0 and not greater than 12, it sets `day` to `'AM'`. However, if `h` is exactly 12, it sets `day` to `'PM'`, because 12:00 in 24-hour format is equivalent to 12:00 PM in 12-hour format.

8. Finally, the program prints the converted time in 12-hour format, with the hour `h` and minute `m` formatted as two digits with leading zeros if necessary, followed by the `day` indicator.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly handles all possible cases for converting a time in 24-hour format to its equivalent in 12-hour format.

Correctness: **True**
