The code prints a formatted string containing the values of `h`, `m`, and `day`. The value of `h` is an integer between 1 and 12, which is either the original value of `h` if it's between 1 and 12, or the result of decreasing the original value of `h` by 12 if it's greater than 12, or 12 if the original value of `h` is 0. The value of `m` is an integer between 0 and 59. The value of `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', depending on the original value of `h`. If `h` is 0, `day` is 'AM', if `h` is 12, `day` is 'PM', otherwise `day` remains 'AM'.

Output: **hh:mm (where hh is the value of h and mm is the value of m) AM/PM (where AM/PM is the value of day)**
