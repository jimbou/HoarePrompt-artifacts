The code snippet consists of two lines that assign new values to the variables `h` and `day`. The first line sets `h` to 12, overwriting its initial value of 0. The second line sets `day` to 'AM', which is the same as its initial value, so this line does not change the value of `day`.

Output State: **h is 12, day is 'AM', n is an integer between 1 and 1440, m is an integer, stdin is empty, _ is 0**
