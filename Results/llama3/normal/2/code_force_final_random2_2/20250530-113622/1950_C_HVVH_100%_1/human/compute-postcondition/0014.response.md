Postcondition: ***`day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` is an integer between 1 and 1440, `h` and `m` are integers, stdin is empty, `_` is 0. If `h` is 0, then `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` is greater than 12, then `day` is 'PM' and `h` is decreased by 12. If `h` is 12, then `day` is 'PM', otherwise `day` remains 'AM'.***
