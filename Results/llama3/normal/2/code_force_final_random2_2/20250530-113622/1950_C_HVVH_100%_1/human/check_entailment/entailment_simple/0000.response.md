Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly converts the 24-hour time format to the 12-hour time format. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

- If the hour is 0, it sets the hour to 12 and the day to 'AM'. This is correct because 00:00 in 24-hour format is equivalent to 12:00 AM in 12-hour format.

- If the hour is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from the hour and sets the day to 'PM'. This is correct because, for example, 13:00 in 24-hour format is equivalent to 01:00 PM in 12-hour format.

- If the hour is less than or equal to 12, it sets the day to 'AM' unless the hour is exactly 12, in which case it sets the day to 'PM'. This is correct because, for example, 11:00 in 24-hour format is equivalent to 11:00 AM in 12-hour format, but 12:00 in 24-hour format is equivalent to 12:00 PM in 12-hour format.

- The program then prints the hour and minute in the format 'hh:mm' followed by the day ('AM' or 'PM'). The `:02d` in the print statement ensures that the hour and minute are always displayed with two digits, padding with zeros if necessary.

Correctness: **True**
