The value of `day` is changed to 'PM'. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin is still empty. Therefore, the Output State is: `day` is 'PM', `n` is an integer between 3 and 1440, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59, `h` is an integer between 0 and 23, stdin is empty, `_` is 2.
