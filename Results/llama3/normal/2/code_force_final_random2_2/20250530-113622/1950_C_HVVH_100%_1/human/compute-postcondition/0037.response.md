The `print` statement will print a formatted string containing the values of `h`, `m`, and `day`. 

The value of `h` is an integer between 0 and 23, but it is adjusted based on the initial value of `h`. If `h` is 0, it is set to 12 and `day` is set to 'AM'. If `h` is greater than 12, it is decreased by 12. If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM', otherwise `day` remains 'AM'. 

The value of `m` is an integer between 0 and 59.

The `:02d` format specifier is used to format the values of `h` and `m` as two-digit numbers, padding with zeros if necessary.

The value of `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', depending on the initial value of `h`.

Output: **hh:mm (where hh is the adjusted value of h and mm is the value of m, both formatted as two-digit numbers, and day is either 'AM' or 'PM')**
