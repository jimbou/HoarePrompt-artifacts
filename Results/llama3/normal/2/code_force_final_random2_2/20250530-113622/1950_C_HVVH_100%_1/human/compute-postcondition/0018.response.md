Output State: **`day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` is an integer between 2 and 1440, `h` is an integer between 0 and 23, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59, stdin is empty, `_` is 1**

The code assigns the values of `h` and `m` from the input, where `input().split(':')` accepts a time in the format 'HH:MM' and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The values of `day` and `n` are not affected. The stdin is empty after the input is read. The value of `_` remains unchanged.
