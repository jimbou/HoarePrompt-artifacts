Output: **`day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` is an integer between 3 and 1440, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59, `h` is an integer between 0 and 23, stdin is empty, `_` is 2. If `h` is 0, `day` is 'AM' and `h` is 12. If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is decreased by 12. If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM', otherwise `day` remains 'AM'. The time in 12-hour format is printed, where hours are between 01 and 12 and minutes are between 00 and 59, and the day is either 'AM' or 'PM'.**
