The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1440. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` is an integer between 2 and 1440, `h` and `m` are integers, stdin is empty, `_` is 1**
