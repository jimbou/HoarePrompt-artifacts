Output State: **`day` is 'AM', `n` is an integer between 1 and 1440, `h` and `m` are integers, stdin is empty, `_` is 0**

In this output state, the values of `day`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged. The stdin is empty because it was empty initially and no input was provided. The variables `h` and `m` are assigned integer values from the input, which is split by the colon (`:`) character. Since the input is not provided, the exact values of `h` and `m` cannot be determined, but they are integers.
