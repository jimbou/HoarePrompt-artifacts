Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 3, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `z` is the number of '0's in `s` plus one, `zero` is 2, `one` is 0, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil((z+1) * 100 / (i + 1))`, and `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. If `s[i]` is '1', then `o` is the number of '1's in `s` plus one, `zero` is 1, `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, and `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. In both cases, `lst` is a list containing the value `i + 1` if `zero_perc` >= 50 and `one_perc` >= 50, otherwise `lst` is an empty list. Additionally, `ele` is undefined, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele` and `n // 2` if `n` is even or `(n-1)/2` if `n` is odd, `pk` is an integer equal to `n // 2` if `n` is even or `(n-1)/2` if `n` is odd, `t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `i` is 3, `c1` is less than 50, and `final` is a list containing the value `n`. If `zero_perc` >= 50 and `one_perc` >= 50, then `lst` contains the value `i + 1`, otherwise `lst` is an empty list.***
