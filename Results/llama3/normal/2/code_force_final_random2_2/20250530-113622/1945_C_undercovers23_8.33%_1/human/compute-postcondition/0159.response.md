Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` is math.ceil(`zero` * 100 / `n`), `one_perc` is math.ceil((`o` - `one`) * 100 / (`n` - `n` + 1)), `lst` is a list containing at least two values `i` + 1 if `zero_perc` >= 50 and `one_perc` >= 50 for all `i` in range(`n` - 1), `ele` is the second element in the list `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele` and `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n`-1)/2 if `n` is odd, `pk` is an integer equal to `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n`-1)/2 if `n` is odd, `t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `i` is `n` - 1, `c1` is less than 50, and `final` is a list containing the value `n`. The value of `mini` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being the updated value of `mini`, which is now the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. All other variables remain unchanged.
