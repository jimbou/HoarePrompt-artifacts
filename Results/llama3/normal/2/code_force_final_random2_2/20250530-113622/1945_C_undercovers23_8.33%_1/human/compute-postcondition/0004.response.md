Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is an even integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer between 1 and 1.5*10^5, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains a positive integer, `_` remains 0, `n` remains an even integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `s` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, and a new variable `pk` is introduced which is half of `n`, i.e., an integer between 1 and 1.5*10^5. The number of test cases in stdin remains the same, minus two test cases.
