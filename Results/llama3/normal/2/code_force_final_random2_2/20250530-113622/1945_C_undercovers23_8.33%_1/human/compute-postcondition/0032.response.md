Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 and greater than 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s` plus 1 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it remains the same, `z` is the number of '0's in `s` plus 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `zero` is 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', otherwise it is 0, `one` is 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '1', otherwise it is 0, `lst` is a list containing the integers 1 and 3 if both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, otherwise it is a list containing the integer 1, `mini` is 10^8, if `n` is even, `pk` is an integer between 1 and 1.5*10^5, if `n` is odd, `pk` is an integer equal to `(n-1)/2`, `i` is 2, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, and `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))` if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o + 1 - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.***
