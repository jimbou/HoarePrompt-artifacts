Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` is math.ceil(`zero` * 100 / `n`), `one_perc` is math.ceil((`o` - `one`) * 100 / (`n` - `n` + 1)), `lst` is a list containing values `i` + 1 if `zero_perc` >= 50 and `one_perc` >= 50 for all `i` in range(`n` - 1), `ele` is the last element in the list `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst` and `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n`-1)/2 if `n` is odd, `pk` is an integer equal to `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n`-1)/2 if `n` is odd, `t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `i` is `n` - 1, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, `elem` is the last element in the list `lst`, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in `lst` that have an absolute difference with `pk` equal to the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst` and `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n`-1)/2 if `n` is odd.**

In this output state, the value of `c1` has been updated to `o * 100 // n`, which is the percentage of '1's in the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
