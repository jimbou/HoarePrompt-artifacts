Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 and greater than 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s` and is increased by 1, `zero` is 1, `one` is 0, `lst` is a list containing the integer 1 if both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, otherwise it is an empty list, `mini` is 10^8, if `n` is even, `pk` is an integer between 1 and 1.5*10^5, if `n` is odd, `pk` is an integer equal to `(n-1)/2`, `i` is 1, the current value of `zero_perc` is 100, and the current value of `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))**
