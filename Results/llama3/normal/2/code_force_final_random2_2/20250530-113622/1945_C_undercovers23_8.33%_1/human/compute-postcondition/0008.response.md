Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 0, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the number of '1's in s, z is the number of '0's in s, zero is 0, one is 0, lst is an empty list, mini is 10^8, and if n is even, pk is an integer between 1 and 1.5*10^5, if n is odd, pk is an integer equal to (n-1)/2.**

The code initializes several variables and data structures without modifying the initial state's variables. The variable `sl` is created as a list of characters in the string `s`, `o` is set to the count of '1's in `s`, and `z` is set to the count of '0's in `s`. Two variables, `zero` and `one`, are initialized to 0, and an empty list `lst` is created. The variable `mini` is set to 10^8. The initial state's variables, including `t`, `_`, `n`, `s`, and `pk`, remain unchanged.
