Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the position of the house after which the road should be laid. It calculates the percentage of 0s and 1s in the string and finds the indices where the percentage of 0s is greater than or equal to 50% and the percentage of 1s is also greater than or equal to 50%. If such indices exist, it finds the index with the minimum absolute difference from the middle index of the string. If no such indices exist, it checks if the percentage of 1s in the entire string is greater than or equal to 50% and prints 0 if true, otherwise prints the length of the string.

Correctness: **True**
