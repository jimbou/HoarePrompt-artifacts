Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s` plus one, `zero` is 2, `one` is 0, `zero_perc` is math.ceil((`z`+1) * 100 / (`i` + 1)), and `one_perc` is math.ceil((`o` - `one`) * 100 / (`n` - `i` - 1)), `lst` is a list containing the value `i` + 1, `ele` is undefined, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele` and `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n`-1)/2 if `n` is odd, `pk` is an integer equal to `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n`-1)/2 if `n` is odd, `t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `i` is 3, `c1` is less than 50, and `final` is a list containing the value `n`.**

The code appends the value `i` + 1 to the list `lst`. Since `i` is 3, the value appended to `lst` is 4. The other variables remain unchanged.
