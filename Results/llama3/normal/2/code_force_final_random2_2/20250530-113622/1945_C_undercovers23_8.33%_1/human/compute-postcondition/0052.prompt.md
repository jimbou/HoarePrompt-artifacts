Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is a list containing the indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, `ele` is the last element in the list, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, if `n` is even, `pk` is an integer between 1 and 1.5*10^5, if `n` is odd, `pk` is an integer equal to `(n-1)/2`, `i` is `n-1`, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, and `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `final` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for elem in lst:
    if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
        final.append(elem)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is a list containing the indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50 and must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the last element in the list, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, if `n` is even, `pk` is an integer between 1 and 1.5*10^5, if `n` is odd, `pk` is an integer equal to `(n-1)/2`, `i` is `n-1`, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, and `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `final` is a list containing the first element `elem` in the list `lst` if the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element `elem` in the list `lst` is equal to `mini`, otherwise `final` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is a list containing the indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50 and must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second last element in the list, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, if `n` is even, `pk` is an integer between 1 and 1.5*10^5, if `n` is odd, `pk` is an integer equal to `(n-1)/2`, `i` is `n-1`, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, and `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `final` is a list containing the first element `elem` in the list `lst` if the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element `elem` in the list `lst` is equal to `mini`, otherwise `final` is a list containing the second element `elem` in the list `lst`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is a list containing the indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50 and must have at least 3 elements, `ele` is the last element in the list, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, if `n` is even, `pk` is an integer between 1 and 1.5*10^5, if `n` is odd, `pk` is an integer equal to `(n-1)/2`, `i` is `n-1`, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, and `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `final` is a list containing the first element `elem` in the list `lst` if the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element `elem` in the list `lst` is equal to `mini`, otherwise `final` is a list containing the second element `elem` in the list `lst`, `elem` is the last element in the list. If the absolute difference between `pk` and the last element `elem` in the list `lst` is equal to `mini`, then `final` now contains an additional element which is the last element in the list `lst`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
