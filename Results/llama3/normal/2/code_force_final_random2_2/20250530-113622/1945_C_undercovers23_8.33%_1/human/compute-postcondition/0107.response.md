The only objects in the loop head are variables  elem and lst, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the lst.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, lst has at least 1 element, elem is the last element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the elem is the second element in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in the first `n` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in the first `n` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of (`zero` * 100 / `n`), `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / 0) and is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is a list containing at least 2 integers, `ele` is the second last integer in the list, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele` and `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n-1`)/2 if `n` is odd, `final` is a list containing the first element in the list if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, otherwise `final` is an empty list, `pk` is an integer equal to `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n-1`)/2 if `n` is odd, `c1` is undefined, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, elem is the second element in the list.**
