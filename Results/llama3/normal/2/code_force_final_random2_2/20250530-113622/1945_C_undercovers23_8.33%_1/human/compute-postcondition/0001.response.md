To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, which means it is already at least 1, so we don't need to adjust it. However, we need to adjust the state of `_` to reflect that it will take on the value of the current iteration, starting from 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (3 <= n <= 3*10^5) and then a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1.**
