To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ele` and `lst`. The loop will execute if `lst` is not empty. According to the given conditions, `lst` will not be empty if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50. Therefore, we need to adjust the states to ensure these conditions are met.

State: **n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the number of '1's in s, z is the number of '0's in s, zero is the number of '0's in the first i+1 characters of s, one is the number of '1's in the first i+1 characters of s, zero_perc is the ceiling of (zero * 100 / (i + 1)) and is greater than or equal to 50, one_perc is the ceiling of ((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)) and is greater than or equal to 50, lst is a list containing the integer i + 1, ele is the integer i + 1, mini is 10^8, i is n-1, final is an empty list, pk is an integer equal to n // 2 if n is even or (n-1)/2 if n is odd, c1 is undefined, t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1**
