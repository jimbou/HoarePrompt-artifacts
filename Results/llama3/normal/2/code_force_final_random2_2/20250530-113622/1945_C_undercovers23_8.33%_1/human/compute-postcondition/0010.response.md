Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 and greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 10^8, and if `n` is even, `pk` is an integer between 1 and 1.5*10^5, if `n` is odd, `pk` is an integer equal to (n-1)/2, `i` is 0. The current value of `s[i]` is '0'.***
