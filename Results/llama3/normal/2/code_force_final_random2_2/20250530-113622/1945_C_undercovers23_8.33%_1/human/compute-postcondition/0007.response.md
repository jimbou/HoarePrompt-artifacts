Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, _ is 0, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. If n is even, pk is an integer between 1 and 1.5*10^5. If n is odd, pk is an integer equal to (n-1)/2.***
