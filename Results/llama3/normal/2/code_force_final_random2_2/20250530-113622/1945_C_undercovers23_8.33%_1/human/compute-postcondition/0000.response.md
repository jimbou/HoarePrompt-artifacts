Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (3 <= n <= 3*10^5) and then a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1.**

In this output state, the variable `t` is assigned the value of the first input from the stdin, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one test case, since one test case has been read and processed. Each remaining test case still contains two inputs: an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1.
