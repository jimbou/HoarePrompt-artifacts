Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is a list containing the indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50 and must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the last element in the list, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, if `n` is even, `pk` is an integer between 1 and 1.5*10^5, if `n` is odd, `pk` is an integer equal to `(n-1)/2`, `i` is `n-1`, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, and `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `final` is an empty list, `elem` is the first element in the list. The current value of `pk` is such that the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element `elem` in the list `lst` is equal to `mini`.**
