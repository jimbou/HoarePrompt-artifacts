The code prints the first element of the list `final`. The value of `final` depends on the value of `c1`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, then `final` is a list containing 0, indicating that there is an element in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`. Otherwise, `final` is a list containing the value `n`, indicating that there is an element in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, and `c1` is less than 50.

Output: **0 if c1 is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise n (where n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5)**
