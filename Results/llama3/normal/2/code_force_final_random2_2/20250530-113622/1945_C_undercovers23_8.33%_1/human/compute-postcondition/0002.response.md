Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 0, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**

The code reads two inputs from stdin for each test case: an integer n and a string s. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to n, and the second line assigns the string value of the input to s. The values of t and _ remain unchanged. Since one test case has been processed, stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.
