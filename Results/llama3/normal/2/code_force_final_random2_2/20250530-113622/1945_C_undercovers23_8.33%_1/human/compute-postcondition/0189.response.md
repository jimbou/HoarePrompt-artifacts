Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a string s of length n containing only 0s and 1s. For each test case, it calculates the percentage of 0s and 1s in the string and finds the indices where the percentage of 0s is greater than or equal to 50% and the percentage of 1s is also greater than or equal to 50%. If such indices exist, it finds the index with the minimum absolute difference from the middle index of the string. If no such indices exist, it checks if the percentage of 1s in the entire string is greater than or equal to 50% and prints 0 if true, otherwise prints the length of the string. The function prints the result for each test case.**
