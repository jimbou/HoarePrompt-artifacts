Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`. If `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is a list containing the value `i` + 1. Otherwise, `lst` is an empty list. Additionally, `ele` is undefined, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele` and `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n`-1)/2 if `n` is odd, `pk` is an integer equal to `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n`-1)/2 if `n` is odd, `t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `i` is 3, `c1` is less than 50, and `final` is a list containing the value `n`.**
