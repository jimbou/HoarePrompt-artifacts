Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` is math.ceil(`zero` * 100 / `n`), `one_perc` is math.ceil((`o` - `one`) * 100 / (`n` - `n` + 1)), `lst` is a list containing values `i` + 1 if `zero_perc` >= 50 and `one_perc` >= 50 for all `i` in range(`n` - 1), `ele` is the last element in the list `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst` and `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n`-1)/2 if `n` is odd, `pk` is an integer equal to `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n`-1)/2 if `n` is odd, `t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `i` is `n` - 1, `c1` is less than 50, and `final` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for elem in lst:
    if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
        final.append(elem)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` is math.ceil(`zero` * 100 / `n`), `one_perc` is math.ceil((`o` - `one`) * 100 / (`n` - `n` + 1)), `lst` is a list containing values `i` + 1 if `zero_perc` >= 50 and `one_perc` >= 50 for all `i` in range(`n` - 1) and must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the last element in the list `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst` and `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n`-1)/2 if `n` is odd, `pk` is an integer equal to `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n`-1)/2 if `n` is odd, `t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `i` is `n` - 1, `c1` is less than 50, `elem` is the first element in the list `lst`, and `final` is a list containing the first element in the list `lst` if the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in the list `lst` is equal to the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst` and `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n`-1)/2 if `n` is odd.

Otherwise, `final` is a list containing the first element in the list `lst` if the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in the list `lst` is equal to the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst` and `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n`-1)/2 if `n` is odd, and the second element in the list `lst` has been appended to `final`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
