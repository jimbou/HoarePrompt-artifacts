Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is 0, `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it is 0, `lst` is a list containing the integer 1, `ele` is undefined, `mini` is 10^8, `i` is 0, the current value of `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, the current value of `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is an empty list, `pk` is an integer equal to `n // 2` if `n` is even or `(n-1)/2` if `n` is odd, `c1` is undefined, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `lst` now contains the integer 1, which is the value of `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
