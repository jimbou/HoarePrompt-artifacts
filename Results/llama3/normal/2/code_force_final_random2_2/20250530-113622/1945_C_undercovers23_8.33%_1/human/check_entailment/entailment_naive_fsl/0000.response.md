Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly determines the position of the house after which the road should be laid to satisfy the condition of having at least half of the residents on each side satisfied with the choice.

The program iterates through the string `s` and keeps track of the number of zeros and ones on the left and right sides of the road. It checks if the percentage of zeros on the left side and ones on the right side is at least 50% and if so, adds the current position to the list `lst`. Finally, it finds the position with the minimum absolute difference from the middle of the village and prints it.

The program handles all edge cases correctly, including when the number of houses is even or odd, and when the number of zeros or ones is zero. It also correctly handles the case when there are multiple suitable positions with the minimum absolute difference from the middle of the village.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly with the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
