Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `(n-1)/2`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `pk` is calculated as the integer division of `n` by 2, which is equivalent to `(n-1)/2` since `n` is an odd integer. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.
