The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 and greater than 2. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 and greater than 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', otherwise it is 0, `one` is 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '1', otherwise it is 0, `lst` is a list containing the integer 1 if both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, otherwise it is an empty list, `mini` is 10^8, if `n` is even, `pk` is an integer between 1 and 1.5*10^5, if `n` is odd, `pk` is an integer equal to (`n-1`)/2, `i` is 2, `zero_perc` is math.ceil(`zero` * 100 / (`i` + 1)), and `one_perc` is math.ceil((`o` - `one`) * 100 / (`n` - `i` - 1)), and if both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, `lst` now contains the integer 2**
