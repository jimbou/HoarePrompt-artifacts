Output State: **`t` is 0, `_` is `t`, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains no test cases, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` is math.ceil(`zero` * 100 / `n`), `one_perc` is math.ceil((`o` - `one`) * 100 / (`n` - `n` + 1)), `lst` is a list containing values `i` + 1 if `zero_perc` >= 50 and `one_perc` >= 50 for all `i` in range(`n` - 1), `ele` is the last element in the list `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst` and `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n`-1)/2 if `n` is odd, `pk` is an integer equal to `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n`-1)/2 if `n` is odd, `i` is `n` - 1, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, `elem` is the last element in the list `lst`, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in `lst` that have an absolute difference with `pk` equal to the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst` and `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n`-1)/2 if `n` is odd. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, then `final` contains 0. Otherwise, `n` has been appended to `final`, and the first element of the sorted list `final` is being printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state is such that the loop counter `_` has reached the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The input variables `n` and `s` still hold their values from the last test case. The variables `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`, `ele`, `mini`, `pk`, `i`, `c1`, `elem`, and `final` also retain their values from the last test case. The loop has finished executing, and the program is ready to terminate.
