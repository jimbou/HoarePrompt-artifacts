Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0, `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise `one` is 0, `zero_perc` is undefined, `one_perc` is undefined, `lst` is an empty list, `ele` is undefined, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele` and `n // 2` if `n` is even or `(n-1)/2` if `n` is odd, `pk` is an integer equal to `n // 2` if `n` is even or `(n-1)/2` if `n` is odd, `t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `i` is 0, `c1` is less than 50, `final` is a list containing the value `n`.***
