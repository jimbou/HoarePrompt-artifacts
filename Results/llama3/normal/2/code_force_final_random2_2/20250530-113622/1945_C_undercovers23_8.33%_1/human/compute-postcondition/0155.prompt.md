Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the number of '1's in s, z is the number of '0's in s, zero is 0, one is 0, zero_perc is undefined, one_perc is undefined, lst is an empty list, ele is undefined, mini is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between pk and ele and n // 2 if n is even or (n-1)/2 if n is odd, pk is an integer equal to n // 2 if n is even or (n-1)/2 if n is odd, t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, i is n-1, c1 is less than 50, final is a list containing the value n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
    one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0, `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise `one` is 0, `zero_perc` is math.ceil(`zero` * 100 / (`i` + 1)), `one_perc` is math.ceil((`o` - `one`) * 100 / (`n` - `i` - 1)), `lst` is a list containing the value `i` + 1 if `zero_perc` >= 50 and `one_perc` >= 50, otherwise `lst` is an empty list, `ele` is undefined, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele` and `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n`-1)/2 if `n` is odd, `pk` is an integer equal to `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n`-1)/2 if `n` is odd, `t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `i` is 0, `c1` is less than 50, `final` is a list containing the value `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `z` is the number of '0's in `s` plus one, `zero` is 1, `one` is 0, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil((z+1) * 100 / (i + 1))`, and `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. If `s[i]` is '1', then `o` is the number of '1's in `s` plus one, `zero` is 0, `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, and `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. In both cases, `lst` is a list containing the value `i + 1` if `zero_perc` >= 50 and `one_perc` >= 50, otherwise `lst` is an empty list. Additionally, `ele` is undefined, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele` and `n // 2` if `n` is even or `(n-1)/2` if `n` is odd, `pk` is an integer equal to `n // 2` if `n` is even or `(n-1)/2` if `n` is odd, `t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `i` is 2, `c1` is less than 50, and `final` is a list containing the value `n`. If `zero_perc` >= 50 and `one_perc` >= 50, then `lst` contains the value `i + 1`, otherwise `lst` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 3, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`. If `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is a list containing the value `i` + 1. Otherwise, `lst` is an empty list. Additionally, `ele` is undefined, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele` and `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n`-1)/2 if `n` is odd, `pk` is an integer equal to `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n`-1)/2 if `n` is odd, `t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `i` is 3, `c1` is less than 50, and `final` is a list containing the value `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
