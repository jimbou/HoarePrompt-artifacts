Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is a list containing the indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, `mini` is 10^8, if `n` is even, `pk` is an integer between 1 and 1.5*10^5, if `n` is odd, `pk` is an integer equal to `(n-1)/2`, `i` is `n-1`, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, and `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variables that are affected by the loop head and body. The loop iterates `n-1` times, and in each iteration, it updates the values of `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc` based on the current character in the string `s`. The list `lst` is updated with the indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50. After the loop finishes, the values of `zero` and `one` are reset to 0, and the value of `i` is set to `n-1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
