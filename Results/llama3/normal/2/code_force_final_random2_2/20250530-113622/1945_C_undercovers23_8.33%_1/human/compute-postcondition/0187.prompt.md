Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (3 <= n <= 3*10^5) and then a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    if n % 2 == 0:
        pk = n // 2
    else:
        pk = n // 2
    sl = list(s)
    o = sl.count('1')
    z = sl.count('0')
    zero, one = 0, 0
    lst = []
    mini = pow(10, 8)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] == '0':
            zero += 1
        else:
            one += 1
        zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
        one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
        if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
            lst.append(i + 1)
    for ele in lst:
        mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))
    final = []
    for elem in lst:
        if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
            final.append(elem)
    final.sort()
    if len(final) == 0:
        c1 = o * 100 // n
        if c1 >= 50:
            final.append(0)
        else:
            final.append(n)
    print(final[0])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is a list containing the indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, `ele` is the last element in the list, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, if `n` is even, `pk` is an integer between 1 and 1.5*10^5, if `n` is odd, `pk` is an integer equal to `(n-1)/2`, `i` is `n-1`, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, and `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements `elem` in the list `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`. If `final` is empty, `c1` is the integer part of `o * 100 / n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` contains an additional element 0. If `c1` is less than 50, `final` contains the value `n`, and the first element of the final list is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in the first `n` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in the first `n` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of (`zero` * 100 / `n`), `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / 0) and is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is an empty list, `ele` is undefined, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele` and `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n-1`)/2 if `n` is odd, `pk` is an integer equal to `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n-1`)/2 if `n` is odd, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `i` is `n-1`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, then `final` is a list containing 0, indicating that there is an element in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`. Otherwise, `final` is a list containing the value `n`, indicating that there is an element in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, and `c1` is less than 50, and the first element of the list `final` is printed which is either 0 or `n`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` is math.ceil(`zero` * 100 / `n`), `one_perc` is math.ceil((`o` - `one`) * 100 / (`n` - `n` + 1)), `lst` is a list containing values `i` + 1 if `zero_perc` >= 50 and `one_perc` >= 50 for all `i` in range(`n` - 1), `ele` is the last element in the list `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst` and `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n`-1)/2 if `n` is odd, `pk` is an integer equal to `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n`-1)/2 if `n` is odd, `t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `i` is `n` - 1, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, `elem` is the last element in the list `lst`, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in `lst` that have an absolute difference with `pk` equal to the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst` and `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n`-1)/2 if `n` is odd. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, then `final` contains 0. Otherwise, `n` has been appended to `final`, and the first element of the sorted list `final` is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
