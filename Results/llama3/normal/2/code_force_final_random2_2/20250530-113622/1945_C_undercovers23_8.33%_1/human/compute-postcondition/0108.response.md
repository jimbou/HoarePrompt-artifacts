Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in the first `n` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in the first `n` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of (`zero` * 100 / `n`), `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / 0) and is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is a list containing at least 2 integers, `ele` is the second last integer in the list, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele` and `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n-1`)/2 if `n` is odd, `final` is a list containing the first element in the list if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, otherwise `final` is a list containing the second element in the list, `pk` is an integer equal to `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n-1`)/2 if `n` is odd, `c1` is undefined, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `elem` is the second element in the list.**

The code adds the second element in the list (`elem`) to the `final` list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
