State: **n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the number of '1's in s, z is the number of '0's in s, zero is 1 if s[i] is '0', otherwise it is 0, one is 1 if s[i] is '1', otherwise it is 0, if the current value of zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and the current value of one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, then lst is a list containing the integer 1. Otherwise, lst is an empty list, ele is undefined, mini is 10^8, i is 1, final is an empty list, pk is an integer equal to n // 2 if n is even or (n-1)/2 if n is odd, c1 is undefined, t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1**
