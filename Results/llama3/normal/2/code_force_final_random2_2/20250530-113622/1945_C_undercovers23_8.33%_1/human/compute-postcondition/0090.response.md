Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `o` is the number of '1's in `s` and `z` is the number of '0's in `s` plus 2. If `s[i]` is '1', then `o` is the number of '1's in `s` plus 2 and `z` is the number of '0's in `s`. `zero` is 2 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is 1. `one` is 2 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it is 1. `zero_perc` is the ceiling of (`zero` * 100 / (`i` + 1)), `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / (`n` - `i` - 1)), if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is a list containing the integer `i` + 1, otherwise `lst` is an empty list, `ele` is undefined, `mini` is 10^8, `i` is 2, `final` is an empty list, `pk` is an integer equal to `n` // 2 if `n` is even or (`n`-1)/2 if `n` is odd, `c1` is undefined, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2.***
