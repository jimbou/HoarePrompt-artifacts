Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` <= `n`, `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `i` is `n - k`, `pref` is the sum of its original value and the sum of all elements in `lista_A` that are less than the corresponding elements in `lista_B`, `soma_b` is the sum of all elements in `lista_B` that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in `lista_A`, `resultado` is positive infinity, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - k, n):
    resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
    soma_b += lista_B[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k < n, lista_A is a list of n integers in reverse order, lista_B is a list of n integers in reverse order, i is n - k, pref is the sum of its original value and the sum of all elements in lista_A that are less than the corresponding elements in lista_B, soma_b is the sum of all elements in lista_B that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in lista_A plus lista_B[i], resultado is the minimum of its original value and pref + soma_b + lista_A[i], stdin is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k < n, lista_A is a list of n integers in reverse order, lista_B is a list of n integers in reverse order, i is n - k + 1, pref is the sum of its original value and the sum of all elements in lista_A that are less than the corresponding elements in lista_B, soma_b is the sum of all elements in lista_B that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in lista_A plus lista_B[i] plus lista_B[i], resultado is the minimum of its original value and pref + soma_b + lista_A[i] plus lista_B[i], stdin is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is a positive integer greater than n - k + 2, k is a positive integer such that k < n, lista_A is a list of n integers in reverse order, lista_B is a list of n integers in reverse order, i is n - k + 2, pref is the sum of its original value and the sum of all elements in lista_A that are less than the corresponding elements in lista_B, soma_b is the sum of all elements in lista_B that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in lista_A plus lista_B[i] plus lista_B[i], resultado is the minimum of its original value and pref + soma_b + lista_A[i] plus lista_B[i], stdin is empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
