Output State: **`numero_testes` is at least 3, and the function `func_1()` has been executed `numero_testes` times.**

This output state means that the loop has executed for the number of times specified by the value of `numero_testes`, and the function `func_1()` has been called that many times. The state of other variables in the initial state, such as the test cases in stdin, remains unchanged.
