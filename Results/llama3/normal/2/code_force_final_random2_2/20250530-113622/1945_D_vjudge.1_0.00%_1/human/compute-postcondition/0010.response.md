Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` < `n`, `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1. If `lista_A[i]` is less than `lista_B[i]`, then `pref` is equal to its original value plus `soma_b` and `lista_A[i]`, and `soma_b` is 0. Otherwise, `pref` is 0, `soma_b` is `lista_B[i]`, and `lista_A[i]` is not less than `lista_B[i]`.***
