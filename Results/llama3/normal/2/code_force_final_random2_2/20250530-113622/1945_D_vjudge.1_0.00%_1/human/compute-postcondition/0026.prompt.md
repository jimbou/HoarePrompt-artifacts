You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains three inputs: first two integers n and k separated by space and then two lists of integers separated by space. n and k are positive integers such that k <= n, and the two lists have n integers each.
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_A.reverse()
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B.reverse()
    soma_b = 0
    pref = 0
    for i in range(n - k):
        if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:
            pref += soma_b
            pref += lista_A[i]
            soma_b = 0
        else:
            soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k <= n, lista_A is a list of n integers in reverse order, lista_B is a list of n integers in reverse order, stdin is empty, i is n - k, pref is the sum of its original value and the sum of all elements in lista_A that are less than the corresponding elements in lista_B, soma_b is the sum of all elements in lista_B that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in lista_A.
    resultado = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - k, n):
        resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
        
        soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k <= n, lista_A is a list of n integers in reverse order, lista_B is a list of n integers in reverse order, i is n, pref is the sum of its original value and the sum of all elements in lista_A that are less than the corresponding elements in lista_B, soma_b is the sum of all elements in lista_B that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in lista_A plus the sum of all elements in lista_B from index n - k to n, resultado is the minimum of its original value and the sum of pref, soma_b, and the minimum element in lista_A from index n - k to n, stdin is empty.
    print(resultado)
    #This is printed: The minimum of the original value of resultado and the sum of pref, soma_b, and the minimum element in lista_A from index n - k to n

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
