Output State: **`numero_testes` is at least 1, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**

The code calls the function `func_1()`, which means that the function's body will be executed. However, since the function's definition is not provided, we cannot determine the exact changes made to the program's state. Therefore, we can only conclude that the function has been executed, without specifying any further changes. The value of `numero_testes` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the function call.
