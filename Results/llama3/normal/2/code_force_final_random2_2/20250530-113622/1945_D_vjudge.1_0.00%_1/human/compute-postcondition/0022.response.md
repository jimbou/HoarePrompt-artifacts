Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than n - k + 2, k is a positive integer such that k < n, lista_A is a list of n integers in reverse order, lista_B is a list of n integers in reverse order, i is n - k + 2, pref is the sum of its original value and the sum of all elements in lista_A that are less than the corresponding elements in lista_B, soma_b is the sum of all elements in lista_B that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in lista_A plus lista_B[i] plus lista_B[i], resultado is the minimum of its original value and pref + soma_b + lista_A[i] plus lista_B[i], stdin is empty.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `resultado` and `soma_b`. The first line updates `resultado` to be the minimum of its original value and the sum of `pref`, `soma_b`, and `lista_A[i]`. The second line increments `soma_b` by the value of `lista_B[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
