Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k <= n, lista_A is a list of n integers in reverse order, lista_B is a list of n integers in reverse order, stdin is empty, i is n - k, pref is the sum of its original value and the sum of all elements in lista_A that are less than the corresponding elements in lista_B, soma_b is the sum of all elements in lista_B that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in lista_A.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop counter `i` has reached its final value `n - k`, and the prefix sum `pref` has accumulated the sum of all elements in `lista_A` that are less than the corresponding elements in `lista_B`. The sum of elements in `lista_B` that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in `lista_A` is stored in `soma_b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
