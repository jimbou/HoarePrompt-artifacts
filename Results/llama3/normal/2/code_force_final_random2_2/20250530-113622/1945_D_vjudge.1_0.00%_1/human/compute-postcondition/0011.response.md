The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, n and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n` and `k`. If `i` is less than `n - k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` < `n`. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n - k` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` < `n`, `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2, `n - k` must be greater than 1**
