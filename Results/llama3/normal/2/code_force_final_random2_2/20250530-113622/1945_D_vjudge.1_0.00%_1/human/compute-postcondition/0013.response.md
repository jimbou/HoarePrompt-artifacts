Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` < `n`, `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `i` is 2, `n - k` is greater than 1, `soma_b` is increased by the third last element of `lista_B`**

In this output state, the value of `soma_b` has been updated by adding the third last element of `lista_B` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The third last element of `lista_B` is used because `i` is 2 and `lista_B` is in reverse order.
