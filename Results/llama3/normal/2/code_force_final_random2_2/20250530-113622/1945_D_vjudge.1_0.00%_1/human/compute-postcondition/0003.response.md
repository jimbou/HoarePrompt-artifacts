To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for _ in range(numero_testes):`, which means the loop will execute as long as the range of `numero_testes` is not exhausted.

The current state is: `numero_testes` is at least 1, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.

Since the loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body, we can ignore it. The only variable in the loop head that affects the loop execution is `numero_testes`.

To execute the loop again, `numero_testes` must be greater than the current iteration count. Since we don't know the exact value of `numero_testes`, we can only say that it must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`numero_testes` is at least 2, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**
