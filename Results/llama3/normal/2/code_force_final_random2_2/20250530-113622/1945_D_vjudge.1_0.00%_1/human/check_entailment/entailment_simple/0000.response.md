Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The first function calculates the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach the first m positions in the queue. It iterates through the lists of integers from the end to the beginning, keeping track of the sum of the smaller values in lista_B and the sum of the smaller values in lista_A that are less than the corresponding values in lista_B. Then, it iterates through the last k positions and calculates the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach each position.

The second function reads the number of test cases and calls the first function for each test case.

The program correctly handles the inputs and outputs as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
