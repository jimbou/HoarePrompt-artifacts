Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k < n, lista_A is a list of n integers in reverse order, lista_B is a list of n integers in reverse order, stdin is empty, i is 2, pref is the sum of its original value, soma_b, and lista_A[2], soma_b is 0, n - k must be greater than 1**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, `lista_B`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `pref` is updated by adding `soma_b` and `lista_A[2]` to its original value. The value of `soma_b` is reset to 0. The constraint `n - k > 1` still holds true.
