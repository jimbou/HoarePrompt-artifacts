The code snippet provided is a function call to `func_1()`. The initial state mentions that `func_1()` has already been executed twice. Since the code snippet only calls `func_1()` once more, the total number of times `func_1()` has been executed will increase by 1.

Output State: **`numero_testes` is at least 1, and the function `func_1()` has been executed three times.**
