Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k < n, lista_A is a list of n integers in reverse order, lista_B is a list of n integers in reverse order, stdin is empty, i is 2, n - k must be greater than 1. If lista_A[2] is less than lista_B[2], pref is the sum of its original value, soma_b, and lista_A[2], soma_b is 0. Otherwise, soma_b is increased by the third last element of lista_B.***
