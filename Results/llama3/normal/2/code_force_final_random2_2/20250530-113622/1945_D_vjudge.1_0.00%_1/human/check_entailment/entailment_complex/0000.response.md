Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. The program consists of two functions: `func_1()` and `func_2()`. 

`func_1()` reads input from stdin, processes two lists of integers, and prints the minimum sum of certain elements. It takes no parameters and returns no value, but instead prints the result. The function's purpose is to find the minimum sum of elements in the second list and the minimum element in the first list, considering certain conditions.

`func_2()` reads the number of test cases from standard input, then iterates through each test case, executing the `func_1()` function for each one, without returning any value or modifying the input variables.

The program is correct because it meets the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly reads the input, processes the data, and prints the minimum sum of certain elements for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
