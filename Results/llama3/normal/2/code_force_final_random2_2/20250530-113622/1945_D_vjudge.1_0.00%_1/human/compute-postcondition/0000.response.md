The code `numero_testes = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `numero_testes`. The stdin contains an integer representing the number of test cases, followed by a series of test cases. Since the first integer is accepted and assigned to `numero_testes`, the stdin now contains a series of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and m separated by spaces, and the second line contains n integers separated by spaces.

Output State: **`numero_testes` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains a series of test cases, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and m separated by spaces, and the second line contains n integers separated by spaces.**
