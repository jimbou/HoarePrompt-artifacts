Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` < `n`, `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1, `soma_b` is `soma_b` + `lista_B[1]`. If `lista_A[1]` is less than `lista_B[1]`, then `pref` is equal to its original value plus `soma_b` and `lista_A[1]`. Otherwise, `pref` is 0, `soma_b` is `lista_B[1]`, and `lista_A[1]` is not less than `lista_B[1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `soma_b` has been updated by adding the value of `lista_B[1]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `pref` and the comparison between `lista_A[1]` and `lista_B[1]` are still valid.
