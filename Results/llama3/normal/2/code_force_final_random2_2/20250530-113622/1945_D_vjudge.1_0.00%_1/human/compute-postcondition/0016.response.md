Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` <= `n`, `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `i` is `n - k`, `pref` is the sum of its original value and the sum of all elements in `lista_A` that are less than the corresponding elements in `lista_B`, `soma_b` is the sum of all elements in `lista_B` that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in `lista_A`, `resultado` is positive infinity, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their original properties and values, except for `resultado`, which is now assigned the value of positive infinity. The stdin remains empty, as no input operation was performed.
