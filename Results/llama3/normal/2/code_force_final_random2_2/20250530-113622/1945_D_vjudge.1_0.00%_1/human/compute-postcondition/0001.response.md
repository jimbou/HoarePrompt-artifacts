To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `_` and `numero_testes`. The loop will execute if `numero_testes` is at least 1. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, we don't need to adjust its state.

State: **`numero_testes` is at least 1**
