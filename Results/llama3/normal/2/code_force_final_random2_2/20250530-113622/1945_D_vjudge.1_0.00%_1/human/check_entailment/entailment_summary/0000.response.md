Reasoning: 
The problem requires finding the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first m people in line. The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` reads the input for a single test case, processes the lists of integers, and prints the minimum sum of certain elements. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum sum of elements in the second list and the minimum element in the first list, considering the conditions given in the problem.

`func_2` reads the number of test cases from standard input and iterates through each test case, executing `func_1` for each one. This function correctly handles multiple test cases.

Since both functions work together to solve the problem correctly, and there are no errors in the given code, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
