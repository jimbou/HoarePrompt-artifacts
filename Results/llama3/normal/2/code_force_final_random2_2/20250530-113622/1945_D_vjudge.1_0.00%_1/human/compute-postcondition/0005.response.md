To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(numero_testes):`, which means the loop will execute as long as the range of `numero_testes` has not been exhausted.

At the end of the previous iteration, `numero_testes` is at least 2, and the function `func_1()` has been executed twice.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

* The loop variable `_` is not explicitly used in the loop body, so we don't need to adjust its state.
* The `numero_testes` variable is used to determine the range of the loop. Since the loop has already executed twice, we need to decrement `numero_testes` by 1 to reflect the remaining number of iterations.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`numero_testes` is at least 1, and the function `func_1()` has been executed twice.**

Note that we don't need to adjust the state of `func_1()` since it's not a variable in the loop head.
