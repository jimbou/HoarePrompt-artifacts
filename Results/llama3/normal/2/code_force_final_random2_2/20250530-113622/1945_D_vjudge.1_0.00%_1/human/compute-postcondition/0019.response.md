The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - k`, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k < n`. For the loop to execute again `i` must be `n - k + 1`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k < n`, `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `i` is `n - k + 1`, `pref` is the sum of its original value and the sum of all elements in `lista_A` that are less than the corresponding elements in `lista_B`, `soma_b` is the sum of all elements in `lista_B` that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in `lista_A` plus `lista_B[i]`, `resultado` is the minimum of its original value and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`, `stdin` is empty.**
