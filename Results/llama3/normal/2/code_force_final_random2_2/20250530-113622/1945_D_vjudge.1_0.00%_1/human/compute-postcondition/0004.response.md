Output State: **`numero_testes` is at least 2, and the function `func_1()` has been executed twice.**

The code snippet simply calls the function `func_1()` again, without modifying any variables or introducing new ones. Since the function has already been executed once according to the initial state, this additional call means it has now been executed twice. The value of `numero_testes` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the function call.
