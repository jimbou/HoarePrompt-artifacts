The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, n and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n` and `k`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - k + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k < n`. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is `n - k + 2` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `n - k + 2` and `k` must be less than `n - (n - k + 2) + 1` or `k` must be less than `k - 1`. But `k` cannot be less than `k - 1` because `k` is a positive integer. So for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `n - k + 2` and `k` must be equal to `k - 1` or `k` must be equal to `k`. So for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `n - k + 2` and `k` must be equal to `k`. So for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `n - k + 2`.
State: **n is a positive integer greater than n - k + 2, k is a positive integer such that k < n, lista_A is a list of n integers in reverse order, lista_B is a list of n integers in reverse order, i is n - k + 2, pref is the sum of its original value and the sum of all elements in lista_A that are less than the corresponding elements in lista_B, soma_b is the sum of all elements in lista_B that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in lista_A plus lista_B[i] plus lista_B[i], resultado is the minimum of its original value and pref + soma_b + lista_A[i] plus lista_B[i], stdin is empty.**
