The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers of length `t-1`, `i` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 2, `max` is either 0 or the maximum of the minimum of adjacent elements in `a` that is greater than 0**
