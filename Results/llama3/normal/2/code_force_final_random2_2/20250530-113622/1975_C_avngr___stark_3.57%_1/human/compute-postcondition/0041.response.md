Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers of length `t-1`, `i` is 3, `max` is the minimum of `a[3]` and `a[2]`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `max` is determined by the minimum of the 3rd and 2nd elements of the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
