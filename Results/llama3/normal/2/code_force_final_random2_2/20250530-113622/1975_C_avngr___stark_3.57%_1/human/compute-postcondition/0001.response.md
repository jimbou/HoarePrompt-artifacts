To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the loop variable `_` (although `_` is a throwaway variable, its value is still determined by the range it iterates over).

Given that `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), and considering the loop `for _ in range(t):`, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. However, since `t` is already constrained to be between 2 and 10^5, it inherently meets this condition. Thus, the primary adjustment is ensuring that `t` is indeed within this range to guarantee the loop's execution.

At the start of the loop, `_` would be the first value in the range, which is 0, since ranges in Python are 0-indexed.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), stdin contains a list of integers (1 <= integer <= 10^9) of length equal to `t`, `_` is 0**
