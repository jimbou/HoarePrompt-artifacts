Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers of length `t-1`, `i` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 1, the current value of `max` is the maximum of the minimum of adjacent elements in `a` that is greater than the initial value of `max` (0), and the maximum of the minimum of adjacent elements in `a` that is greater than the initial value of `max` (0) is being printed. The minimum of the adjacent elements `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is greater than the current value of `max`***
