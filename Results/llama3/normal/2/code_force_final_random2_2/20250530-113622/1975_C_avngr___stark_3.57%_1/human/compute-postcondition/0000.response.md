The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two inputs, the first input is an integer (2 <= integer <= 10^5), which is assigned to `t`. The second input, a list of integers, is still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), stdin contains a list of integers (1 <= integer <= 10^9) of length equal to `t`.**
