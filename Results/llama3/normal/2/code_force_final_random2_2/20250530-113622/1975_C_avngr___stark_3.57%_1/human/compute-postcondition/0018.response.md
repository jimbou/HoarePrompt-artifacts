The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, i is n does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 and i is now 1. 
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers of length `t-1`, `i` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 1, `max` is the maximum of the minimum of adjacent elements in `a` that is greater than the initial value of `max` (0), and the maximum of the minimum of adjacent elements in `a` that is greater than the initial value of `max` (0) is being printed**
