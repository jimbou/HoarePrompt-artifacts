To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head variables, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers of length `t-1`, `i` is 3, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 1, `max` is either the minimum of `a[2]` and `a[1]` or remains unchanged**
