Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^9 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers of length t-1, `i` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 0. If the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i-1]` is higher than the current value of `max`, then `max` is updated to the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i-1]` and its value is higher than 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
