To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^9 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `n` is already greater than 2, it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^9 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers of length t-1, `i` is 3, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 0**
