Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^9 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers of length t-1, `max` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i-1]`, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1. The current value of `max` is higher than 0**

In this output state, the value of `max` has been updated to be the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i-1]`, which is higher than 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
