Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^9 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers of length t-1, `max` is 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1. The current value of `max` is still 0. The current value of the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i-1]` is higher than 0***
