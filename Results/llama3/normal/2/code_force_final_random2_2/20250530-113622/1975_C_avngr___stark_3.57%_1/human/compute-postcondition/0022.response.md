To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers of length `t-1`, `i` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 1, `max` is either 0 or the minimum of `a[1]` and `a[0]`**
