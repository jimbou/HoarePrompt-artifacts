Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), a is a list of integers of length t-1, i is n, stdin is empty, _ is 2, and the maximum of the minimum of adjacent elements in a that is greater than the initial value of max (0) is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max:
        max = min(a[i], a[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers of length `t-1`, `i` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 2. If the minimum of `a[1]` and `a[0]` is greater than the initial value of `max` (0), then `max` is updated to this minimum value and the maximum of the minimum of adjacent elements in `a` that is greater than the initial value of `max` (0) is being printed. Otherwise, no update occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers of length `t-1`, `i` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 2. If the minimum of `a[2]` and `a[1]` is greater than the current `max`, then `max` is updated to be the minimum of `a[2]` and `a[1]`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers of length `t-1`, `i` is 3, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 2. If the minimum of `a[3]` and `a[2]` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to be the minimum of `a[3]` and `a[2]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
