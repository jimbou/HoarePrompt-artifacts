To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers of length t-1, `i` is `n`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 1, `max` is the maximum of the minimum of adjacent elements in `a` that is greater than the initial value of `max` (0), and the maximum of the minimum of adjacent elements in `a` that is greater than the initial value of `max` (0) is being printed**
