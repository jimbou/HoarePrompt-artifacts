Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The problem description states that Mocha can perform the operation until the array contains only the same number, and the goal is to find the maximum possible value of this number. However, the program only checks the minimum value between adjacent elements and updates the maximum value if the minimum value is greater than the current maximum. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the median of the subarray, which is the key factor in determining the maximum possible value.

For example, consider the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The program will output 2, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 4, because Mocha can perform the operations as described in the problem description to get the array [4, 4, 4, 4, 4].

The program needs to be modified to correctly implement the logic of finding the maximum possible value by considering the median of the subarray.
