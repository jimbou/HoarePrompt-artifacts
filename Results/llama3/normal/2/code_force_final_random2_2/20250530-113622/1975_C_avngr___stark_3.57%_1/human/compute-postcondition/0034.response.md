Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers of length `t-1`, `i` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 2, the maximum of the minimum of adjacent elements in `a` that is greater than the initial value of max (0) is being printed, and the current value of `min(a[i], a[i - 1])` is greater than the current value of `max`***
