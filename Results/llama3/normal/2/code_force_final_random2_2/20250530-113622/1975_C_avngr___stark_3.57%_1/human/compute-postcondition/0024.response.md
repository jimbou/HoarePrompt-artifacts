Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers of length `t-1`, `i` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 1. If the minimum of `a[2]` and `a[1]` is greater than the current `max`, then `max` is updated to be the minimum of `a[2]` and `a[1]`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
