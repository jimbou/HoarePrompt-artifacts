To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only object in the loop head is `_`, which is an iteration variable, and `t`, which is the range limit.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive).

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `_` is 2
* `t` is still an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive)

The other variables `n`, `a`, `i`, `stdin`, and the maximum of the minimum of adjacent elements in `a` are not affected by the loop head and remain the same.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers of length `t-1`, `i` is `n`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 2, and the maximum of the minimum of adjacent elements in `a` that is greater than the initial value of `max` (0) is being printed**
