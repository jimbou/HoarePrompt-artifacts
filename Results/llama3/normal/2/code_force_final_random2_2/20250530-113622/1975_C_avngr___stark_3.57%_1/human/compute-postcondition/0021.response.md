Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers of length `t-1`, `i` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 1. If the minimum of `a[1]` and `a[0]` is greater than the initial value of `max` (0), then `max` is updated to the minimum of `a[1]` and `a[0]`, and the minimum of `a[1]` and `a[0]` is being printed. Otherwise, no update is made to `max`.**
