Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^9 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers of length t-1, `i` is 3, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 0. If the minimum of `a[3]` and `a[2]` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to be the minimum of `a[3]` and `a[2]`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
