Postcondition: **`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list `palka`. If `d` does not contain key `i`, then `d` contains key `i` with a value of 1 and `pl` is a list of integers that includes the first integer in the list `palka`, the second integer in the list `palka` and the third integer in the list `palka` if `i` is not in `pl`, otherwise `pl` is a list of integers that includes the first integer in the list `palka`, the second integer in the list `palka` and the third integer in the list `palka` twice. If `d` contains key `i`, then `d` contains key `i` with a value greater than or equal to 2 and `pl` is a list of integers that includes the first integer in the list `palka`, the second integer in the list `palka` and the third integer in the list `palka` if `i` is not in `pl`, otherwise `pl` is a list of integers that includes the first integer in the list `palka`, the second integer in the list `palka` and the third integer in the list `palka` twice. If `i` is in `pl`, then `pl` is a list of integers that includes the first integer in the list `palka` and the third integer in the list `palka`.**
