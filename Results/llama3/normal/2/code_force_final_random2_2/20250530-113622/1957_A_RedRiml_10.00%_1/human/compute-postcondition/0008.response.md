Postcondition: ***`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is an empty list. If the first integer `i` is not in dictionary `d`, then `d` is updated with key `i` and value 1. Otherwise, the value of key `i` in dictionary `d` is incremented by 1.***
