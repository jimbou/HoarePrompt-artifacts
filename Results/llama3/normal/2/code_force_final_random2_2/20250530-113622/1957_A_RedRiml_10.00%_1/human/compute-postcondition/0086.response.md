Output State: **`w` is at least 3, stdin contains t-4 test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is a list containing the first integer in `palka`, `d` is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is 1 if `i` was not in `d` before, otherwise it is one more than the previous value, `j` is undefined, `shapes` is undefined, `i` is the first integer in the list.**

The code appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`. Since `i` is the first integer in the list `palka`, `pl` now contains this integer. The other variables remain unchanged.
