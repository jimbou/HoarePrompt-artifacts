Output State: **w is at least 3, stdin contains t-4 test cases, ln is an integer between 1 and 100, palka is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, pl is an empty list, d is a dictionary that contains the key i with value 1, j is undefined, shapes is undefined, i is the first integer in the list.**

In this output state, the value of the dictionary d has been updated to include the key i with value 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-4 test cases, and the values of w, ln, palka, pl, j, and shapes are the same as in the initial state.
