Output State: **`w` is at least 3, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `d` is a dictionary that contains the key i with a value that is 1 if i was not in d before, otherwise it is one more than the previous value, `i` is the third integer in `palka`, `j` is undefined, `shapes` is undefined. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is a list containing the first three integers in `palka`. The value of `d[i]` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `d[i]` has been increased by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `d` now contains the key `i` with a value that is one more than its previous value. The rest of the variables maintain their initial values and properties.
