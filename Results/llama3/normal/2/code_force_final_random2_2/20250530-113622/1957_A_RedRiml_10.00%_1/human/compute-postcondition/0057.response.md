Output State: **`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list `palka`, `d` contains key `i` with a value of 1, If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is a list of integers that includes the first integer in the list `palka`, the second integer in the list `palka` and the third integer in the list `palka`. If `i` is in `pl`, then `pl` is a list of integers that includes the first integer in the list `palka` and the third integer in the list `palka`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `w` is still at least 2, there are still `t-3` test cases in `stdin`, `ln` is still an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is still a list of integers with at least 3 integers, and `i` is still the third integer in `palka`. The dictionary `d` now definitely contains key `i` with a value of 1. The list `pl` is either a list of integers that includes the first integer in `palka`, the second integer in `palka`, and the third integer in `palka` (if `i` is not in `pl`), or a list of integers that includes the first integer in `palka` and the third integer in `palka` (if `i` is in `pl`).
