Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: w is at least 3, stdin contains t-4 test cases, ln is an integer between 1 and 100, palka is a list of integers, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary, j is undefined, and shapes is undefined.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *w is at least 3, stdin contains t-4 test cases, ln is an integer between 1 and 100, palka is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, if the first integer in palka is not in pl, then pl is a list containing the first integer in palka, d is a dictionary that contains the key i with a value that is 1 if i was not in d before, otherwise it is one more than the previous value, j is undefined, shapes is undefined. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`w` is at least 3, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `d` is a dictionary that contains the key i with a value that is 1 if i was not in d before, otherwise it is one more than the previous value, `i` is the second integer in `palka`, `j` is undefined, `shapes` is undefined. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is a list containing the first two integers in `palka`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`w` is at least 3, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in `palka`, `j` is undefined, `shapes` is undefined. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is a list containing the first three integers in `palka` and `i`, and the dictionary `d` contains the key `i` with a value that is 1 if `i` was not in `d` before, otherwise it is one more than the previous value. If `i` is in `pl`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
