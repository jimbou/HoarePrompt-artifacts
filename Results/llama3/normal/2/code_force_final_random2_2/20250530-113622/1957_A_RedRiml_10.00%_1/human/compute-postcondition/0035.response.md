Postcondition: ***`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` contains at least 3 unique integers from the original `palka` list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in the original `palka` list, `j` is the third unique integer in `pl`. If the frequency of `j` in the original `palka` list is at least 3, then `shapes` is 3. Otherwise, `shapes` is 2.***
