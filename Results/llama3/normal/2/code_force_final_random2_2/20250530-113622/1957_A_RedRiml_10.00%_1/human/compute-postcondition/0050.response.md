To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in palka:`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `palka`. If the list has at least 2 integers, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `palka` has at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list `palka`.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `palka` must have at least 2 integers, and `i` must be the second integer in the list `palka`.

State: **`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `pl` is a list of integers that includes the first integer in the list `palka` if `i` is not in `pl`, `j` is undefined, `shapes` is undefined, `i` is the second integer in the list `palka`, `d` contains key `i` with a value greater than or equal to 1 if `i` is not in `pl`.**
