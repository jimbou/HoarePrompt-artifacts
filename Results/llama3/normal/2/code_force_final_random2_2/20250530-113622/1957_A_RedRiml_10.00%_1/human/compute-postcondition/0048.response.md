Output State: **`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is a list of integers that includes the first integer in the list `palka`, `j` is undefined, `shapes` is undefined, `i` is the first integer in the list `palka`, `d` contains key `i` with a value greater than or equal to 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `w` is still at least 2, and there are still `t-3` test cases in `stdin`. The value of `ln` remains an integer between 1 and 100. The list `palka` still contains at least one integer. The list `pl` now includes the first integer from the list `palka`. The variables `j` and `shapes` are still undefined. The value of `i` is still the first integer in the list `palka`. The dictionary `d` now contains the key `i` with a value greater than or equal to 1.
