Postcondition: ***`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list. If `i` is not in `pl`, `pl` is updated to contain `i` and `d[i]` is either 1 or incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
