Output State: **`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` contains all unique integers from the original `palka` list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in the original `palka` list, `shapes` is 0**

In this output state, the values of `w`, `stdin`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, and `d` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `shapes` which is assigned the value 0.
