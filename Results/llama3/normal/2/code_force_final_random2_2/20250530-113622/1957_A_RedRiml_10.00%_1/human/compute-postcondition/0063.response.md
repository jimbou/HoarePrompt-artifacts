Output State: **`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list of integers that includes all unique integers from the list `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `palka` and each value is the count of occurrences of that integer in the list `palka`, `j` is undefined, `shapes` is 0.**

In this output state, the variable `shapes` has been assigned the value 0, while all other variables remain unchanged. The values of `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, `d`, and `j` are still the same as in the initial state, and `stdin` still contains `t-3` test cases.
