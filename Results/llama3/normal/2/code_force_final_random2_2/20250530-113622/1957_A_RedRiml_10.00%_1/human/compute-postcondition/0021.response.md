Postcondition: ***`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list. If `d` does not contain `i` as a key, `d[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.***
