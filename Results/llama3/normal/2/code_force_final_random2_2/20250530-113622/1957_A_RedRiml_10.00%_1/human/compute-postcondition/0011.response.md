Postcondition: ***`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer. If the integer `i` is not in list `pl`, then `pl` is updated to contain `i` and dictionary `d` is updated with key `i` and value 1 if `i` was not in `d` before, otherwise the value of key `i` in dictionary `d` has been incremented by 1.***
