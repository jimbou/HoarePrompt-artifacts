Postcondition: ***`w` is at least 3, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `pl` is a list containing the first integer in `palka`, `d` is a dictionary that contains the key i with a value that is 1 if i was not in d before, otherwise it is one more than the previous value, `i` is the second integer in `palka`, `j` is undefined, `shapes` is undefined. If `d` does not contain the key `i`, the value of `d[i]` is set to 1. If `d` already contains the key `i`, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.***
