Output State: **w is at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, ln is an integer between 1 and 100, palka is a list of n integers between 1 and 100, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary**

The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to ln. Since stdin contains t-1 test cases, and each test case has two lines, there are now t-2 test cases left in stdin. The second line reads a list of n integers from stdin and assigns it to palka. The third line initializes an empty list pl. The fourth line initializes an empty dictionary d. The value of w is not affected by the code and remains at least 1.
