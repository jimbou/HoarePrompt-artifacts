The code prints the value of `shapes`, which is either the number of elements in `pl` that have a count of at least 3 in `d`, or the number of elements in `pl` that have a count of at least 3 in `d` minus 1, depending on whether the count of `j` in `d` is at least 3.

Since the exact values of `pl`, `d`, and `j` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `shapes`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `shapes`.

Output: **w is at least 3, stdin contains t-4 test cases, ln is an integer between 1 and 100, palka is a list that must have at least 1 element, pl is a list containing all unique integers from palka, d is a dictionary where the keys are the integers from palka and the values are their respective counts, j is the last element in pl. If the count of j in d is at least 3, then shapes is equal to the number of elements in pl that have a count of at least 3 in d. Otherwise, shapes is equal to the number of elements in pl that have a count of at least 3 in d minus 1, and shapes (where shapes is the number of elements in pl that have a count of at least 3 in d, or the number of elements in pl that have a count of at least 3 in d minus 1, depending on whether the count of j in d is at least 3) is printed**
