According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `palka`. If `palka` has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, w is at least 3, stdin contains t-4 test cases, ln is an integer between 1 and 100, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary, j is undefined, and shapes is undefined. So for the loop to be executed  the list `palka` must have at least 1 integer and the variable `i` is the first integer in the list.
State: **w is at least 3, stdin contains t-4 test cases, ln is an integer between 1 and 100, palka is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary, j is undefined, shapes is undefined, i is the first integer in the list**
