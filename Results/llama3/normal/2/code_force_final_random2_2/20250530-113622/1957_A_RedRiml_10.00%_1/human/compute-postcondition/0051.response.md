Output State: **`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `pl` is a list of integers that includes the first integer in the list `palka` if `i` is not in `pl`, `j` is undefined, `shapes` is undefined, `i` is the second integer in the list `palka`, `d` contains key `i` with a value of 1.**

In this output state, the value of `d[i]` has been updated to 1, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial conditions. The stdin still contains `t-3` test cases, and the lists `palka` and `pl` retain their properties. The variables `j` and `shapes` remain undefined.
