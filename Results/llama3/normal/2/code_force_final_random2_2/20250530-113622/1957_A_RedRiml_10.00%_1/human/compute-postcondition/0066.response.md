Output State: **`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list of integers that includes all unique integers from the list `palka` and has at least 1 integer, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `palka` and each value is the count of occurrences of that integer in the list `palka`, `j` is the first integer in `pl`, `shapes` is 1. The current value of `d[j]` is at least 3**

In this output state, the value of `shapes` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `d[j]` is still at least 3, and all other conditions specified in the initial state are still valid.
