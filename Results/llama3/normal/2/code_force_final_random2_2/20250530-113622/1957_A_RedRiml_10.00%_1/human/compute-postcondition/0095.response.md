Output State: **`w` is at least 3, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `d` is a dictionary that contains the key i with a value that is 1, `i` is the third integer in `palka`, `j` is undefined, `shapes` is undefined. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is a list containing the first three integers in `palka`.**

The code sets the value of `d[i]` to 1. Since `i` is the third integer in `palka`, the value of `d[i]` is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
