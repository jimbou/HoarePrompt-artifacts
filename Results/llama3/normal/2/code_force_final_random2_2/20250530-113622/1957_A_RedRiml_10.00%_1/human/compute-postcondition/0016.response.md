Output State: **`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, `pl` is updated accordingly and contains one more integer `i`, and `d` is updated accordingly. If `d` does not contain the key `i`, then `d[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `w` is still at least 1, the number of test cases in `stdin` remains `t-2`, and the value of `ln` is still an integer between 1 and 100. The list `palka` still contains at least 2 integers. The list `pl` now contains one more integer `i` that was appended to it. The dictionary `d` is updated accordingly, meaning that if `i` was not a key in `d`, it is now set to 1, and if `i` was already a key in `d`, its value is incremented by 1.
