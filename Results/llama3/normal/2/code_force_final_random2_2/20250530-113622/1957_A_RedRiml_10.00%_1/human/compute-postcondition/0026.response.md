To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `j` and the list `pl`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `pl`. If `pl` has at least 1 unique integer, the loop will execute. Since `pl` contains all unique integers from the original `palka` list, we need to adjust the state of `pl` to have at least 1 unique integer. Additionally, we need to adjust the state of `j` to be the first unique integer in `pl`.

State: **`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` contains at least 1 unique integer from the original `palka` list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in the original `palka` list, `shapes` is 0, `j` is the first unique integer in `pl`**
