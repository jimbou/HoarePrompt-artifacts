Postcondition: ***w is at least 3, stdin contains t-4 test cases, ln is an integer between 1 and 100, palka is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, if the first integer in palka is not in pl, then pl is a list containing the first integer in palka, d is a dictionary that contains the key i with a value that is 1 if i was not in d before, otherwise it is one more than the previous value, j is undefined, shapes is undefined. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
