Postcondition: ***`w` is at least 3, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` that must have at least 2 elements, `d` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers from `palka` and the values are their respective counts, `j` is the second element in `pl`. If the count of `j` in `d` is at least 3, then `shapes` is 2. Otherwise, `shapes` is 1.***
