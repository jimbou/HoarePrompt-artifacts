Output State: **`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is a list that contains at least one integer and now also contains the integer `i`, `d` is a dictionary that has been updated with key `i` and value 1 if `i` was not in `d` before, otherwise the value of key `i` in dictionary `d` has been incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `pl` has been updated to include the integer `i`, which was not present in the list before. The other variables remain unchanged, with `w` still being at least 1, `stdin` containing `t-2` test cases, `ln` being an integer between 1 and 100, and `palka` being a list of n integers with at least one integer. The dictionary `d` still has the key `i` with a value of 1 if `i` was not present before, or the value of key `i` has been incremented by 1 if it was already present.
