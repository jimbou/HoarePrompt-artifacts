Postcondition: ***`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list `palka`. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is a list of integers that includes the first integer in the list `palka` and the second integer in the list `palka`. If `d` does not contain key `i`, then `d` contains key `i` with a value of 1. Otherwise, `d` contains key `i` with a value greater than or equal to 2. If `i` is in `pl`, then `pl` is a list of integers that includes the first integer in the list `palka`.***
