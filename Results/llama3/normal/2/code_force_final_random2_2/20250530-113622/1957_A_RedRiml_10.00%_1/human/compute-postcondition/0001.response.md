To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `w` since it's the only variable in the loop head. The loop will execute if `w` is at least 1.

State: **`w` is at least 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100).**
