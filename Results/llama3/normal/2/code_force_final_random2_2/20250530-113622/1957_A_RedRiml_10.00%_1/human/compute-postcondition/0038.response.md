Output: **`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` contains all unique integers from the original `palka` list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in the original `palka` list, `j` is the last unique integer in `pl`. If the frequency of `j` in the original `palka` list is at least 3, then `shapes` is equal to the number of unique integers in `pl` that have a frequency of at least 3. Otherwise, `shapes` is equal to the number of unique integers in `pl` that have a frequency of at least 3 minus 1, and the number of shapes is printed.**
