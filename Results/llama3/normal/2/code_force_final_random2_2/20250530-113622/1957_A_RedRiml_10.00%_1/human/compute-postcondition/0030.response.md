The only object in the loop head is variable  j and list pl, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list pl.  If the list has at least 2 unique integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, pl contains at least 1 unique integer from the original palka list, j is the first unique integer in pl. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 unique integers and the j is the second unique integer in the list.
State: **`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` contains at least 2 unique integers from the original `palka` list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in the original `palka` list, `j` is the second unique integer in `pl`. If the frequency of `j` in the original `palka` list is at least 3, then `shapes` is 1. Otherwise, `shapes` remains 0.**
