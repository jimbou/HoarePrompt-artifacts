Postcondition: ***`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is updated to contain one more integer `i`. In all cases, `d` is updated accordingly. If `d` does not contain the key `i`, then `d[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.***
