Output State: **`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list, `pl` is a list that contains `i` and `d[i]` is either 1 or incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `pl` has been updated to include the third integer `i` from the list `palka`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `d[i]` is either 1 (if `i` was not a key in `d`) or incremented by 1 (if `i` was already a key in `d`).
