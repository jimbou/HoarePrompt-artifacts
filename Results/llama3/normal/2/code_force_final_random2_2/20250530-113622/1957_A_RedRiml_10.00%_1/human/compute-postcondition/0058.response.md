Output State: **`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list `palka`. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is a list of integers that includes the first integer in the list `palka`, the second integer in the list `palka` and the third integer in the list `palka`. If `d` does not contain key `i`, then `d` contains key `i` with a value of 2. Otherwise, `d` contains key `i` with a value greater than or equal to 3. If `i` is in `pl`, then `pl` is a list of integers that includes the first integer in the list `palka` and the third integer in the list `palka`.**

In this output state, the value of `d[i]` has been incremented by 1. If `i` was not in `d` before, it now has a value of 2. If `i` was already in `d`, its value has been increased by 1, making it at least 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
