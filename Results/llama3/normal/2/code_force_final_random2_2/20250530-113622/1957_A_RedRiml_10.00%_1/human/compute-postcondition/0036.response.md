Output State: **`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` contains all unique integers from the original `palka` list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in the original `palka` list, `j` is the last unique integer in `pl`. If the frequency of `j` in the original `palka` list is at least 3, then `shapes` is equal to the number of unique integers in `pl` that have a frequency of at least 3. Otherwise, `shapes` is equal to the number of unique integers in `pl` that have a frequency of at least 3 minus 1.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations, the state of the variables not affected by the loop remains unchanged. The loop iterates over all unique integers in `pl`, and for each integer, it checks if its frequency in the original `palka` list is at least 3. If it is, the `shapes` variable is incremented by 1. After the loop finishes, `shapes` will be equal to the number of unique integers in `pl` that have a frequency of at least 3.
