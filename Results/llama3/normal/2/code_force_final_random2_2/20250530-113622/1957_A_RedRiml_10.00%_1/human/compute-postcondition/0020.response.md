Output State: **`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list, `d[i]` is incremented by 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `w` is still at least 1, the number of test cases in `stdin` remains `t-2`, `ln` is still an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is still a list of n integers with at least 3 integers, `i` is still the third integer in the list, and the value of `d[i]` has been incremented by 1.
