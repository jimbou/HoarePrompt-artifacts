To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for j in pl:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `j` and `pl`.

According to the current state, `j` is the second unique integer in `pl`, and `pl` contains at least 2 unique integers from the original `palka` list.

For the loop to execute again, `pl` must have at least 3 unique integers, and `j` must be the third unique integer in `pl`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` contains at least 3 unique integers from the original `palka` list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in the original `palka` list, `j` is the third unique integer in `pl`. If the frequency of `j` in the original `palka` list is at least 3, then `shapes` is 2. Otherwise, `shapes` is 1.**
