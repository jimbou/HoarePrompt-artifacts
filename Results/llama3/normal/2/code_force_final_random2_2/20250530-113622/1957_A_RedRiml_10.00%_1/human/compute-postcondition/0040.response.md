Output State: **w is at least 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, ln is an integer between 1 and 100, palka is a list of integers, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary, j is undefined, shapes is undefined**

The code block reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to ln, which is now an integer between 1 and 100. It then reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to palka. The list pl and dictionary d are initialized as empty. The variable j is undefined since it was previously defined as the last unique integer in pl, but pl is now empty. The variable shapes is also undefined since its value depends on the frequency of j in the original palka list, which is no longer applicable. The value of w remains unchanged, and stdin now contains t-3 test cases.
