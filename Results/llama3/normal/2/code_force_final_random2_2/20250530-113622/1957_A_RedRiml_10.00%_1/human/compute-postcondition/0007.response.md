Output State: **`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary that contains the first integer `i` as a key with its value incremented by 1**

In this output state, the value of `d[i]` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `d` still contains the first integer `i` as a key, but its value has been increased by 1. The other variables, including `w`, `stdin`, `ln`, `palka`, and `pl`, retain their original values and properties.
