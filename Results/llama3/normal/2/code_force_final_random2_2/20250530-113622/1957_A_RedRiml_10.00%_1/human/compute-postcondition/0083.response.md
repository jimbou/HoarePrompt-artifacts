Output State: **`w` is at least 3, stdin contains t-4 test cases, ln is an integer between 1 and 100, palka is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, pl is an empty list, d is a dictionary that contains the key i with a value one more than before, j is undefined, shapes is undefined, i is the first integer in the list**

The code increments the value of `d[i]` by 1. Since `i` is the first integer in the list `palka`, the value of `d[i]` is increased by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
