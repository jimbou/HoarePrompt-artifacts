Output State: **`w` is at least 3, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` that must have at least 2 elements, `d` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers from `palka` and the values are their respective counts, `j` is the second element in `pl`. If the count of `j` in `d` is at least 3, then `shapes` is 2, otherwise `shapes` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `shapes` has been incremented by 1. If the count of `j` in `d` is at least 3, then `shapes` is now 2, otherwise `shapes` is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
