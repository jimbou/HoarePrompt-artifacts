The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and list pl, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list pl.  If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, pl has at least 1 integer, j is the first integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the j is the second integer in the list.
State: **`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list of integers that includes all unique integers from the list `palka` and has at least 2 integers, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `palka` and each value is the count of occurrences of that integer in the list `palka`, `j` is the second integer in `pl`. If the count of occurrences of `j` in `palka` is at least 3, then `shapes` is 1. Otherwise, `shapes` remains 0.**
