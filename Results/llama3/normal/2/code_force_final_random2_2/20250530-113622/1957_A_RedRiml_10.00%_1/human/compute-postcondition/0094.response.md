The only object in the loop head is variable `palka`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `palka`. If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `palka` has at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and `i` is the third integer in the list.
State: **`w` is at least 3, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `d` is a dictionary that contains the key i with a value that is 1 if i was not in d before, otherwise it is one more than the previous value, `i` is the third integer in `palka`, `j` is undefined, `shapes` is undefined. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is a list containing the first three integers in `palka`.**
