Output State: **`w` is at least 3, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `pl` is a list containing the first integer in `palka`, `d` is a dictionary that contains the key i with a value that is 1 if i was not in d before, otherwise it is one more than the previous value, `i` is the second integer in `palka`, `j` is undefined, `shapes` is undefined, and the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is the second integer in the list `palka`. The other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `d` now contains the updated value for the key `i`, which is one more than its previous value.
