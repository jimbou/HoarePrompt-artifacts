The only object in the loop head is variable  j and list pl, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list pl.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, pl has at least 2 elements, j is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the j is the third element in the list.
State: **`w` is at least 3, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` that must have at least 3 elements, `d` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers from `palka` and the values are their respective counts, `j` is the third element in `pl`. If the count of `j` in `d` is at least 3, then `shapes` is 2. Otherwise, `shapes` is 1.**
