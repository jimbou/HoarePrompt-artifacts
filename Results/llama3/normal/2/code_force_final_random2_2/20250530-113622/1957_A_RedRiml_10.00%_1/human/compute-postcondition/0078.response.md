Output State: **w is at least 3, stdin contains t-4 test cases, ln is an integer between 1 and 100, palka is a list of integers, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary, j is undefined, and shapes is undefined.**

The code executes three lines. The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to ln. Since ln was an integer between 1 and 100, it remains an integer between 1 and 100. The second line reads a list of integers from stdin, splits them into individual integers, and assigns them to palka. Since palka was an empty list, it becomes a list of integers. The third line initializes pl as an empty list and d as an empty dictionary. Since pl was a list of integers that included all unique integers from the list palka, it becomes an empty list. Since d was a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list palka and each value is the count of occurrences of that integer in the list palka, it becomes an empty dictionary. The variable j, which was the last integer in pl, becomes undefined since pl is now empty. The variable shapes, which was equal to the number of integers in pl that have a count of occurrences in palka of at least 3, also becomes undefined since pl is now empty.
