Postcondition: ***`w` is at least 3, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in `palka`, `j` is undefined, `shapes` is undefined. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is a list containing the first three integers in `palka` and `i`, and the dictionary `d` contains the key `i` with a value that is 1 if `i` was not in `d` before, otherwise it is one more than the previous value. If `i` is in `pl`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
