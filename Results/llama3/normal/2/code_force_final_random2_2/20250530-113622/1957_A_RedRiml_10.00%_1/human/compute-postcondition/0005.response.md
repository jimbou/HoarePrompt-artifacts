Output State: **`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with key `i` and value 1, `i` is the first integer in the list.**

In this output state, the value of `d` has been updated to include the key `i` with a value of 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `d` now contains the key `i`, which was not present before. The rest of the variables maintain their initial values and properties.
