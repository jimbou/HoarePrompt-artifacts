Output State: **`w` is at least 3, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in `palka`, `j` is undefined, `shapes` is undefined, `pl` is a list containing the first three integers in `palka` and `i`, `d` contains the key `i` with a value that is 1 if `i` was not in `d` before, otherwise it is one more than the previous value.**

In this output state, the list `pl` has been updated to include the third integer `i` from the list `palka`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `d` is still dependent on whether `i` was previously in `d` or not, and its value is either 1 or one more than the previous value.
