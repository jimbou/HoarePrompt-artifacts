Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: w is at least 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, ln is an integer between 1 and 100, palka is a list of integers, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary, j is undefined, shapes is undefined
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is a list of integers that includes the first integer in the list `palka` if `i` is not in `pl`, `j` is undefined, `shapes` is undefined, `i` is the first integer in the list `palka`, `d` contains key `i` with a value greater than or equal to 1 if `i` is not in `pl`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list `palka`. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is a list of integers that includes the first integer in the list `palka` and the second integer in the list `palka`. If `d` does not contain key `i`, then `d` contains key `i` with a value of 1. Otherwise, `d` contains key `i` with a value greater than or equal to 2. If `i` is in `pl`, then `pl` is a list of integers that includes the first integer in the list `palka`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list `palka`. If `d` does not contain key `i`, then `d` contains key `i` with a value of 1 and `pl` is a list of integers that includes the first integer in the list `palka`, the second integer in the list `palka` and the third integer in the list `palka` if `i` is not in `pl`, otherwise `pl` is a list of integers that includes the first integer in the list `palka`, the second integer in the list `palka` and the third integer in the list `palka` twice. If `d` contains key `i`, then `d` contains key `i` with a value greater than or equal to 2 and `pl` is a list of integers that includes the first integer in the list `palka`, the second integer in the list `palka` and the third integer in the list `palka` if `i` is not in `pl`, otherwise `pl` is a list of integers that includes the first integer in the list `palka`, the second integer in the list `palka` and the third integer in the list `palka` twice. If `i` is in `pl`, then `pl` is a list of integers that includes the first integer in the list `palka` and the third integer in the list `palka`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
