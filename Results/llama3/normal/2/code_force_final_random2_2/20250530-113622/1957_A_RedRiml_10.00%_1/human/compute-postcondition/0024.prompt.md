Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: w is at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, ln is an integer between 1 and 100, palka is a list of n integers between 1 and 100, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer. If the integer `i` is not in list `pl`, then `pl` is updated to contain `i` and dictionary `d` is updated with key `i` and value 1 if `i` was not in `d` before, otherwise the value of key `i` in dictionary `d` has been incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is updated to contain one more integer `i`. In all cases, `d` is updated accordingly. If `d` does not contain the key `i`, then `d[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list. If `i` is not in `pl`, `pl` is updated to contain `i` and `d[i]` is either 1 or incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
