Postcondition: ***`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list of integers that includes all unique integers from the list `palka` and has at least 1 integer, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `palka` and each value is the count of occurrences of that integer in the list `palka`, `j` is the first integer in `pl`. If the count of occurrences of `j` in `palka` is at least 3, then `shapes` is 1. Otherwise, `shapes` remains 0.***
