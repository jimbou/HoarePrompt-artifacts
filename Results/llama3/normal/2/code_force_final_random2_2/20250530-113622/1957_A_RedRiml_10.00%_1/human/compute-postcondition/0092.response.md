Output State: **`w` is at least 3, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `pl` is a list containing the first two integers in `palka`, `d` is a dictionary that contains the key i with a value that is 1 if i was not in d before, otherwise it is one more than the previous value, `i` is the second integer in `palka`, `j` is undefined, `shapes` is undefined.**

In this output state, the list `pl` has been updated to include the second integer `i` from the list `palka`. The other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `d` still contains the key `i` with a value that is 1 if `i` was not in `d` before, otherwise it is one more than the previous value.
