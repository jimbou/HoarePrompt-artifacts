The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `w`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. If `_` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is not specified, `w` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be 1 and `w` must be at least 2.
State: **`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` contains all unique integers from the original `palka` list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in the original `palka` list, `j` is the last unique integer in `pl`. If the frequency of `j` in the original `palka` list is at least 3, then `shapes` is equal to the number of unique integers in `pl` that have a frequency of at least 3. Otherwise, `shapes` is equal to the number of unique integers in `pl` that have a frequency of at least 3 minus 1, and the number of shapes is printed.**
