According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `palka`. If `palka` has at least 1 integer, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pl` is an empty list, and `d` is an empty dictionary. So for the loop to be executed, `palka` must have at least 1 integer and `i` is the first integer in the list.

State: **`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `i` is the first integer in the list**
