The only variable in the loop head is variable  `w`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. If `w` is at least 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `w` must be at least 3.
State: **`w` is at least 3, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list of integers that includes all unique integers from the list `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `palka` and each value is the count of occurrences of that integer in the list `palka`, `j` is the last integer in `pl`. `shapes` is equal to the number of integers in `pl` that have a count of occurrences in `palka` of at least 3, and the number of shapes is printed**
