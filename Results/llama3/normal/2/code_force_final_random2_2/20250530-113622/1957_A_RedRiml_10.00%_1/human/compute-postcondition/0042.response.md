Postcondition: **`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `j` is undefined, `shapes` is undefined, `i` is the first integer in the list. The current value of `d` does not contain the key `i` (i.e., `d.get(i)` returns `None`).**
