To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `pl`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `pl`. If `pl` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Since `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka`, we need to adjust the state of `palka` to ensure it has at least 1 element.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`w` is at least 3, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` that must have at least 1 element, `d` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers from `palka` and the values are their respective counts, `j` is the first element in `pl`, `shapes` is 0**

Note that I've adjusted the state of `palka` to ensure it has at least 1 element, which in turn ensures that `pl` has at least 1 element. I've also set `j` to be the first element in `pl`, as that's the initial value it will take when the loop starts.
