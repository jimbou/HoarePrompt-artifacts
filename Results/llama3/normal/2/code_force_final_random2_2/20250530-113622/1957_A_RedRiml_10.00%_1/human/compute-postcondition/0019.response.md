Output State: **`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list, `d[i]` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `d[i]` has been updated to 1, where `i` is the third integer in the list `palka`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `w` still being at least 1, `stdin` containing `t-2` test cases, `ln` being an integer between 1 and 100, and `palka` being a list of n integers with at least 3 integers.
