Output State: **`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, `pl` is updated accordingly, and `d[i]` is incremented by 1**

The code increments the value of `d[i]` by 1. The previous value of `d[i]` is not specified, so we can't determine its new value. However, we know that `d[i]` is updated accordingly. The other variables are not affected by the code, so their values remain the same. The output state includes all the information from the initial state, with the update that `d[i]` is incremented by 1.
