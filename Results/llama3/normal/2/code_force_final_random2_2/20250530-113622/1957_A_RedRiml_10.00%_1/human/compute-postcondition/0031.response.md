Output State: **`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` contains at least 2 unique integers from the original `palka` list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in the original `palka` list, `j` is the second unique integer in `pl`. If the frequency of `j` in the original `palka` list is at least 3, then `shapes` is 2. Otherwise, `shapes` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `shapes` has been incremented by 1. If the frequency of `j` in the original `palka` list is at least 3, then `shapes` is now 2. Otherwise, `shapes` is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
