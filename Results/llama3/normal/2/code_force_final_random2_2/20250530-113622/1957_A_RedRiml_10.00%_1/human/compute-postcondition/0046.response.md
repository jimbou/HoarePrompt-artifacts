Postcondition: ***`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is an empty list, `j` is undefined, `shapes` is undefined, `i` is the first integer in the list. If `d` does not contain key `i`, `d` is updated with key `i` and value 1. Otherwise, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.***
