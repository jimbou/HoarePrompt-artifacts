The code prints the value of `shapes`, which is determined based on the frequency of the last unique integer `j` in the original `palka` list.

If the frequency of `j` is at least 3, then `shapes` is equal to the number of unique integers in `pl` that have a frequency of at least 3.

Otherwise, `shapes` is equal to the number of unique integers in `pl` that have a frequency of at least 3 minus 1.

Output: **the number of unique integers in pl that have a frequency of at least 3, or the number of unique integers in pl that have a frequency of at least 3 minus 1, depending on the frequency of the last unique integer j in the original palka list**
