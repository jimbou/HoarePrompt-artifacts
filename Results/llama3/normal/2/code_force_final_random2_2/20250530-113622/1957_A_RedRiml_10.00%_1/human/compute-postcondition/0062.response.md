Output State: **`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list of integers that includes all unique integers from the list `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `palka` and each value is the count of occurrences of that integer in the list `palka`, `j` is undefined, `shapes` is undefined.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is as follows:

*   The value of `w` remains at least 2.
*   The `stdin` still contains `t-3` test cases.
*   The value of `ln` remains an integer between 1 and 100.
*   The list `palka` becomes empty because the loop iterates over all its elements.
*   The list `pl` contains all unique integers from the original list `palka`.
*   The dictionary `d` contains the count of occurrences of each integer from the list `palka`.
*   The variables `j` and `shapes` remain undefined.
