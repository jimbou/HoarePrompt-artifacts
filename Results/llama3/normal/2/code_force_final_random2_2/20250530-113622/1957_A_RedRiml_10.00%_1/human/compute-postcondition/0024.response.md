Output State: **`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` contains all unique integers from the original `palka` list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in the original `palka` list.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state is such that the list `palka` is empty because all its elements have been processed. The list `pl` now contains all unique integers that were present in the original `palka` list. The dictionary `d` keeps track of the frequency of each unique integer from the original `palka` list, where each key is a unique integer and its corresponding value is the number of times that integer appeared in the original `palka` list. The other variables `w`, `stdin`, and `ln` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
