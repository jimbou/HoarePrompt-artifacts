The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `palka`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `palka`. If `palka` has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `palka` has at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the `i` is the third integer in the list.
State: **`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list**
