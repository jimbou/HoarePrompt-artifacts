The only object in the loop head is variable  `i` and list `palka`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `palka`. If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `palka` has at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list `palka`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the `i` is the third integer in the list.
State: **`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list `palka`. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is a list of integers that includes the first integer in the list `palka`, the second integer in the list `palka` and the third integer in the list `palka`. If `d` does not contain key `i`, then `d` contains key `i` with a value of 1. Otherwise, `d` contains key `i` with a value greater than or equal to 2. If `i` is in `pl`, then `pl` is a list of integers that includes the first integer in the list `palka` and the third integer in the list `palka`.**
