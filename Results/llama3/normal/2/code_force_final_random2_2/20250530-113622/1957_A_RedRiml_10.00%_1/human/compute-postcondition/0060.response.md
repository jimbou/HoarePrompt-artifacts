Output State: **`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list `palka`. If `d` does not contain key `i`, then `d` contains key `i` with a value of 1 and `pl` is a list of integers that includes the first integer in the list `palka`, the second integer in the list `palka` and the third integer in the list `palka` if `i` is not in `pl`, otherwise `pl` is a list of integers that includes the first integer in the list `palka`, the second integer in the list `palka` and the third integer in the list `palka` twice. If `d` contains key `i`, then `d` contains key `i` with a value greater than or equal to 2 and `pl` is a list of integers that includes the first integer in the list `palka`, the second integer in the list `palka` and the third integer in the list `palka` if `i` is not in `pl`, otherwise `pl` is a list of integers that includes the first integer in the list `palka`, the second integer in the list `palka` and the third integer in the list `palka` twice.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `pl` now includes the third integer in the list `palka` (which is `i`) at the end, regardless of whether `d` contains key `i` or not. If `i` was already in `pl`, it is now included twice.
