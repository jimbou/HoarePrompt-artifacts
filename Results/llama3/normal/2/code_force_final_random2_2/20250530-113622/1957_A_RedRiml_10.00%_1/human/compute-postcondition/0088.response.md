To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in palka:`. The only object in the loop head is `palka`, which is a list of integers.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `palka`. If `palka` has at least one more integer, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `palka` has at least 1 integer. For the loop to execute again, `palka` must have at least 2 integers.

Since `i` is the loop variable, its value will be the next integer in `palka`. We don't know what that integer is, so we can't determine its value. However, we can say that `i` will be defined and will have a value that is the next integer in `palka`.

The other variables (`w`, `stdin`, `ln`, `pl`, `d`, `j`, and `shapes`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`w` is at least 3, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `pl` is a list containing the first integer in `palka`, `d` is a dictionary that contains the key i with a value that is 1 if i was not in d before, otherwise it is one more than the previous value, `i` is the second integer in `palka`, `j` is undefined, `shapes` is undefined**
