Output State: **w is 0, stdin is empty, ln is an integer between 1 and 100, palka is an empty list, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary, j does not exist, and shapes is 0.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop counter `w` has reached 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The input buffer `stdin` is empty, as all test cases have been processed. The variables `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, `d`, and `j` are all in their initial states, as they are reinitialized at the beginning of each iteration. The variable `shapes` is 0, as there are no more test cases to process.
