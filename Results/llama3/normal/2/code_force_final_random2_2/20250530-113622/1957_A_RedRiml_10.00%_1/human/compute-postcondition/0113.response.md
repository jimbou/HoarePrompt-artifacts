The code prints the value of `shapes`, which is determined based on the count of the last element `j` in the list `pl` and its corresponding count in the dictionary `d`.

If the count of `j` in `d` is at least 3, then `shapes` is equal to the number of elements in `pl` that have a count of at least 3 in `d`. This means that `shapes` will be the total number of elements in `pl` that appear at least three times in the original list `palka`.

On the other hand, if the count of `j` in `d` is less than 3, then `shapes` is equal to the number of elements in `pl` that have a count of at least 3 in `d` minus 1. This means that `shapes` will be the total number of elements in `pl` that appear at least three times in the original list `palka`, minus one.

Since the exact values of `palka` and `pl` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `shapes`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `shapes` based on the conditions described above.

Output: **the number of elements in pl that have a count of at least 3 in d, or the number of elements in pl that have a count of at least 3 in d minus 1, depending on the count of j in d**
