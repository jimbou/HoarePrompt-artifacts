Output State: **`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list of integers that includes all unique integers from the list `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `palka` and each value is the count of occurrences of that integer in the list `palka`, `j` is the last integer in `pl`. `shapes` is equal to the number of integers in `pl` that have a count of occurrences in `palka` of at least 3.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `w`, `stdin`, `ln`, `palka`, and `d` remain unchanged. The variable `j` is now the last integer in the list `pl`. The variable `shapes` has been incremented by 1 for each integer in `pl` that appears at least 3 times in `palka`.
