Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of times the loop executes, stdin contains multiple test cases minus the number of times the loop executes, `a` is a list of floats that must have at least n+3 elements, `b` is a list containing two zeros and 2*(n+1) additional elements, `u` is truthy and is equal to the first value returned by the function r(), `v` is y minus x, `w` is the (n+1)th element of the list a, `x` is the (n+2)th element of the list a, `y` is the (n+3)th element of the list a, `z` is the (n+4)th element of the list a, `c` and `d` are the values returned by the function r().
Code of the loop:
while u:
    u -= 1
    c, d = r()
    if c < d:
        print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
    else:
        print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of times the loop executes, stdin contains multiple test cases minus the number of times the loop executes, a is a list of floats that must have at least n+3 elements, b is a list containing two zeros and 2*(n+1) additional elements, u is falsy and is equal to the first value returned by the function r() minus 1, v is y minus x, w is the (n+1)th element of the list a, x is the (n+2)th element of the list a, y is the (n+3)th element of the list a, z is the (n+4)th element of the list a, c and d are the values returned by the function r(). If c is less than d, the difference between the (2*(d-1))th element of the list b and the (2*(c-1))th element of the list b is printed. If c is greater than or equal to d, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element of the list b and the (2*d - 1)th element of the list b is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of times the loop executes, stdin contains multiple test cases minus the number of times the loop executes, a is a list of floats that must have at least n+3 elements, b is a list containing two zeros and 2*(n+1) additional elements, u is truthy and is equal to the first value returned by the function r() minus 2, v is y minus x, w is the (n+1)th element of the list a, x is the (n+2)th element of the list a, y is the (n+3)th element of the list a, z is the (n+4)th element of the list a, c and d are the values returned by the function r(). If c is less than d, the difference between the (2*(d-1))th and (2*(c-1))th elements of the list b is being printed. Otherwise, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th and (2*d - 1)th elements of the list b is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of times the loop executes, stdin contains multiple test cases minus the number of times the loop executes, a is a list of floats that must have at least n+3 elements, b is a list containing two zeros and 2*(n+1) additional elements, u is truthy and is equal to the first value returned by the function r() minus 3 and the first value returned by the function r() must be greater than 2, v is y minus x, w is the (n+1)th element of the list a, x is the (n+2)th element of the list a, y is the (n+3)th element of the list a, z is the (n+4)th element of the list a, c and d are the values returned by the function r(). If c is less than d, the difference between the (2*(d-1))th element of the list b and the (2*(c-1))th element of the list b is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element and the (2*d - 1)th element of the list b is printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
