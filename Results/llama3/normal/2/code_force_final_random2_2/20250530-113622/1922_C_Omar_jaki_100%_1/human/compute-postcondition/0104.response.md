Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of four inputs: a positive integer, a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, another positive integer, and a list of pairs of distinct positive integers. The function calculates and prints the differences between specific elements in a list based on the input pairs, following certain conditions. It continues processing test cases until all input has been consumed, leaving the standard input empty.**
