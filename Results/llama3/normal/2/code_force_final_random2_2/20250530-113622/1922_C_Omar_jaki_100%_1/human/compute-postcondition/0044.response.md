Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of times the loop executes, stdin contains multiple test cases minus the number of times the loop executes, `a` is a list of floats that must have at least n+3 elements, `b` is a list containing two zeros and 2*(n+1) additional elements, `u` is truthy and is equal to the first value returned by the function r(), `v` is y minus x, `w` is the (n+1)th element of the list a, `x` is the (n+2)th element of the list a, `y` is the (n+3)th element of the list a, `z` is the (n+4)th element of the list a, `c` and `d` are the values returned by the function r().**

In this output state, the value of `u` has changed to be truthy and is equal to the first value returned by the function r(). The other variables remain unchanged.
