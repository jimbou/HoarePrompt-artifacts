Output State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a is a list of floats that must have at least 5 elements, b is a list containing two zeros and four additional elements, the first additional element is the last element of the original b plus v to the power of a boolean expression that evaluates to True if v is greater than x minus w, the second additional element is the last element of the original b plus v to the power of a boolean expression that evaluates to True if v is greater than z minus y, the third additional element is the last element of the original b plus v to the power of a boolean expression that evaluates to True if v is greater than x minus w, the fourth additional element is the last element of the original b plus v to the power of a boolean expression that evaluates to True if v is greater than z minus y, v is y minus x.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The number of test cases in `stdin` also remains the same. The list `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `b` is modified by appending two new elements. The first new element is the last element of the original `b` plus `v` to the power of a boolean expression that evaluates to True if `v` is greater than `x` minus `w`. The second new element is the last element of the original `b` plus `v` to the power of a boolean expression that evaluates to True if `v` is greater than `z` minus `y`. The value of `v` is updated to be `y` minus `x`.
