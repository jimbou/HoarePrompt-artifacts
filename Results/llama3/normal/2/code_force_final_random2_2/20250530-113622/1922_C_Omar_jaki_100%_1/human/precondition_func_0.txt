stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer, then a list of integers, then another integer, and finally a list of pairs of integers. The first integer is a positive integer. The list of integers is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order. The second integer is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the list of integers. The list of pairs of integers contains pairs of distinct positive integers that are less than or equal to the length of the list of integers.
