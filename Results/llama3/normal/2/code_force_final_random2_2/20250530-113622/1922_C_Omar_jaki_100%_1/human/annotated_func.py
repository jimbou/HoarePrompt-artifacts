#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer, then a list of integers, then another integer, and finally a list of pairs of integers. The first integer is a positive integer. The list of integers is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order. The second integer is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the list of integers. The list of pairs of integers contains pairs of distinct positive integers that are less than or equal to the length of the list of integers.
    r = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = r()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        r()
        
        a = -1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0
        
        b = [0, 0]
        
        for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
            v = y - x
            b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
        
        u, = r()
        
        while u:
            u -= 1
            c, d = r()
            if c < d:
                print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
            else:
                print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
        
    #State: t is zero, stdin is empty, a is a list of floats that must have at least n+3 elements, b is a list containing two zeros and 2*n additional elements, u is falsy, v is y minus x, w is the (n+1)th element of the list a, x is the (n+2)th element of the list a, y is the (n+3)th element of the list a, z is the (n+4)th element of the list a, c and d are the values returned by the function r(). If c is less than d, the difference between the (2*d - 2)th element of the list b and the (2*c - 2)th element of the list b is printed. If c is not less than d, the difference between the (2*c-1)th element of the list b and the (2*d-1)th element of the list b is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of four inputs: a positive integer, a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, another positive integer, and a list of pairs of distinct positive integers. The function calculates and prints the differences between specific elements in a list based on the input pairs, following certain conditions. It continues processing test cases until all input has been consumed, leaving the standard input empty.
