stdin contains a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n, a list of n unique integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n in ascending order, an integer m, and m pairs of integers x_i and y_i. The integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n represent the coordinates of cities on the number line, and x_i and y_i represent the source and destination cities for each query. The input is well-formed and satisfies the constraints specified in the problem description.
