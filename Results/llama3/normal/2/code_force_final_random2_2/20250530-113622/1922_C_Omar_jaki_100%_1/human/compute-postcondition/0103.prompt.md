Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains three inputs: a list of integers, an integer, and a list of pairs of integers. The list of integers is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order. The integer is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the list of integers. The list of pairs of integers contains pairs of distinct positive integers that are less than or equal to the length of the list of integers.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    r()
    a = -1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0
    b = [0, 0]
    for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
        v = y - x
        b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
    u, = r()
    while u:
        u -= 1
        c, d = r()
        if c < d:
            print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
        else:
            print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of times the loop executes, stdin contains multiple test cases minus the number of times the loop executes, a is a list of floats that must have at least n+3 elements, b is a list containing two zeros and 2*n additional elements, u is falsy, v is y minus x, w is the (n+1)th element of the list a, x is the (n+2)th element of the list a, y is the (n+3)th element of the list a, z is the (n+4)th element of the list a, c and d are the values returned by the function r(). If c is less than d, the difference between the (2*d - 2)th element of the list b and the (2*c - 2)th element of the list b is printed. If c is not less than d, the difference between the (2*c-1)th element of the list b and the (2*d-1)th element of the list b is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of times the loop executes, stdin contains multiple test cases minus the number of times the loop executes, a is a list of floats that must have at least n+3 elements, b is a list containing two zeros and 2*(n+1) additional elements, u is falsy and is equal to the first value returned by the function r() minus the number of times the loop executes, v is y minus x, w is the (n+1)th element of the list a, x is the (n+2)th element of the list a, y is the (n+3)th element of the list a, z is the (n+4)th element of the list a, c and d are the values returned by the function r(). If c is less than d, the difference between the (2*(d-1))th element of the list b and the (2*(c-1))th element of the list b is printed. If c is greater than or equal to d, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element of the list b and the (2*d - 1)th element of the list b is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: The loop has finished executing, and the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that the loop has executed the specified number of times.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
