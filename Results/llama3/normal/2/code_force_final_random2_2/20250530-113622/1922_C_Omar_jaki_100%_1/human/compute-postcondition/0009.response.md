Output State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a is a list of floats that must have at least n+3 elements where n is the number of iterations of the loop, b is a list containing two zeros and 2*n additional elements, the first additional element is the last element of the original b plus v to the power of a boolean expression that evaluates to True if v is greater than x minus w, the second additional element is the last element of the original b plus v to the power of a boolean expression that evaluates to True if v is greater than z minus y, the third additional element is the last element of the original b plus v to the power of a boolean expression that evaluates to True if v is greater than x minus w, the fourth additional element is the last element of the original b plus v to the power of a boolean expression that evaluates to True if v is greater than z minus y, and so on, v is y minus x, w is the (n+1)th element of the list a, x is the (n+2)th element of the list a, y is the (n+3)th element of the list a, z is the (n+4)th element of the list a.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `a` must have at least `n+3` elements where `n` is the number of iterations of the loop, and the list `b` will have `2*n` additional elements, each of which is the last element of the original `b` plus `v` to the power of a boolean expression that evaluates to True if `v` is greater than `x` minus `w` or `z` minus `y`. The values of `v`, `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are updated in each iteration, with `v` being the difference between `y` and `x`, and `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` being the `(n+1)th`, `(n+2)th`, `(n+3)th`, and `(n+4)th` elements of the list `a` respectively.
