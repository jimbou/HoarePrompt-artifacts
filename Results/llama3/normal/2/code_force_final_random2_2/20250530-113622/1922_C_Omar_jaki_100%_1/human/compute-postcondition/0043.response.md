Output State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of times the loop executes, stdin contains multiple test cases minus the number of times the loop executes, a is a list of floats that must have at least n+3 elements, b is a list containing two zeros and 2*(n+1) additional elements, u is falsy, v is y minus x, w is the (n+1)th element of the list a, x is the (n+2)th element of the list a, y is the (n+3)th element of the list a, z is the (n+4)th element of the list a, c and d are the values returned by the function r().**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of t has decreased by the number of times the loop executed, the number of test cases in stdin has also decreased by the same amount, and the list a still has at least n+3 elements. The list b now contains two zeros and 2*(n+1) additional elements, which were appended during the loop iterations. The values of u, v, w, x, y, z, c, and d remain unchanged, with v still being the difference between y and x, and w, x, y, and z being the (n+1)th, (n+2)th, (n+3)th, and (n+4)th elements of list a, respectively.
