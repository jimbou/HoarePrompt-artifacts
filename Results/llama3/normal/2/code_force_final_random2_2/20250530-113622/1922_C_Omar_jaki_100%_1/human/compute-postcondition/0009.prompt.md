Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains three inputs: a list of integers, an integer, and a list of pairs of integers. The list of integers is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order. The integer is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the list of integers. The list of pairs of integers contains pairs of distinct positive integers that are less than or equal to the length of the list of integers. a is a list of floats, b is a list containing two zeros.
Code of the loop:
for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    v = y - x
    b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a is a list of floats that must have at least 4 elements, b is a list containing two zeros and two additional elements, the first additional element is the last element of b plus v to the power of a boolean expression that evaluates to True if v is greater than x minus w, the second additional element is the last element of b plus v to the power of a boolean expression that evaluates to True if v is greater than z minus y.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a is a list of floats that must have at least 5 elements, b is a list containing two zeros and four additional elements, the first additional element is the last element of the original b plus v to the power of a boolean expression that evaluates to True if v is greater than x minus w, the second additional element is the last element of the original b plus v to the power of a boolean expression that evaluates to True if v is greater than z minus y, the third additional element is the last element of the original b plus v to the power of a boolean expression that evaluates to True if v is greater than x minus w, the fourth additional element is the last element of the original b plus v to the power of a boolean expression that evaluates to True if v is greater than z minus y, v is y minus x.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a is a list of floats that must have at least 6 elements, b is a list containing two zeros and six additional elements, the first additional element is the last element of the original b plus v to the power of a boolean expression that evaluates to True if v is greater than x minus w, the second additional element is the last element of the original b plus v to the power of a boolean expression that evaluates to True if v is greater than z minus y, the third additional element is the last element of the original b plus v to the power of a boolean expression that evaluates to True if v is greater than x minus w, the fourth additional element is the last element of the original b plus v to the power of a boolean expression that evaluates to True if v is greater than z minus y, the fifth additional element is the last element of the original b plus v to the power of a boolean expression that evaluates to True if v is greater than x minus w, the sixth additional element is the last element of the original b plus v to the power of a boolean expression that evaluates to True if v is greater than z minus y, v is y minus x, w is the second element of the list a, x is the third element of the list a, y is the fourth element of the list a, z is the fifth element of the list a




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
