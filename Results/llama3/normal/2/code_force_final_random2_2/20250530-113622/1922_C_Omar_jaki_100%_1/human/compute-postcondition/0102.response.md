Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that the loop has executed the specified number of times.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has completed its execution, and the output state is identical to the initial state, with the only change being that the loop has run the specified number of times. The values of the variables not affected by the loop head and body remain unchanged.
