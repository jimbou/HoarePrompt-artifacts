Output State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of times the loop executes, stdin contains multiple test cases minus the number of times the loop executes, a is a list of floats that must have at least n+3 elements, b is a list containing two zeros and 2*(n+1) additional elements, u is falsy and is equal to the first value returned by the function r() minus the number of times the loop executes, v is y minus x, w is the (n+1)th element of the list a, x is the (n+2)th element of the list a, y is the (n+3)th element of the list a, z is the (n+4)th element of the list a, c and d are the values returned by the function r(). If c is less than d, the difference between the (2*(d-1))th element of the list b and the (2*(c-1))th element of the list b is printed. If c is greater than or equal to d, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element of the list b and the (2*d - 1)th element of the list b is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The variable `u` is now falsy, indicating that the loop has completed its execution. The variables `c` and `d` hold the values returned by the function `r()` during the last iteration of the loop. The differences between the appropriate elements of the list `b` have been printed according to the conditions in the loop body. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
