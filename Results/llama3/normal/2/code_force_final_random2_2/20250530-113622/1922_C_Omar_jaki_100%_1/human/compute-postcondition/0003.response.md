To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the lists `a`, `a[1:]`, `a[2:]`, and `a[3:]`. The loop will execute if `a` has at least 4 elements, since `zip` will stop when the shortest input iterable is exhausted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `a` is a list of floats that must have at least 4 elements, `b` is a list containing two zeros**
