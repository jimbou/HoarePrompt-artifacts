Output State: **t is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains three inputs: a list of integers, an integer, and a list of pairs of integers. The list of integers is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order. The integer is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the list of integers. The list of pairs of integers contains pairs of distinct positive integers that are less than or equal to the length of the list of integers.**

Explanation: The code defines a lambda function `r` that reads a line from stdin, splits it into integers, and returns them as a map. Then, it calls this function to read the first integer `t` from stdin. Since `t` is a positive integer, it represents the number of test cases. After reading `t`, stdin contains the remaining test cases, each consisting of three inputs: a list of integers, an integer, and a list of pairs of integers. The properties of these inputs remain the same as specified in the initial state.
