Postcondition: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of times the loop executes, stdin contains multiple test cases minus the number of times the loop executes, a is a list of floats that must have at least n+3 elements, b is a list containing two zeros and 2*(n+1) additional elements, u is falsy and is equal to the first value returned by the function r() minus 1, v is y minus x, w is the (n+1)th element of the list a, x is the (n+2)th element of the list a, y is the (n+3)th element of the list a, z is the (n+4)th element of the list a, c and d are the values returned by the function r(). If c is less than d, the difference between the (2*(d-1))th element of the list b and the (2*(c-1))th element of the list b is printed. If c is greater than or equal to d, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element of the list b and the (2*d - 1)th element of the list b is printed.**
