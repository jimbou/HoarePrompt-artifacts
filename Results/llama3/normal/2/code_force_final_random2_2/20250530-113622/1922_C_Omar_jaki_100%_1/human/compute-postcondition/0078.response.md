Output State: **t is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus the number of times the loop executes, a is a list of floats that must have at least n+3 elements, with the first element being -1000000000.0, the last element being 2000000000.0, and the middle elements being the values returned by the function r() minus the number of times the loop executes minus 1, b is a list containing 2n+2 elements: two zeros, b[-2] + v repeated n times, u is the first value returned by the function r() minus the number of times the loop executes, v is y minus x, w is the (n+1)th element of the list a, x is the (n+2)th element of the list a, y is the (n+3)th element of the list a, z is the (n+4)th element of the list a, c and d are the values returned by the function r(), and u has been returned by the function r().**

In this output state, the value of u has been updated to be the first value returned by the function r() minus the number of times the loop executes. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
