The code prints the difference between the (2*(d-1))th element of the list b and the (2*(c-1))th element of the list b if c is less than d, otherwise the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element of the list b and the (2*d - 1)th element of the list b.
Output: **the difference between the (2*(d-1))th element of the list b and the (2*(c-1))th element of the list b if c is less than d, otherwise the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element of the list b and the (2*d - 1)th element of the list b**
