Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of times the loop executes, stdin contains multiple test cases minus the number of times the loop executes, a is a list of floats that must have at least n+3 elements, b is a list containing two zeros, u is falsy, v is y minus x, w is the (n+1)th element of the list a, x is the (n+2)th element of the list a, y is the (n+3)th element of the list a, z is the (n+4)th element of the list a, c and d are the values returned by the function r().
Code of the loop:
for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    v = y - x
    b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of times the loop executes, stdin contains multiple test cases minus the number of times the loop executes, a is a list of floats that must have at least 4 elements, b is a list containing two zeros and two additional elements, u is falsy, v is y minus x, w is the first element of the list a, x is the second element of the list a, y is the third element of the list a, z is the fourth element of the list a, c and d are the values returned by the function r().

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of times the loop executes, stdin contains multiple test cases minus the number of times the loop executes, a is a list of floats that must have at least 5 elements, b is a list containing two zeros and two additional elements, u is falsy, v is y minus x, w is the second element of the list a, x is the third element of the list a, y is the fourth element of the list a, z is the fifth element of the list a, c and d are the values returned by the function r(), b has two additional elements appended to it, the first additional element is b[-2] plus v to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than x minus w, the second additional element is b[-1] plus v to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than z minus y.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of times the loop executes, stdin contains multiple test cases minus the number of times the loop executes, a is a list of floats that must have at least 6 elements, b is a list containing two zeros and four additional elements, u is falsy, v is y minus x, w is the third element of the list a, x is the fourth element of the list a, y is the fifth element of the list a, z is the sixth element of the list a, c and d are the values returned by the function r(), the first additional element of b is b[-2] plus v to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than x minus w, the second additional element of b is b[-1] plus v to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than z minus y.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
