Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `a` is a list of floats that must have at least `n+3` elements, `b` is a list containing two zeros and `2*n` additional elements, `u` is the first element of the `r()` function call, `v` is `y` minus `x`, `w` is the (`n+1`)th element of the list `a`, `x` is the (`n+2`)th element of the list `a`, `y` is the (`n+3`)th element of the list `a`, `z` is the (`n+4`)th element of the list `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` has decreased by 1, and one test case has been consumed from the input. The list `a` remains unchanged, but its elements are used to calculate the values of `v`, `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`. The list `b` also remains unchanged. The variable `u` is assigned the first element of the `r()` function call. The values of `v`, `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are calculated based on the elements of list `a`.
