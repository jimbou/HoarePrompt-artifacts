Output State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of times the loop executes, stdin contains multiple test cases minus the number of times the loop executes, a is a list of floats that must have at least n+3 elements, b is a list containing two zeros and 2*(n+1) additional elements, u is falsy and is equal to the first value returned by the function r() minus 1, v is y minus x, w is the (n+1)th element of the list a, x is the (n+2)th element of the list a, y is the (n+3)th element of the list a, z is the (n+4)th element of the list a, c and d are the values returned by the function r().**

The first line decrements the value of `u` by 1, making it falsy. The second line assigns the values returned by the function `r()` to `c` and `d`, respectively. No other variables are affected.
