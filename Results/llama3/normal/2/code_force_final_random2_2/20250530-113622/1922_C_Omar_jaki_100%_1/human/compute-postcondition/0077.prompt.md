Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus the number of times the loop executes, a is a list of floats that must have at least n+3 elements, with the first element being -1000000000.0, the last element being 2000000000.0, and the middle elements being the values returned by the function r() minus the number of times the loop executes, b is a list containing two zeros, u is falsy and is equal to the first value returned by the function r() minus the number of times the loop executes minus 1, v is y minus x, w is the (n+1)th element of the list a, x is the (n+2)th element of the list a, y is the (n+3)th element of the list a, z is the (n+4)th element of the list a, c and d are the values returned by the function r().
Code of the loop:
for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    v = y - x
    b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus the number of times the loop executes, a is a list of floats that must have at least n+4 elements, with the first element being -1000000000.0, the last element being 2000000000.0, and the middle elements being the values returned by the function r() minus the number of times the loop executes, b is a list containing four elements: two zeros, b[-2] + v

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus the number of times the loop executes, a is a list of floats that must have at least n+5 elements, with the first element being -1000000000.0, the last element being 2000000000.0, and the middle elements being the values returned by the function r() minus the number of times the loop executes plus one, b is a list containing six elements: two zeros, b[-2] + v, b[-2] + v

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 0 minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus the number of times the loop executes, a is a list of floats that must have at least n+9 elements, with the first element being -1000000000.0, the last element being 2000000000.0, and the middle elements being the values returned by the function r() minus the number of times the loop executes plus 5, b is a list containing eight elements: two zeros, b[-2] + v, b[-2] + v, b[-2] + v




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
