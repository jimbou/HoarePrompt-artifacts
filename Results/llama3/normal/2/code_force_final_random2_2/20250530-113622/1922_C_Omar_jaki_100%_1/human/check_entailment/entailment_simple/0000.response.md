Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the coordinates of the cities `a`, and the number of queries `m`.

3. It then constructs a list `b` where `b[i * 2]` is the minimum cost to travel from city 1 to city `i` and `b[i * 2 + 1]` is the minimum cost to travel from city `i` to city 1.

4. The program then iterates over each query. For each query, it reads the source city `c` and the destination city `d`.

5. If `c` is less than `d`, it prints the difference between `b[(d - 1) * 2]` and `b[(c - 1) * 2]`, which is the minimum cost to travel from city `c` to city `d`.

6. If `c` is not less than `d`, it prints the difference between `b[c * 2 - 1]` and `b[d * 2 - 1]`, which is the minimum cost to travel from city `c` to city `d`.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. The use of the list `b` to store the minimum costs to travel between cities is efficient and allows the program to answer queries in constant time.

Correctness: **True**
