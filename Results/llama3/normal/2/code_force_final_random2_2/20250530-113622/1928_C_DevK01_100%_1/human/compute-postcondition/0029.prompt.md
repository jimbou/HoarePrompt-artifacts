Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is 1, If the square root of `q` is an integer and is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then `M` is a list containing the square root of `q`. Otherwise, `M` remains an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while i < w:
    if q % i == 0:
        if i >= x - 1:
            M += [i]
        if q // i >= x - 1:
            M += [q // i]
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `w` is greater than 1. If `q` is divisible by `i` and the integer division of `q` by `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then `M` is a list containing the square root of `q`, `i`, and `q // i`. Otherwise, the value of `M` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is greater than `i`. If `q` is divisible by `i`, then if `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1 and `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, `M` is a list containing the integers `i` and `q // i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1 and `q // i` is less than `x` - 1, `M` is a list containing the integer `i`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is greater than or equal to 4, `w` is greater than `i`. If `q` is divisible by `i`, then `M` is a list that includes `i` and `q // i` if `i` is greater than or equal to `x` minus 1 and `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x` minus 1. Otherwise, `M` does not include `q // i`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
