Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is greater than or equal to 4, `w` is greater than `i`. If `q` is divisible by `i`, then `M` is a list that includes `i` and `q // i` if `i` is greater than or equal to `x` minus 1 and `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x` minus 1. Otherwise, `M` does not include `q // i`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now greater than or equal to 4. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `M` to include `q // i` are still dependent on the values of `q`, `i`, and `x`, but the increment of `i` may affect whether `i` is greater than or equal to `x` minus 1.
