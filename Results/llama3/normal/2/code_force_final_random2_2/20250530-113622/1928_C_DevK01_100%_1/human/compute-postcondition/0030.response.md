Output State: **The program returns a list M. If the square root of q is an integer and is greater than or equal to x - 1, then M contains the square root of q, which is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to the square root of 10^9. Otherwise, M contains all integers i such that i is greater than or equal to x - 1 (where x is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than q) and q is divisible by i.**
