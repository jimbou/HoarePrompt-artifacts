Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is equal to `w`, `w` is greater than or equal to 1. If the square root of `q` is an integer and is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then `M` is a list containing the square root of `q`. Otherwise, `M` is a list containing all integers `i` such that `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1 and `q` is divisible by `i`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The value of `q` remains unchanged, within the range of 1 to 10^9.
- The value of `x` remains unchanged, within the range of 1 to `q` - 1.
- The value of `i` is equal to `w`, indicating that the loop has executed `w` times.
- The value of `w` remains unchanged, greater than or equal to 1.
- The list `M` contains the square root of `q` if it is an integer and greater than or equal to `x` - 1. Otherwise, `M` contains all integers `i` that are greater than or equal to `x` - 1 and are divisors of `q`.
