The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `w`, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `w`.  If `i` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than or equal to 3 and `w` is greater than `i`. `w` being greater than `i` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `w` is greater than `i` and `i` is greater than or equal to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is greater than `i`**
