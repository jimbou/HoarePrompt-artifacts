Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `w` is greater than `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then `M` is a list that contains the integer `i` and `q // i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `q`, `x`, `i`, and `w` remains the same as in the initial state. The list `M` is updated to include the integer `q // i` in addition to its previous value, which was `i` if `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1.
