Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is greater than `i`, `M` is a list that includes `i`**

In this output state, the values of `q`, `x`, `i`, and `w` remain unchanged. The only change is that the list `M` now includes the value of `i`, which is greater than or equal to 3.
