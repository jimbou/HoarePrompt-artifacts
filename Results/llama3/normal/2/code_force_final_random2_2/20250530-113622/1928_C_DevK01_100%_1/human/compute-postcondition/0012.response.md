Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than 1, `q` is divisible by `i`. If the integer division of `q` by `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then `M` is a list containing the square root of `q`, `i`, and `q // i`. Otherwise, the value of `M` remains unchanged***
