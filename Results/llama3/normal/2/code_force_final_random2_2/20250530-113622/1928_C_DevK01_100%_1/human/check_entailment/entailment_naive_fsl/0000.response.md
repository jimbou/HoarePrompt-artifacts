Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of different k that fit under the given constraints. It first checks if the sum of the position and the number is even, and if not, it prints 0. Then, it calculates the possible values of k using the function func_1, which finds the factors of a given number. The program also checks if the position is greater than or equal to 3 times the number minus 2, and if so, it adds more possible values of k. Finally, it prints the number of unique possible values of k.

The program correctly handles all the edge cases, including when the position is 1, when the number is 1, and when the position is greater than or equal to 3 times the number minus 2. It also correctly handles the case when the sum of the position and the number is odd.

The program is also efficient, as it uses a set to store the possible values of k, which automatically removes duplicates. It also uses a while loop to find the factors of a number, which is more efficient than using a for loop.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it correctly implements the logic to find the number of different k that fit under the given constraints.
