Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is 1, If the square root of `q` is an integer and is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then `M` is a list containing the square root of `q`. Otherwise, `M` remains an empty list.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` is now 1. The values of `q` and `x` remain the same, with `q` being an integer between 1 and 10^9, and `x` being an integer between 1 and `q`. The list `M` still depends on the relationship between the square root of `q` and `x`, and its value is determined by this condition.
