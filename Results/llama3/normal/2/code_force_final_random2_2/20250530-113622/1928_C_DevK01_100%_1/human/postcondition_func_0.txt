This function takes two integers, q and x, as input, where 1 <= x < q <= 10^9, and returns a list M containing divisors of q that are greater than or equal to x - 1. If the square root of q is an integer and is greater than or equal to x - 1, the list contains only the square root of q. Otherwise, the list contains all integers i such that i is greater than or equal to x - 1 and q is divisible by i.
