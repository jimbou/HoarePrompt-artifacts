Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `w` is greater than `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1 and `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then `M` is a list that contains the integer `i` and `q // i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1 and `q // i` is less than `x` - 1, then `M` is a list that contains the integer `i`.***
