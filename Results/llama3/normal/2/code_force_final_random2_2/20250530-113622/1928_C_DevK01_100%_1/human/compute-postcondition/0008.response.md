Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is an integer greater than or equal to `x` - 1, `M` is a list containing the square root of `q` (if it is an integer and greater than or equal to `x` - 1) and `i`, `w` is greater than 1, and `q` is divisible by `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been updated to include the current value of `i`, in addition to its previous value (which was either an empty list or a list containing the square root of `q`). The other variables remain unchanged.
