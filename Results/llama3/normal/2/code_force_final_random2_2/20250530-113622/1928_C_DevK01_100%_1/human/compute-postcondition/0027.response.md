Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is greater than `i`. If `q` is divisible by `i`, then `M` is a list that includes `i` and `q // i` if `i` is greater than or equal to `x` minus 1 and `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x` minus 1. Otherwise, `M` does not include `q // i`.***
