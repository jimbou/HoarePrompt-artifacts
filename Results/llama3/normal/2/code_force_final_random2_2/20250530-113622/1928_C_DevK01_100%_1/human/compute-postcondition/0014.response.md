Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `w` is greater than 1. If `q` is divisible by `i` and the integer division of `q` by `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then `M` is a list containing the square root of `q`, `i`, and `q // i`. Otherwise, the value of `M` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now greater than or equal to 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `M` still depends on the values of `q`, `i`, and `x`, but the possible values of `i` have been updated to reflect the increment.
