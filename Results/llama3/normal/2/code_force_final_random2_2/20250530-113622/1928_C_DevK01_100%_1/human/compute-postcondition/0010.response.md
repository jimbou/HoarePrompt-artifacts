Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. The current value of `M` is either a list containing the square root of `q` and `i` if the square root of `q` is an integer and is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, or an empty list otherwise. `w` is greater than 1. Additionally, `q` is divisible by `i`. The integer division of `q` by `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1.***
