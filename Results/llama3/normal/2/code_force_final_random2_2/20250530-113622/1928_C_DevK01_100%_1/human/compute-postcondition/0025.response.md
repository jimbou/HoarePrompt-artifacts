Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is greater than `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x` minus 1, then `M` is a list that includes `i` and `q // i`.**

In this output state, the values of `q`, `x`, `i`, and `w` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is in the list `M`, which now includes the value `q // i` in addition to the value `i` if `i` is greater than or equal to `x` minus 1.
