Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is greater than `i`. If `q` is divisible by `i`, then if `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1 and `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, `M` is a list containing the integers `i` and `q // i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1 and `q // i` is less than `x` - 1, `M` is a list containing the integer `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now greater than or equal to 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `M` are still dependent on the values of `q`, `x`, and `i`, but the possible values of `i` have shifted by 1.
