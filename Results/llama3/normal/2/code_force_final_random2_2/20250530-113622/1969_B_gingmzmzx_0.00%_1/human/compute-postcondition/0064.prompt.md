Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, s is a list of integers, zeroes is equal to the number of zeroes in the list s, cnt is a list containing two integers where cnt[0] is equal to the number of zeroes in the list s and cnt[1] is equal to the number of ones in the list s, stdin contains n-5 lines, each containing a binary string, ans is equal to the number of ones in the list s times the number of zeroes in the list s.
Code of the loop:
for c in s:
    cnt[c] += 1
    if c == 0:
        ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
    else:
        ans += zeroes - cnt[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `c` is the first integer in the list `s`, `zeroes` is equal to the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where `cnt[0]` is equal to the number of zeroes in the list `s` and `cnt[1]` is equal to the number of ones in the list `s` plus one if `c` is 1, `ans` is equal to the number of ones in the list `s` times the number of zeroes in the list `s` plus one if the number of ones in the list `s` plus one if `c` is 1 is greater than 0 and `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is equal to the number of ones in the list `s` times the number of zeroes in the list `s` plus the difference between the number of zeroes in the list `s` and the number of zeroes in the list `s`, stdin contains `n-5` lines, each containing a binary string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `c` is the second integer in the list `s`, `zeroes` is equal to the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where `cnt[0]` is equal to the number of zeroes in the list `s` and `cnt[1]` is equal to the number of ones in the list `s` plus two if `c` is 1, `ans` is equal to the number of ones in the list `s` times the number of zeroes in the list `s` plus one if the number of ones in the list `s` plus two if `c` is 1 is greater than 0 and `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is equal to the number of ones in the list `s` times the number of zeroes in the list `s` plus the difference between the number of zeroes in the list `s` and the number of zeroes in the list `s` plus 1 if `c` is 1, stdin contains `n-5` lines, each containing a binary string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `c` is the third integer in the list `s`, `zeroes` is equal to the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where `cnt[0]` is equal to the number of zeroes in the list `s` and `cnt[1]` is equal to the number of ones in the list `s` plus two if `c` is 1 plus one, `ans` is equal to the number of ones in the list `s` times the number of zeroes in the list `s` plus one if the number of ones in the list `s` plus two if `c` is 1 is greater than 0 and `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is equal to the number of ones in the list `s` times the number of zeroes in the list `s` plus the difference between the number of zeroes in the list `s` and the number of zeroes in the list `s` plus 1 if `c` is 1 plus 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, stdin contains `n-5` lines, each containing a binary string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
