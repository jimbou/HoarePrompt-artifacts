Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `s` is a list of integers representing a binary string that must have at least 2 integers, `c` is the second integer in the list, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of zeroes in `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where `cnt[c]` is increased by 1, `cnt[0]` is either `zeroes` or `zeroes+1` and `cnt[1]` is either 0 or 1, If `c` is 0, `ans` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `cnt[1]` is greater than 0 or not. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0] + 1`. `stdin` contains `n-1` lines, each containing a binary string.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated based on the condition `cnt[1] > 0`. If `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, `ans` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
