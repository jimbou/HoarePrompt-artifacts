Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains n lines, each containing a binary string s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5).**

In this output state, the value of `n` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4. The stdin now contains n lines, each containing a binary string s, where the length of s is between 2 and 2 * 10^5.
