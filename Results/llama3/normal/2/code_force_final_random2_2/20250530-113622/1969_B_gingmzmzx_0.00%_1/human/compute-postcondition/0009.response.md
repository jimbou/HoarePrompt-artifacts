Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `s` is a list of integers representing a binary string that must have at least 1 integer, `c` is the first integer in the list, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of zeroes in `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where `cnt[c]` is increased by 1. If `c` is 0, `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `cnt[1]` is greater than 0 or not. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`. `stdin` contains `n-1` lines, each containing a binary string.***
