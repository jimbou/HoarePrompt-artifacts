Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order. The issue lies in the way it calculates the cost. The program increments the cost whenever it encounters a 0 after a 1 or a 1 before a 0, but this is not the correct approach.

A counterexample is the string "101". The program will output 2, but the correct answer is 1. The optimal operation is to cyclically shift the substring "10" to get "01", which has a cost of 2, but then we can cyclically shift the whole string to get "101" which has a cost of 1.

The correct approach would be to count the number of 1's that appear before the first 0, and the number of 0's that appear after the last 1. The minimum total cost would be the sum of these two counts.
