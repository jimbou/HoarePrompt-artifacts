Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `s` is a list of integers representing a binary string that must have at least 1 integer, `c` is the first integer in the list and is not equal to 0, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of zeroes in `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where `cnt[c]` is increased by 1, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`, `stdin` contains `n-1` lines, each containing a binary string**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to `zeroes - cnt[0]`, which is the difference between the number of zeroes in the binary string `s` and the count of zeroes in the list `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged.
