Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `s` is a list of integers representing a binary string that must have at least 1 integer, `c` is the first integer in the list, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of zeroes in `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where `cnt[c]` is increased by 1, `ans` is 0, `stdin` contains `n-1` lines, each containing a binary string**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[c]` has been increased by 1, where `c` is the first integer in the list `s`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `n-1` lines, each containing a binary string.
