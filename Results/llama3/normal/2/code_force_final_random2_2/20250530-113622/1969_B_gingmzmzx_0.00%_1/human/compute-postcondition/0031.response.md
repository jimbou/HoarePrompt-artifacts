Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where `cnt[0]` is 1 and `cnt[1]` is 0, `stdin` contains `n-3` lines, each containing a binary string, `c` is the first element of the list `s`. If `c` is 0, then `ans` is 0. If `c` is not 0, then `ans` is `zeroes - 1`.***
