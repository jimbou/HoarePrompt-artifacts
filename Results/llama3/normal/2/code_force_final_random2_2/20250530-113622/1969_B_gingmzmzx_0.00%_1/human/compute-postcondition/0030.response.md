Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where `cnt[0]` is 1 and `cnt[1]` is 0, `ans` is `zeroes - 1`, `stdin` contains `n-3` lines, each containing a binary string, `c` is the first element of the list `s` and `c` is not equal to 0**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to `zeroes - 1`, which is the result of subtracting `cnt[0]` (which is 1) from `zeroes`. The other variables remain unchanged.
