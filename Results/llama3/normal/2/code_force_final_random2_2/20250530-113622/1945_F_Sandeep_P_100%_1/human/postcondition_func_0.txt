This function returns a decorator that modifies the behavior of a repr function to return a specified fill value when encountering a recursive call. The fill value is a string that is passed as an argument. The purpose of this function is to provide a way to customize the representation of recursive data structures, allowing users to specify a custom value to be returned when a recursive call is encountered.
