#State of the program right berfore the function call: fillvalue is a string
    """Decorator to make a repr function return fillvalue for a recursive call."""
    return decorating_function
    #The program returns the decorating_function which is a decorator that makes a repr function return fillvalue for a recursive call, where fillvalue is a string.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function returns a decorator that modifies the behavior of a repr function to return a specified fill value when encountering a recursive call. The fill value is a string that is passed as an argument. The purpose of this function is to provide a way to customize the representation of recursive data structures, allowing users to specify a custom value to be returned when a recursive call is encountered.
