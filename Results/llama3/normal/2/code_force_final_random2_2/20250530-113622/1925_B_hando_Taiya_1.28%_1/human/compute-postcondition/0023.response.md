Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= x <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= n <= x), `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `ans` will hold the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`. This is because the loop iterates over all possible divisors of `x` (from 1 to the square root of `x`) and updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the divisor if the divisor is less than or equal to `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to the divisor, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the divisor. If `n` is greater than the divisor, `ans` remains unchanged.
