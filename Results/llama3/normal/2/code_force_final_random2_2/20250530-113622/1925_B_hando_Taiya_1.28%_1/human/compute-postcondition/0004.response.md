The code `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. Since `ans` is initially 0 and `i` is 1, the value of `ans` will be updated to 1.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code. The stdin still contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` and `n`. The value of `x` is still an integer between 1 and 10^8, and `n` is still an integer between 1 and `x`. The current value of `x` is still divisible by `i`, and the current value of `n` is still less than or equal to the integer division of `x` by `i`.

Output State: **`ans` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` and `n`, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `x` is divisible by `i`, `n` is less than or equal to the integer division of `x` by `i`, and `i` is 1.**
