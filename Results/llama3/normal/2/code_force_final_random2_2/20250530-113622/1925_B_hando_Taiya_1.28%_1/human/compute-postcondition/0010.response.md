Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= x <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= n <= x), `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is either 1 or the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // i`, `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, then `ans` is 1. If `n` is larger than `x // i`, then `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // i`. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // i`.***
