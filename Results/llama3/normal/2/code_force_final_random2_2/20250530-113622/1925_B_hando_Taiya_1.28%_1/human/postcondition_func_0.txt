This function reads input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, followed by t lines, each containing two integers x and n. It then calculates and prints the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to n for each pair of x and n. The function iterates through all pairs of x and n, and for each pair, it finds the maximum divisor of x that does not exceed n. The result is printed to the console.
