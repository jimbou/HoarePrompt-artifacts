Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= x <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= n <= x), `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and 2, `i` is 2, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, then `ans` is 1. If `n` is larger than `x // i`, then `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // i`. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // i`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and 2, since `i` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `n` and `x` are still valid.
