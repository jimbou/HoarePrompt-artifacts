The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= x <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= n <= x), `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `x` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 1.
State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= x <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= n <= x), `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is 0, `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**
