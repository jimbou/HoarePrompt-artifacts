Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= x <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= n <= x), `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is either 1 or the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // 3`, `i` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x // 3`, where `x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 (inclusive) and `i` is 3. The values of `stdin`, `x`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
