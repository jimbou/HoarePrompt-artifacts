The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is greater than 0, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `x` must be greater than or equal to 4 (since 2 is less than or equal to the square root of 4).
State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= x <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= n <= x), `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is either 1 or the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // i`, `i` is 2, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, then `ans` is 1. If `n` is larger than `x // i`, then `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // i`. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // i`.**
