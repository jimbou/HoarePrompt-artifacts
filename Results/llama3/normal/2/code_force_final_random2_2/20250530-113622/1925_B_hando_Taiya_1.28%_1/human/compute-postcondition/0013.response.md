Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= x <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= n <= x), `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // 2`, `i` is 2, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `n` is less than or equal to `x // 2`, then `ans` is 1. If `n` is larger than `x // 2`, then `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // 2`. If `n` is less than or equal to `2`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // 2`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x` divided by 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `x` is still between 4 and 10^8, and `n` is still between 1 and `x`. The value of `i` is still 2, and `x` is still divisible by `i`. The conditions for `ans` being 1 or the maximum of its previous value and `x // 2` still apply, depending on the values of `n` and `x`.
