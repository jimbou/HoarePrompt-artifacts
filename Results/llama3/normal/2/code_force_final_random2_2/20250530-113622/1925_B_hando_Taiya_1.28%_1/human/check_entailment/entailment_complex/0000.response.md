Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the correct number of test cases (`t`) and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the correct input values (`x` and `n`) and initializes the answer variable (`ans`) to 0.
3. The program then iterates through all possible divisors of `x` (from 1 to the square root of `x`) and checks if the current divisor is less than or equal to `n`. If it is, it updates the answer variable (`ans`) with the maximum of the current divisor and the previous answer.
4. If the current divisor is not less than or equal to `n`, but `n` is less than or equal to the current divisor, it updates the answer variable (`ans`) with the maximum of the quotient of `x` divided by the current divisor and the previous answer.
5. After iterating through all possible divisors, the program prints the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` for each pair of `x` and `n`.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties of the sub-problems optimally.

Correctness: **True**
