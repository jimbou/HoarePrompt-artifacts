Output State: **stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x), x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, ans is 0**

The first line reads an integer t from stdin, which is between 1 and 10^3. It then reads the first line from stdin, which contains two integers x and n, and assigns them to the variables x and n respectively. The second line initializes the variable ans to 0. 

Since t is between 1 and 10^3, there are t-1 lines left in stdin, each containing two integers x and n. The values of x and n are between 1 and 10^8, and n is less than or equal to x. The variable ans is initialized to 0.
