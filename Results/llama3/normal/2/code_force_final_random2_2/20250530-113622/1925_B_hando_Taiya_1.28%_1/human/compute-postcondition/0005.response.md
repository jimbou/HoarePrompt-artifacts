Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= x <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= n <= x), `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is 0, `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`, and `n` is larger than `x // i`***
