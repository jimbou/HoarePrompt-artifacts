Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= x <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= n <= x), `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // i`, `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`, and `n` is larger than `x // i`. The current value of `n` is less than or equal to `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the integer division of `x` by `i`. All other variables remain unchanged, with `stdin` still containing `t-1` lines of input, `x` and `n` within their specified ranges, and `i` still equal to 1. The divisibility and comparison relationships between `x`, `i`, and `n` are also preserved.
