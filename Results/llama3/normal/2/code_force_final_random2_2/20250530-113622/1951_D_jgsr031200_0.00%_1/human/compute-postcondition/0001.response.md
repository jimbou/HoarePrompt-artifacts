Based on the precondition, the initial state of the program is that n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and the current value of n is equal to the current value of k.

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`. This statement does not depend on the values of n or k, it will always print the string 'YES'.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the string 'YES', regardless of the values of n and k.

Output: **YES**
