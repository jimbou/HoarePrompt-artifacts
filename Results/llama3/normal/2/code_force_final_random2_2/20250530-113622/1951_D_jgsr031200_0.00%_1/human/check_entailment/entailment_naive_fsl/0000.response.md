Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when n is greater than k and n - k + 1 is greater than 1. In this case, the program will print 'YES' and print the costs [n - k + 1, 1], but this is not a valid solution because the total number of jewels bought is not equal to k.

For example, if n = 10 and k = 3, the program will print 'YES' and print the costs [8, 1], but the total number of jewels bought is 8 + 1 = 9, which is not equal to 3.

The program should check if n - k + 1 is greater than 1 and handle this case separately.
