Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer less than n, costs is a list containing two elements: n - k + 1 and 1, h is 0**

In this output state, the values of n and k remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code creates a new list called costs and assigns it two elements: n - k + 1 and 1. The value of n - k + 1 is calculated based on the initial values of n and k, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18 and n is not equal to k. The variable h is assigned a value of 0.
