According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `costs`. If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer less than n and h is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the i is the first element in the list.
State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer less than n, costs is a list containing at least 1 element, i is the first element in the list, h is 0**
