You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18.
    if (n == k) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return
        #The program returns nothing, 'YES' is printed, and the number 1 is printed twice. The values of n and k remain unchanged as positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is still equal to k.
    #State: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is not equal to k
    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns nothing
    #State: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k
    costs = [n - k + 1, 1]
    h = 0
    for i in costs:
        curr = n // i
        
        h += curr
        
        n -= i * curr
        
    #State: n is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the sum of all elements in the list costs times the integer division of n by each element in the list, k is a positive integer less than n, costs is an empty list, i is the last element in the original list, h is a positive integer equal to its original value plus the sum of the integer division of n by each element in the list, curr is the integer division of n by the last element in the list.
    if (h < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(*costs)
        #This is printed: (nothing, an empty line)
    #State: *n is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the sum of all elements in the list costs times the integer division of n by each element in the list, k is a positive integer less than n, costs is an empty list, i is the last element in the original list, h is a positive integer equal to its original value plus the sum of the integer division of n by each element in the list, curr is the integer division of n by the last element in the list. If h is less than k, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed and an empty list is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing, 'YES' is printed, and the number 1 is printed twice. The values of n and k remain unchanged as positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is still equal to k.

Case_2: The program returns nothing

Case_3: n is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the sum of all elements in the list costs times the integer division of n by each element in the list, k is a positive integer less than n, costs is an empty list, i is the last element in the original list, h is a positive integer equal to its original value plus the sum of the integer division of n by each element in the list, curr is the integer division of n by the last element in the list, and the current value of h is less than the current value of k, and 'NO' is printed

Case_4: n is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the sum of all elements in the list costs times the integer division of n by each element in the list, k is a positive integer less than n, costs is an empty list, i is the last element in the original list, h is a positive integer equal to its original value plus the sum of the integer division of n by each element in the list, curr is the integer division of n by the last element in the list, and h is greater than or equal to k, and the string 'YES' is being printed, and an empty list is being printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
