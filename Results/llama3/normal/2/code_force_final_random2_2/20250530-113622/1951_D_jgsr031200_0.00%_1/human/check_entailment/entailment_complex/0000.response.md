Reasoning: 

The function `func_1(n, k)` is designed to determine whether it is possible to reduce a given positive integer `n` to a target value `k` by repeatedly subtracting either 1 or `n-k+1` from `n`. 

The function first checks if `n` is equal to `k`, in which case it prints 'YES' and the number 1 twice, indicating that no subtractions are needed. 

If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO', indicating that it is impossible to reach `k` by subtracting positive integers from `n`. 

Otherwise, it calculates the number of subtractions required to reach `k` by repeatedly subtracting `n-k+1` and 1 from `n`. If the total number of subtractions is less than `k`, it prints 'NO', indicating that it is impossible to reach `k`. 

Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and the sequence of subtractions, indicating that it is possible to reach `k`. 

However, there is a logical error in the function. The line `print(*costs)` is supposed to print the sequence of subtractions, but the list `costs` is empty at this point, so it will print nothing. 

Therefore, the function is not entirely correct.

Correctness: **False**
