Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly handles the cases where `n` is equal to `k`, `n` is less than `k`, and `n` is greater than `k`. For the case where `n` is greater than `k`, it calculates the number of subtractions required to reach `k` by repeatedly subtracting either 1 or `n-k+1` from `n`. If the total number of subtractions is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and the sequence of subtractions.

Correctness: **True**
