The code block calculates the value of `curr` as the integer division of `n` by `i`, then increments `h` by this value and finally subtracts the product of `i` and `curr` from `n`. 

Since `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is a positive integer less than `n`, we can conclude that `n` is at least 2. Also, since `i` is the first element in the list `costs`, we know that `i` is at least 1.

After executing the code, `curr` will be a positive integer, `h` will be increased by the value of `curr`, and `n` will be decreased by the product of `i` and `curr`. The value of `k` remains unchanged.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer less than n, costs is a list containing at least 1 element, i is the first element in the list, h is a positive integer, curr is a positive integer**
