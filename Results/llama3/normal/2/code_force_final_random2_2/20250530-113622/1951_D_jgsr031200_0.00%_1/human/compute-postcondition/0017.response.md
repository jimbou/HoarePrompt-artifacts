The only object in the loop head is variable `i` and list `costs`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `costs`.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `costs` has at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the `i` is the second element in the list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer less than `n`, `costs` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list, `h` is a positive integer, `curr` is a positive integer**
