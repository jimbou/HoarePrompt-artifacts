To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `costs`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the `costs` list. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the second element in the list, and `costs` contains at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `costs` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` must be the third element in the list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus i times the integer division of n by i, `k` is a positive integer less than `n`, `costs` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list, `h` is a positive integer equal to its original value plus the integer division of `n` by `i`, `curr` is the integer division of `n` by `i`**
