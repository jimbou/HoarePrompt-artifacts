Output State: **n is a positive integer equal to its original value minus i times the integer division of n by i, k is a positive integer less than n, costs is a list containing at least 2 elements, i is the second element in the list, h is a positive integer equal to its original value plus the integer division of n by i, curr is the integer division of n by i**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been reduced by the product of `i` and the integer division of `n` by `i`, which is equivalent to removing the largest multiple of `i` that is less than or equal to `n`. The value of `h` has been increased by the integer division of `n` by `i`, which is the same value that was assigned to `curr`. The value of `curr` is now the integer division of `n` by `i`, which is a positive integer. The values of `k` and `costs` remain unchanged.
