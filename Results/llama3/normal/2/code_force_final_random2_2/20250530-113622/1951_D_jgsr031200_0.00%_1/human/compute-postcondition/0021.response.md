Output State: **n is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the sum of all elements in the list costs times the integer division of n by each element in the list, k is a positive integer less than n, costs is an empty list, i is the last element in the original list, h is a positive integer equal to its original value plus the sum of the integer division of n by each element in the list, curr is the integer division of n by the last element in the list.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of n will be reduced by the sum of all elements in the list costs multiplied by the integer division of n by each element in the list. The value of k remains unchanged, as a positive integer less than n. The list costs will be empty after all elements have been processed. The variable i will hold the value of the last element in the original list. The value of h will be increased by the sum of the integer division of n by each element in the list. The variable curr will hold the integer division of n by the last element in the list.
