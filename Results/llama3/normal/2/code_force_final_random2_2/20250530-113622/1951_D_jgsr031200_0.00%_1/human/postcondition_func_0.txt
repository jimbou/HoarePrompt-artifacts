This function determines whether it is possible to reduce a given positive integer `n` to a target value `k` by repeatedly subtracting either 1 or `n-k+1` from `n`, and prints the result. If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES' and the number 1 twice. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it calculates the number of subtractions required to reach `k` and prints 'YES' if possible, along with the sequence of subtractions, or 'NO' if not possible.
