Output State: **`_` is equal to `k`, `heap` is a list containing `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus, `combined` has at least one item less than before, `item` is the second last item that was in `combined` before popping the last item, `removed_item` is the item with the smallest price in `heap` before pushing `item`, `current_profit` is updated based on the prices and bonuses of `removed_item` and `item`, `max_profit` is updated if `current_profit` is greater.**

In this output state, the value of `removed_item` is the item with the smallest price in `heap` before pushing `item`. The value of `current_profit` is updated based on the prices and bonuses of `removed_item` and `item`. If `removed_item` exists, `current_profit` is decreased by the negative price of `removed_item` and then increased by the negative price of `item` minus the bonus of `item` if the sum of the price and bonus of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise increased by the negative price of `item` minus the negative price of `removed_item`. If `removed_item` does not exist, `current_profit` is increased by the negative price of `item` minus the bonus of `item` if the sum of the price and bonus of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise increased by the negative price of `item`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`. If `removed_item` exists, `current_profit` is decreased by the negative price of `removed_item`. If the sum of the price and bonus of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, then `current_profit` is decreased by the bonus of `item`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is greater than or equal to `max_profit` minus the bonus of `item` plus the negative price of `item`.
