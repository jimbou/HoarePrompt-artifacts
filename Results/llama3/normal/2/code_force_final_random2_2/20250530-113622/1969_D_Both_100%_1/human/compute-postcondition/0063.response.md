The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `k`. If `_` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 1.
State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `k` is greater than 1, `n` is a new value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of new values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices corresponding to the new prices, `bonuses` is a list of new values returned by `func_2()`, `remaining_items` is an empty list. If `combined` is not empty, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing negative prices and corresponding bonuses with one less element, `heap` is a list containing one tuple of negative price and corresponding bonus, `current_profit` is 0, and `max_profit` is 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
