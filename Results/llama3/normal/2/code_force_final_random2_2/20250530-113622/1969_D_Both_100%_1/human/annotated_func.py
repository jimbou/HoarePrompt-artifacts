#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: an integer (greater than 0).
    return int(read_input())
    #The program returns an integer that is greater than 0

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads an integer input from stdin and returns it as an integer value greater than 0.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: read_input() returns a string containing a space-separated list of integers.
    return map(int, read_input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains a sequence of integers, where each integer is a part of the space-separated list of integers returned by the read_input() function.

#Overall this is what the function does:Converts a string of space-separated integers into a sequence of integers and returns it as a map object.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: primary_items is a list of pairs of integers and secondary_heap is a list of pairs of integers, where each pair contains two integers representing the price for Alice and the price for Bob respectively.

    #State: `primary_items` is an empty list, `secondary_heap` is a list of pairs of integers, `total` is the sum of the prices for Alice from the secondary heap plus the sum of the first and second elements of each item in the original `primary_items` list if the sum of the first and second elements of the item is greater than or equal to 0.
    return total
    #The program returns the sum of the prices for Alice from the secondary heap, which is a list of pairs of integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates the total price for Alice by summing the prices from the secondary heap and adding the combined prices of items from the primary list that have a non-negative total price, then returns this total price.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function has access to functions func_1() and func_2() and func_3() and heapq module, and the input is provided through these functions. The input provided by func_1() is a non-negative integer, and the input provided by func_2() is a pair of non-negative integers and a list of non-negative integers respectively. The input provided by func_3() is a list of pairs of integers and a list of pairs of integers.

    #State: The loop counter `_` is equal to `test_cases`, the heap is empty, the combined list is empty, the item variable holds the last item that was in the combined list, the removed_item variable holds the item that was removed from the heap and is equal to the smallest item in the heap after the push operation, and the current_profit has been decreased by the first element of the removed_item if the removed_item is not empty. If the current_profit was higher than the max_profit, the max_profit is updated to be equal to the current_profit. Otherwise, the max_profit remains unchanged, and max_profit is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function iterates over a specified number of test cases, where each test case involves processing a list of prices and bonuses. It calculates the maximum possible profit by selecting a subset of the prices and bonuses, subject to certain constraints. The function prints the maximum profit for each test case.
