Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `combined` is not empty but has one less item than before, `removed_item` is not empty and is the item with the smallest value in `heap` or `item` if `item` has a smaller value than the smallest item in `heap`, `heap` now contains `item` if `item` has a smaller value than the smallest item in `heap`, otherwise it remains unchanged, and `current_profit` is decreased by the value of the first element of `removed_item`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `test_cases`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `remaining_items`, `combined`, `removed_item`, and `heap` remain the same as before. However, the value of `current_profit` is reduced by the value of the first element of `removed_item`, which is the item with the smallest value in `heap` or `item` if `item` has a smaller value than the smallest item in `heap`.
