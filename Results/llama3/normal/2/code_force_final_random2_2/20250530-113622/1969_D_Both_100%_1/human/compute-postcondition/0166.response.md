Postcondition: **The loop counter `_` is equal to the number of iterations `k`, the heap contains all items that were initially in the combined list except the first three items and the item that was removed from the heap and is equal to the smallest item in the heap after the push operation, the item variable holds the third item that was in the combined list, the combined list contains at least one item, the removed_item variable holds the item that was removed from the heap and is equal to the smallest item in the heap after the push operation. If the removed_item exists, the current_profit is decreased by the first element of the removed_item. The max_profit is updated to be equal to the current_profit if the current_profit is higher than the max_profit after the change, otherwise the max_profit remains unchanged.**
