Output State: **`_` is equal to `k`, `combined` is a non-empty list, `heap` is a list containing `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus, `current_profit` is the result of `func_3(combined, heap)`**.

In this output state, the value of `current_profit` is the result of calling the function `func_3` with the current values of `combined` and `heap` as arguments. The values of `_`, `combined`, and `heap` remain unchanged.
