Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`_` is equal to `k`, `heap` is a list containing `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`, and `current_profit` is either unchanged or is the result of `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is a non-empty list. Otherwise, no changes are made to `max_profit` and `current_profit`.
Code of the loop:
while combined:
    item = combined.pop()
    if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
        current_profit -= item[1]
    else:
        current_profit += item[0]
    removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
    if removed_item:
        current_profit -= removed_item[0]
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is equal to `k`, `heap` is a list containing `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus, `item` is a tuple of negative price and corresponding bonus, `combined` has one less item, `func_3(combined, heap)` is called. If `removed_item` exists, `current_profit` is decreased by the negative price of `removed_item`. If the sum of the price and bonus of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, then `current_profit` is greater than or equal to `max_profit` minus the bonus of `item`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit` and is increased by the negative price of `item` minus the negative price of `removed_item` if `removed_item` exists. If `removed_item` does not exist, `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit` and is increased by the negative price of `item`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`_` is equal to `k`, `heap` is a list containing `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus, `combined` has at least one item less than before, `item` is the last item that was in `combined`, `func_3(combined, heap)` is called. If the sum of the price and bonus of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, then `current_profit` is greater than or equal to `max_profit` minus the bonus of `item`. If `removed_item` exists, `current_profit` is decreased by the negative price of `removed_item` and then increased by the negative price of `item` minus the bonus of `item` if the sum of the price and bonus of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise increased by the negative price of `item` minus the negative price of `removed_item`. If `removed_item` does not exist, `current_profit` is increased by the negative price of `item` minus the bonus of `item` if the sum of the price and bonus of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise increased by the negative price of `item`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`. If `removed_item` exists, `current_profit` is decreased by the negative price of `removed_item`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`_` is equal to `k`, `heap` is a list containing `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus, `combined` has at least one item less than before, `item` is the second last item that was in `combined` before popping the last item. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`. If `removed_item` exists, `current_profit` is updated by subtracting the price of `removed_item` from its previous value. Otherwise, no changes are made to `max_profit` and `current_profit` remains the same.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
