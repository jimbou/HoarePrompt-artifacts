Output State: **`_` is equal to `k`, `heap` is a list containing `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus, `item` is a tuple of negative price and corresponding bonus, `combined` has one less item, `removed_item` is the tuple with the smallest negative price in `heap` before pushing `item`, `func_3(combined, heap)` is called, and `current_profit` is decreased by the negative price of `removed_item`. If the sum of the price and bonus of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, then the current value of `current_profit` is greater than or equal to `max_profit` minus the bonus of `item`. Otherwise, the current value of `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit` and is increased by the negative price of `item` minus the negative price of `removed_item`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `current_profit` has been updated by subtracting the negative price of `removed_item` from its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `current_profit` and `max_profit` still holds, but the value of `current_profit` has been adjusted based on the negative price of `removed_item`.
