Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `k` is greater than 1, `n` is a new value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of new values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices corresponding to the new prices, `bonuses` is a list of new values returned by `func_2()`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing negative prices and corresponding bonuses with two less elements, `heap` is a list containing two tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus, `current_profit` is 0, and `max_profit` is 0.**

In this output state, the code has removed one tuple from the `combined` list and added it to the `heap` list. The `combined` list now has one less element, and the `heap` list has one more element. The other variables remain unchanged.
