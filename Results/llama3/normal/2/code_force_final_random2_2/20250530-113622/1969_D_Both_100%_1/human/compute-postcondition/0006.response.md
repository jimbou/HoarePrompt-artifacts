Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0. If `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains the smallest tuple from the original `combined` list and `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing negative prices and corresponding bonuses, but with one less element than before. Otherwise, `heap` and `combined` remain unchanged and `remaining_items` is an empty list.***
