Postcondition: **The loop counter `_` is equal to the number of iterations `k`, the heap contains all items that were initially in the combined list, and the item variable holds the first item that was in the combined list. If the combined list is not empty, the combined list remains not empty and the current value of `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit` and is assigned the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`. Otherwise, the combined list is empty. All other variables remain unchanged.**
