Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is 1, test_cases is greater than 1, heap is an empty list, remaining_items is an empty list, n is a value returned by func_2, k is a value returned by func_2, prices is a list of values returned by func_2, neg_prices is a list of negative values of prices, bonuses is a list of values returned by func_2, max_profit is 0, current_profit is 0, combined is a sorted list of tuples containing neg_prices and bonuses, item is the last item that was in combined which is now empty.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(k):
    if combined:
        heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `test_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is a value returned by func_2, `prices` is a list of values returned by func_2, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by func_2, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0. If `combined` is not empty, `heap` is a list containing the last item that was in `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing neg_prices and bonuses and has one less item than before, `item` is the second last item that was in combined. If `combined` is empty, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`_` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `test_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is a value returned by func_2, `prices` is a list of values returned by func_2, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by func_2, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0. If `combined` is not empty, `heap` is a list containing the last item that was in `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing neg_prices and bonuses and has two less items than before, `item` is the last item that was in combined. If `combined` is empty, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The state of the variables remains unchanged if `combined` is empty. If `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains the last two items that were in `combined`, `remaining_items` is empty, and `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` with one less item than before, and `item` is the second last item that was in `combined`. The values of `_`, `k`, `test_cases`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, and `current_profit` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
