Output State: **`_` is equal to `k`, `heap` is a list containing `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus, `combined` has at least one item less than before, `item` is the last item that was in `combined`, `func_3(combined, heap)` is called, If `removed_item` exists, `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit` and is increased by the negative price of `item` minus the negative price of `removed_item` minus the bonus of `item`. If `removed_item` does not exist, `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit` and is increased by the negative price of `item` minus the bonus of `item`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`.**

In this output state, the value of `current_profit` has been updated by subtracting the bonus of `item` from it. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `removed_item` and the comparison between `current_profit` and `max_profit` are still valid.
