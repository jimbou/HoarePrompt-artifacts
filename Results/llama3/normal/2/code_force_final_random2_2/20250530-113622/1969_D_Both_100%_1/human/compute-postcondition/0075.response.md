Postcondition: ***`_` is equal to `k`, `heap` is a list containing `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`, and `current_profit` is either unchanged or is the result of `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is a non-empty list. Otherwise, no changes are made to `max_profit` and `current_profit`.***
