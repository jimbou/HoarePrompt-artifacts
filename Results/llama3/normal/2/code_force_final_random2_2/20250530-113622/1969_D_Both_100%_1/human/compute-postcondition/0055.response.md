The `print(max_profit)` statement will print the maximum profit that can be obtained by removing items from `combined` and adding them to `heap`.

Since the exact values of `combined` and `heap` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `max_profit`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the maximum profit that can be obtained by removing items from `combined` and adding them to `heap`.

Output: **max_profit (where max_profit is the maximum profit that can be obtained by removing items from `combined` and adding them to `heap`)**
