Output State: **`_` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `test_cases` is greater than 1, `heap` is a list containing the last item that was in `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is a value returned by func_2, `prices` is a list of values returned by func_2, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by func_2, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing neg_prices and bonuses and has one less item than before, `item` is the second last item that was in combined.**

In this output state, the code has pushed the last item from the `combined` list into the `heap` using `heapq.heappush`. The `combined` list now has one less item than before, and the `item` variable now points to the second last item that was in `combined`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
