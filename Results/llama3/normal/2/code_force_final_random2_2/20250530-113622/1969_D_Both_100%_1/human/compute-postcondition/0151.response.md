Postcondition: **The loop counter `_` is equal to the number of iterations `k`, the heap contains all items that were initially in the combined list except the first two items and the item that was removed from the heap, the item variable holds the second item that was in the combined list, the combined list contains at least one item less than before, the removed_item variable holds the item that was removed from the heap. If the sum of the first and second elements of the item is greater than or equal to 0, the current_profit has been decreased by the second element of the item variable. Otherwise, the current_profit has been increased by the first element of the item. In both cases, if the current_profit was higher than the max_profit before the change, the max_profit is updated to be equal to the current_profit. Otherwise, the max_profit remains unchanged.**
