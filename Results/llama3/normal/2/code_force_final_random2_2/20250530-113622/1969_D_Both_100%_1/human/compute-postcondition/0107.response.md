Postcondition: ***`_` is equal to `k`, `heap` is a list containing `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus, `combined` has at least one item less than before, `item` is the second last item that was in `combined` before popping the last item. If `removed_item` exists, `current_profit` is updated by subtracting the price of `removed_item` from its previous value, and `max_profit` is updated if the new `current_profit` is greater. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
