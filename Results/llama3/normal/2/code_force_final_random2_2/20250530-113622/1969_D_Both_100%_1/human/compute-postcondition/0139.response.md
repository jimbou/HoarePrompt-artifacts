Postcondition: ***The loop counter `_` is equal to the number of iterations `k`, the heap contains all items that were initially in the combined list except the first item, the item variable holds the first item that was in the combined list, and the combined list contains all items except the first item. If the sum of the first two elements of the first item is greater than or equal to 0, then the `current_profit` has been decreased by the second element of the first item. If the sum of the first two elements of the first item is less than 0, then the `current_profit` has been increased by the first element of the first item.***
