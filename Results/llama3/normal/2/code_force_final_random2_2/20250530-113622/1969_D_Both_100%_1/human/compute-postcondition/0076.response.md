The only variable in the loop head is `combined`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `combined` being non-empty. Right before the loop, `combined` is a non-empty list if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit` and `func_3(combined, heap)` is called. So for the loop to execute the first time, `current_profit` must be greater than `max_profit` and `func_3(combined, heap)` must be called.

State: **`_` is equal to `k`, `heap` is a list containing `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus, `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, and `func_3(combined, heap)` is called**
