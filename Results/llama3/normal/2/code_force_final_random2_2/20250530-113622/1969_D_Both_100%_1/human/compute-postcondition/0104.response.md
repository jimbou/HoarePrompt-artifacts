Postcondition: ***`_` is equal to `k`, `heap` is a list containing `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus, `combined` has at least one item less than before, `item` is the second last item that was in `combined` before popping the last item, `func_3(combined, heap)` is called. If the sum of the price and bonus of the last item that was in `combined` is greater than or equal to 0, then `current_profit` is greater than or equal to `max_profit` minus the bonus of the last item that was in `combined`. If `removed_item` exists, `current_profit` is decreased by the negative price of `removed_item` and then increased by the negative price of the last item that was in `combined` minus the bonus of the last item that was in `combined` if the sum of the price and bonus of the last item that was in `combined` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise increased by the negative price of the last item that was in `combined` minus the negative price of `removed_item`. If `removed_item` does not exist, `current_profit` is increased by the negative price of the last item that was in `combined` minus the bonus of the last item that was in `combined` if the sum of the price and bonus of the last item that was in `combined` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise increased by the negative price of the last item that was in `combined`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`. If `removed_item` exists, `current_profit` is decreased by the negative price of `removed_item`. If the sum of the price and bonus of the second last item that was in `combined` before popping the last item is greater than or equal to 0, then `current_profit` is decreased by the bonus of the second last item that was in `combined` before popping the last item. Otherwise, `current_profit` is greater than or equal to `max_profit` minus the bonus of the last item that was in `combined` plus the negative price of the second last item that was in `combined`.***
