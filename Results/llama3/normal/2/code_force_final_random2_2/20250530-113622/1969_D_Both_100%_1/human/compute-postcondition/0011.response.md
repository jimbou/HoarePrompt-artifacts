Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `k` must be greater than 2, `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `heap` contains the smallest tuple from the original `combined` list, and `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing negative prices and corresponding bonuses, but with one less element than before.**

In this output state, the values of `test_cases`, `_`, `k`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, and `current_profit` remain unchanged. The `heap` now contains the smallest tuple from the original `combined` list, and the `combined` list has one less element than before. The `remaining_items` list is still empty.
