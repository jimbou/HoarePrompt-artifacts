According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable combined. If combined is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, combined contains at least one item less than before. So for the loop to be executed one more time combined must contain at least one item.
State: **The loop counter `_` is equal to the number of iterations `k`, the heap contains all items that were initially in the combined list except the first two items, the item variable holds the second item that was in the combined list, the combined list contains at least one item, the removed_item variable holds the item that was removed from the heap and is equal to the smallest item in the heap after the push operation, and the current_profit has been decreased by the first element of the removed_item variable. The max_profit is updated to be equal to the current_profit if the current_profit was higher than the max_profit before the change, otherwise the max_profit remains unchanged.**
