To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(test_cases):`.

The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `test_cases`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is equal to `k`, and `test_cases` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `test_cases` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k + 1`, `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `combined` is empty, `heap` contains the smallest tuple from the original `combined` list, `current_profit` is the maximum profit that can be obtained by removing items from `combined` and adding them to `heap`, and `max_profit` is the maximum profit that can be obtained by removing items from `combined` and adding them to `heap`, and the maximum profit that can be obtained by removing items from `combined` and adding them to `heap` is printed**
