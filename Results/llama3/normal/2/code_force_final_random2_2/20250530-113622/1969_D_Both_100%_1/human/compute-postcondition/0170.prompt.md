Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function has access to functions func_1() and func_2() and func_3() and heapq module, test_cases is a non-negative integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(test_cases):
    heap = []
    remaining_items = []
    n, k = func_2()
    prices = list(func_2())
    neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]
    bonuses = list(func_2())
    max_profit = 0
    current_profit = 0
    combined = list(zip(neg_prices, bonuses))
    combined.sort(key=lambda item: item[1])
    for _ in range(k):
        if combined:
            heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())
    if combined:
        current_profit = func_3(combined, heap)
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit
    while combined:
        item = combined.pop()
        if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
            current_profit -= item[1]
        else:
            current_profit += item[0]
        removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
        if removed_item:
            current_profit -= removed_item[0]
        if current_profit > max_profit:
            max_profit = current_profit
    print(max_profit)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `combined` is empty, `heap` contains the smallest tuple from the original `combined` list, `current_profit` is the maximum profit that can be obtained by removing items from `combined` and adding them to `heap`, and `max_profit` is the maximum profit that can be obtained by removing items from `combined` and adding them to `heap`, and the maximum profit that can be obtained by removing items from `combined` and adding them to `heap` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is equal to `k`, `heap` is a list containing `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus, `combined` is an empty list, `item` is the last item that was in `combined`, `func_3(combined, heap)` is called. If the sum of the price and bonus of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, then `current_profit` is greater than or equal to `max_profit` minus the bonus of `item`. If `removed_item` exists, `current_profit` is decreased by the negative price of `removed_item` and then increased by the negative price of `item` minus the bonus of `item` if the sum of the price and bonus of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise increased by the negative price of `item` minus the negative price of `removed_item`. If `removed_item` does not exist, `current_profit` is increased by the negative price of `item` minus the bonus of `item` if the sum of the price and bonus of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise increased by the negative price of `item`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`. If `removed_item` exists, `current_profit` is decreased by the negative price of `removed_item`, and the maximum profit is printed, which is `max_profit`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop counter `_` is equal to the number of iterations `k`, the heap contains all items that were initially in the combined list except the first `k` items and the items that were removed from the heap, the item variable holds the last item that was in the combined list, the combined list is empty, the removed_item variable holds the item that was removed from the heap and is equal to the smallest item in the heap after the push operation, and the current_profit has been decreased by the first element of the removed_item if the removed_item is not empty. If the current_profit was higher than the max_profit, the max_profit is updated to be equal to the current_profit. Otherwise, the max_profit remains unchanged, and max_profit is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
