Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `combined` is not empty and has at least one item less than before, `item` is the last item that was in `combined`, `removed_item` is either empty or the item with the smallest value in `heap` or `item` if `item` has a smaller value than the smallest item in `heap`, `heap` now contains `item` if `item` has a smaller value than the smallest item in `heap`, otherwise it remains unchanged. If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, then `current_profit` is decreased by the value of the second element of `item`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by the value of the first element of `item`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `removed_item` has been updated to be either the item with the smallest value in `heap` or `item` if `item` has a smaller value than the smallest item in `heap`. The `heap` has also been updated to contain `item` if `item` has a smaller value than the smallest item in `heap`, otherwise it remains unchanged. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
