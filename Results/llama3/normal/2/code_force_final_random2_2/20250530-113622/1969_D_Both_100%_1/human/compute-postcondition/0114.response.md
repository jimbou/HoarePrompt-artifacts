Output State: **_ is 1, test_cases is greater than 1, heap is an empty list, remaining_items is an empty list, n is a value returned by func_2, k is a value returned by func_2, prices is a list of values returned by func_2, neg_prices is a list of negative values of prices, bonuses is a list of values returned by func_2, max_profit is 0, current_profit is 0, combined is a sorted list of tuples containing neg_prices and bonuses, item is the last item that was in combined which is now empty.**

In this output state, the initial values of `_`, `test_cases`, and `item` are preserved. The `heap` and `remaining_items` lists are reset to empty lists. The values of `n`, `k`, `prices`, and `bonuses` are updated to the values returned by the `func_2` function. The `neg_prices` list is created by negating the values in the `prices` list. The `combined` list is created by zipping the `neg_prices` and `bonuses` lists and sorting them based on the bonuses. The `max_profit` and `current_profit` variables are initialized to 0.
