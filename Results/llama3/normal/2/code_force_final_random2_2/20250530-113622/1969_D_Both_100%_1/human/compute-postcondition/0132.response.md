Postcondition: ***The loop counter `_` is equal to the number of iterations `k`, the heap contains all items that were initially in the combined list, and the item variable holds the first item that was in the combined list. If the combined list is not empty, the combined list remains not empty and `current_profit` is assigned the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged. All other variables remain unchanged.***
