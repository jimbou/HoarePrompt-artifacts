Output State: **`_` is equal to `k`, `combined` is an empty list, `heap` is a list containing `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `_` will be equal to `k`, indicating that the loop has completed `k` iterations. The list `combined` will be empty, as all its elements will have been pushed onto the heap. The heap will contain `k` tuples, each consisting of a negative price and its corresponding bonus, which were popped from the `combined` list during each iteration of the loop.
