Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function has access to functions func_1() and func_2() and func_3() and heapq module, test_cases is greater than 0, _ is 0, heap is an empty list, remaining_items is an empty list, n and k are values returned by func_2(), prices is a list of values returned by func_2(), neg_prices is a list of negative prices, bonuses is a list of values returned by func_2(), max_profit is 0, current_profit is 0, combined is a sorted list of tuples containing negative prices and corresponding bonuses.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(k):
    if combined:
        heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0. If `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains the smallest tuple from the original `combined` list and `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing negative prices and corresponding bonuses, but with one less element than before. Otherwise, `heap` and `combined` remain unchanged and `remaining_items` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `k` must be greater than 1, `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0. If `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains the smallest tuple from the original `combined` list and `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing negative prices and corresponding bonuses, but with one less element than before. Otherwise, `heap` and `combined` remain unchanged and `remaining_items` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `k` must be greater than 2, `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list. If `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains the smallest tuple from the original `combined` list and `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing negative prices and corresponding bonuses, but with one less element than before. Otherwise, `heap` and `combined` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
