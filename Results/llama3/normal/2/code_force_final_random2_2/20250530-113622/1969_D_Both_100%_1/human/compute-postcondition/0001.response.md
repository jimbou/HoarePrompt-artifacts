The only variables in the loop head are variables  _ and test_cases, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable test_cases. If test_cases is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the function has access to functions func_1(), func_2(), and func_3(), and the heapq module, but these do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted. test_cases is a non-negative integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to test_cases is greater than 0 and _ is now 0.
State: **The function has access to functions func_1() and func_2() and func_3() and heapq module, test_cases is greater than 0, _ is 0**
