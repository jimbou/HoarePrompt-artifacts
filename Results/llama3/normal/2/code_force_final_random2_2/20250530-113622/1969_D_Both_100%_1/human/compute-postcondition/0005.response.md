The code `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` pushes the smallest tuple from the sorted list `combined` into the heap. Since `combined` is not empty, this operation will remove the smallest tuple from `combined` and add it to the heap.

Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` contains the smallest tuple from the original `combined` list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, and `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing negative prices and corresponding bonuses, but with one less element than before.**
