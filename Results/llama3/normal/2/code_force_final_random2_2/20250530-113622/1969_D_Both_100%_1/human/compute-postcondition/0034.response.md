The only variable in the loop head is variable combined, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable combined.  If combined is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, combined is not empty but has one less item than before, So for the loop to be executed one more time combined must have at least one item.
State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `combined` is not empty and has at least one item, and if `removed_item` is not empty, it is the item with the smallest value in `heap` or `item` if `item` has a smaller value than the smallest item in `heap`, `heap` now contains `item` if `item` has a smaller value than the smallest item in `heap`, otherwise it remains unchanged, and `current_profit` is decreased by the value of the first element of `removed_item`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
