Postcondition: ***The loop counter `_` is equal to the number of iterations `k`, the heap contains all items that were initially in the combined list except the first two items, the item variable holds the second item that was in the combined list, the combined list contains at least one item less than before. If the removed_item variable is not empty, the removed_item variable holds the item that was removed from the heap and is equal to the smallest item in the heap after the push operation, and the current_profit has been decreased by the first element of the removed_item variable. If the current_profit was higher than the max_profit before the change, the max_profit is updated to be equal to the current_profit. Otherwise, the max_profit remains unchanged. If the removed_item variable is empty, the state of the variables remains the same as before the if statement, with the current_profit and max_profit unchanged.***
