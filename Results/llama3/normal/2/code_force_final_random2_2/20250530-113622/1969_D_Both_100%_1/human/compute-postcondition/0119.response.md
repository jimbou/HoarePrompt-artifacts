The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `k`. If `_` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 1.
State: **`_` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `test_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is a value returned by func_2, `prices` is a list of values returned by func_2, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by func_2, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0. If `combined` is not empty, `heap` is a list containing the last item that was in `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing neg_prices and bonuses and has one less item than before, `item` is the second last item that was in combined. If `combined` is empty, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
