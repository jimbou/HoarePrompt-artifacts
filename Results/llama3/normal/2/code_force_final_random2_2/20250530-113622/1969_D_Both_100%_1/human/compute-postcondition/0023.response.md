Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `combined` is not empty but has one less item than before, `item` is the last item that was in `combined`, the sum of the first two elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, and `current_profit` is decreased by the second element of `item`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is still greater than 0, and the variables `_`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` retain their previous values. The list `combined` has one less item than before, and the variable `item` holds the last item that was in `combined`. The sum of the first two elements of `item` is still greater than or equal to 0. The variable `remaining_items` is still an empty list. The variable `current_profit` has been decreased by the second element of `item`.
