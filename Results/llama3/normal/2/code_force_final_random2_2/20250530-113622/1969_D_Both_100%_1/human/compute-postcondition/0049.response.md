Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `combined` is not empty and has at least one item less than before, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` and has been removed from `combined`, `removed_item` is the item with the smallest value in `heap` or `item` if `item` has a smaller value than the smallest item in `heap`, `heap` now contains `item` if `item` has a smaller value than the smallest item in `heap`, otherwise it remains unchanged. If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, then `current_profit` is decreased by the value of the second element of `item`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by the value of the first element of `item`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `removed_item` is not empty, then `current_profit` is decreased by the value of the first element of `removed_item`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The number of test cases is still greater than 0. The variable `_` is still equal to `k`. The values of `n` and `k` are still the values returned by `func_2()`. The lists `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged. The list `remaining_items` is still empty. The list `combined` has at least one item less than before, and the last item that was in `combined` has been removed and is now stored in the variable `item`. The variable `removed_item` now holds the item with the smallest value in the heap, or the item if it has a smaller value than the smallest item in the heap. The heap now contains the item if it has a smaller value than the smallest item in the heap, otherwise it remains unchanged. The current profit has been updated based on the values of `item` and `removed_item`. If the current profit is greater than the maximum profit, the maximum profit has been updated to be equal to the current profit.
