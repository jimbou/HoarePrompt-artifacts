Output State: **The loop counter `_` is equal to the number of iterations `k`, the heap contains all items that were initially in the combined list except the first three items, the item variable holds the third item that was in the combined list, the combined list contains at least one item, the removed_item variable holds the item that was removed from the heap and is equal to the smallest item in the heap after the push operation, and the current_profit has been decreased by the first element of the removed_item variable. The max_profit is updated to be equal to the current_profit if the current_profit was higher than the max_profit before the change, otherwise the max_profit remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The loop counter is still equal to the number of iterations, the heap has lost one more item which is now stored in the item variable, the combined list has also lost one item, and the other variables remain unchanged.
