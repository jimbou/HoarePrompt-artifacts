Output State: **`_` is equal to `k`, `heap` is a list containing `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus, `combined` is an empty list, `item` is the last item that was in `combined`, `func_3(combined, heap)` is called. If the sum of the price and bonus of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, then `current_profit` is greater than or equal to `max_profit` minus the bonus of `item`. If `removed_item` exists, `current_profit` is decreased by the negative price of `removed_item` and then increased by the negative price of `item` minus the bonus of `item` if the sum of the price and bonus of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise increased by the negative price of `item` minus the negative price of `removed_item`. If `removed_item` does not exist, `current_profit` is increased by the negative price of `item` minus the bonus of `item` if the sum of the price and bonus of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise increased by the negative price of `item`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`. If `removed_item` exists, `current_profit` is decreased by the negative price of `removed_item`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `_` is equal to `k`, `heap` is a list containing `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus, `combined` is an empty list, and `item` is the last item that was in `combined`. The value of `current_profit` is updated based on the sum of the price and bonus of `item` and the existence of `removed_item`. If the sum of the price and bonus of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, then `current_profit` is greater than or equal to `max_profit` minus the bonus of `item`. If `removed_item` exists, `current_profit` is decreased by the negative price of `removed_item` and then increased by the negative price of `item` minus the bonus of `item` if the sum of the price and bonus of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise increased by the negative price of `item` minus the negative price of `removed_item`. If `removed_item` does not exist, `current_profit` is increased by the negative price of `item` minus the bonus of `item` if the sum of the price and bonus of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise increased by the negative price of `item`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`. If `removed_item` exists, `current_profit` is decreased by the negative price of `removed_item`.
