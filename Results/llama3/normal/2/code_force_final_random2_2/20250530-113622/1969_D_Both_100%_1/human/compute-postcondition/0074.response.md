Output State: **`_` is equal to `k`, `heap` is a list containing `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`, `current_profit` is either unchanged or is the result of `func_3(combined, heap)` and is greater than the previous `max_profit` if `combined` is a non-empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `max_profit` has been updated to be equal to `current_profit`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `current_profit` is either unchanged or is the result of `func_3(combined, heap)` and is greater than the previous `max_profit` if `combined` is a non-empty list.
