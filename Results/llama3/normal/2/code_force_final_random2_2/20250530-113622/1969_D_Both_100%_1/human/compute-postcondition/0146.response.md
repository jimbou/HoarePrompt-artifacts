Postcondition: ***The loop counter `_` is equal to the number of iterations `k`, the heap contains all items that were initially in the combined list except the first item and the item that was removed from the heap, the item variable holds the first item that was in the combined list, the combined list contains all items except the first item, the removed_item variable holds the item that was removed from the heap, and the current_profit has been decreased by the first element of the removed item if the removed_item is not empty. If the current_profit was higher than the max_profit, the max_profit is updated to be equal to the current_profit. Otherwise, the max_profit remains unchanged.***
