Output State: **`_` is equal to `k`, `heap` is a list containing `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus, `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `item` is a tuple of negative price and corresponding bonus, and `combined` has one less item, and `func_3(combined, heap)` is called**

In this output state, the value of `_` remains equal to `k`. The list `heap` still contains `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus. The value of `current_profit` is still greater than `max_profit`. A new variable `item` is introduced, which is a tuple of negative price and corresponding bonus, and is assigned the value of the last item in the `combined` list. The `combined` list now has one less item. The function `func_3(combined, heap)` is still being called.
