Postcondition: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `combined` is not empty but has one less item than before, and if `removed_item` is not empty, it is the item with the smallest value in `heap` or `item` if `item` has a smaller value than the smallest item in `heap`, `heap` now contains `item` if `item` has a smaller value than the smallest item in `heap`, otherwise it remains unchanged, and `current_profit` is decreased by the value of the first element of `removed_item`. If `removed_item` is empty, the state of the variables remains unchanged. The current value of `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`.**
