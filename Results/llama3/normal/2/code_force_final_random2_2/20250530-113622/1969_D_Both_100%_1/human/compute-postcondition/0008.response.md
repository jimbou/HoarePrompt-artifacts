Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `k` must be greater than 1, `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `heap` contains the smallest tuple from the original `combined` list, and `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing negative prices and corresponding bonuses, but with one less element than before, `remaining_items` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the code has removed the smallest tuple from the `combined` list and added it to the `heap`. The `combined` list now has one less element than before. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
