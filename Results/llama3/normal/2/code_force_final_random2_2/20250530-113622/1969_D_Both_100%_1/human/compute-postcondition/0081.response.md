Output State: **`_` is equal to `k`, `heap` is a list containing `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus, `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit` and is increased by the negative price of `item`, `item` is a tuple of negative price and corresponding bonus, `combined` has one less item, `func_3(combined, heap)` is called, and the sum of the price and bonus of `item` is less than 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `_` remains equal to `k`. The list `heap` still contains `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus. The value of `current_profit` is still greater than `max_profit`, but it has been increased by the negative price of `item`. The tuple `item` still contains a negative price and a corresponding bonus. The list `combined` still has one less item. The function `func_3(combined, heap)` is still called. The sum of the price and bonus of `item` is still less than 0.
