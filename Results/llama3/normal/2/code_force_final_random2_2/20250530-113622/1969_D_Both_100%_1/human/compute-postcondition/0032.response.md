Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `combined` is not empty but has one less item than before, `removed_item` is the item with the smallest value in `heap` or `item` if `item` has a smaller value than the smallest item in `heap`, `heap` now contains `item` if `item` has a smaller value than the smallest item in `heap`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `current_profit` is decreased by the value of the first element of `removed_item`, and `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` which is greater than the previous value of `max_profit`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is still greater than 0. The variables `_`, `n`, and `k` still hold the values returned by the function `func_2()`. The lists `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged. The list `remaining_items` is still empty. The list `combined` has one less item than before. The variable `removed_item` holds the item with the smallest value in the heap or the item if it has a smaller value than the smallest item in the heap. The heap now contains the item if it has a smaller value than the smallest item in the heap, otherwise it remains unchanged. The current profit is decreased by the value of the first element of `removed_item`. The maximum profit is now equal to the current profit, which is greater than its previous value.
