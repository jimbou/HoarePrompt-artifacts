The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `_` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 1.
State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `k` must be greater than 1, `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0. If `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains the smallest tuple from the original `combined` list and `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing negative prices and corresponding bonuses, but with one less element than before. Otherwise, `heap` and `combined` remain unchanged and `remaining_items` is an empty list.**
