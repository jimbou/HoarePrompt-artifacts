Postcondition: **The loop counter `_` is equal to the number of iterations `k`, the heap contains all items that were initially in the combined list except the first three items, the item variable holds the third item that was in the combined list, the combined list contains at least one item, the removed_item variable holds the item that was removed from the heap and is equal to the smallest item in the heap after the push operation. If the sum of the first two elements of the item variable is greater than or equal to 0, the current_profit has been decreased by the second element of the third item in the combined list. Otherwise, the current_profit is increased by the first element of the item variable. In both cases, the max_profit is updated to be equal to the current_profit if the current_profit was higher than the max_profit before the change, otherwise the max_profit remains unchanged.**
