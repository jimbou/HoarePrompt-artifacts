Postcondition: ***`_` is equal to `k`, `heap` is a list containing `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus, `combined` has at least one item less than before, `item` is the second last item that was in `combined` before popping the last item. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`. If `removed_item` exists, `current_profit` is updated by subtracting the price of `removed_item` from its previous value. Otherwise, no changes are made to `max_profit` and `current_profit` remains the same.***
