Output State: **`_` is equal to `k`, `heap` is a list containing `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus, `current_profit` is greater than or equal to `max_profit` minus the bonus of `item`, `item` is a tuple of negative price and corresponding bonus, and `combined` has one less item, and `func_3(combined, heap)` is called. The current value of the sum of the price and bonus of `item` is greater than or equal to 0**

In this output state, the value of `current_profit` has been updated by subtracting the bonus of `item` from it. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that the sum of the price and bonus of `item` is greater than or equal to 0 still holds true.
