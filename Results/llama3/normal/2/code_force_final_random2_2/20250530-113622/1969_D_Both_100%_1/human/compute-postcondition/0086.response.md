Postcondition: ***`_` is equal to `k`, `heap` is a list containing `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus, `item` is a tuple of negative price and corresponding bonus, `combined` has one less item, `func_3(combined, heap)` is called. If `removed_item` exists, `current_profit` is decreased by the negative price of `removed_item`. If the sum of the price and bonus of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, then `current_profit` is greater than or equal to `max_profit` minus the bonus of `item`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit` and is increased by the negative price of `item` minus the negative price of `removed_item` if `removed_item` exists. If `removed_item` does not exist, `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit` and is increased by the negative price of `item`***
