Postcondition: **`_` is equal to `k`, `heap` is a list containing `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus. If `combined` is a non-empty list, the current value of `current_profit` is the result of `func_3(combined, heap)` and is greater than `max_profit`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `current_profit`.**
