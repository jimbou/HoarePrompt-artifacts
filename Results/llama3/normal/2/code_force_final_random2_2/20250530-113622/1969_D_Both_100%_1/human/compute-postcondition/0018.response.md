Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`, `remaining_items` is an empty list. If `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains the smallest tuple from the original `combined` list, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing negative prices and corresponding bonuses, but with `k` less elements than before. Otherwise, `heap` and `combined` remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `max_profit` has been updated to be equal to `current_profit`, which is greater than the original value of `max_profit` (0). The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their original values and properties as described in the initial state.
