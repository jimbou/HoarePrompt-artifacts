To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved in it. The loop head is `for _ in range(k):`, which means we can only adjust the states of `_` and `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `k` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `k` must still be greater than the new value of `_`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `_` is 2
* `k` must be greater than 2

The other variables in the state (`test_cases`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, `combined`, `heap`, and `remaining_items`) are not affected by the loop head and remain unchanged.

State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `k` must be greater than 2, `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0. If `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains the smallest tuple from the original `combined` list and `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing negative prices and corresponding bonuses, but with one less element than before. Otherwise, `heap` and `combined` remain unchanged and `remaining_items` is an empty list.**
