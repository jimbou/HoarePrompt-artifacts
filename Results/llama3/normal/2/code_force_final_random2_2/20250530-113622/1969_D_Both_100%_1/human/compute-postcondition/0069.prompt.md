Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is greater than 0, _ is equal to k + 1, n and k are new values returned by func_2(), prices is a list of new values returned by func_2(), neg_prices is a list of negative prices corresponding to the new prices, bonuses is a list of new values returned by func_2(), remaining_items is an empty list, combined is a sorted list of tuples containing negative prices and corresponding bonuses, heap is an empty list, current_profit is 0, and max_profit is 0.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(k):
    if combined:
        heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `n` is a new value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of new values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices corresponding to the new prices, `bonuses` is a list of new values returned by `func_2()`, `remaining_items` is an empty list. If `combined` is not empty, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing negative prices and corresponding bonuses with one less element, `heap` is a list containing one tuple of negative price and corresponding bonus, `current_profit` is 0, and `max_profit` is 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `k` is greater than 1, `n` is a new value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of new values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices corresponding to the new prices, `bonuses` is a list of new values returned by `func_2()`, `remaining_items` is an empty list. If `combined` is not empty, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing negative prices and corresponding bonuses with two less elements, `heap` is a list containing two tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus, `current_profit` is 0, and `max_profit` is 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 3, `k` is greater than 3, `n` is a new value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of new values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices corresponding to the new prices, `bonuses` is a list of new values returned by `func_2()`, `remaining_items` is an empty list. If `combined` is not empty, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing negative prices and corresponding bonuses with three less elements, `heap` is a list containing three tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus, `current_profit` is 0, and `max_profit` is 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
