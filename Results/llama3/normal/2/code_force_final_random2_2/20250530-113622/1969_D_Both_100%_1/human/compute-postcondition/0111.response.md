The code prints the maximum profit that can be achieved by selecting items from the heap and adding them to the combined list, considering the prices and bonuses of the items.

The maximum profit is calculated based on the following conditions:

* If the sum of the price and bonus of an item is greater than or equal to 0, the current profit is increased by the negative price of the item minus the bonus of the item.
* If the sum of the price and bonus of an item is less than 0, the current profit is increased by the negative price of the item.
* If a removed item exists, the current profit is decreased by the negative price of the removed item.
* If the current profit is greater than the maximum profit, the maximum profit is updated to be equal to the current profit.

The maximum profit is calculated iteratively by calling the function `func_3(combined, heap)`.

Output: **the maximum profit that can be achieved by selecting items from the heap and adding them to the combined list, considering the prices and bonuses of the items**
