Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list. If `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains the smallest tuple from the original `combined` list and `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing negative prices and corresponding bonuses, but with `k` less elements than before. Otherwise, `heap` and `combined` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop counter `_` has reached the value of `k`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The state of the other variables remains unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body. If the `combined` list is not empty, the `heap` will contain the smallest tuple from the original `combined` list, and the `combined` list will have `k` less elements than before. If the `combined` list is empty, the `heap` and `combined` list will remain unchanged.
