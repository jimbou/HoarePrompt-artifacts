Output State: **`_` is equal to `k`, `heap` is a list containing `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus, `combined` has at least one item less than before, `item` is the second last item that was in `combined` before popping the last item, `removed_item` is the item with the smallest price in `heap` before pushing `item`, `current_profit` is updated by subtracting the price of `removed_item` from its previous value, `max_profit` is updated if the new `current_profit` is greater.**

In this output state, the value of `current_profit` has been updated by subtracting the price of `removed_item` from its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The `current_profit` is now equal to its previous value minus the price of `removed_item`, which is a tuple containing a negative price and a bonus. The `max_profit` is updated if the new `current_profit` is greater than its previous value.
