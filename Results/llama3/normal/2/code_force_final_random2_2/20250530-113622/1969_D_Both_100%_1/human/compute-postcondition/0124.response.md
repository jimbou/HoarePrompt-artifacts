Postcondition: **The state of the variables remains unchanged if `combined` is empty. If `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains the last two items that were in `combined`, `remaining_items` is empty, and `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` with one less item than before, and `item` is the second last item that was in `combined`. The values of `_`, `k`, `test_cases`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, and `current_profit` remain unchanged.**
