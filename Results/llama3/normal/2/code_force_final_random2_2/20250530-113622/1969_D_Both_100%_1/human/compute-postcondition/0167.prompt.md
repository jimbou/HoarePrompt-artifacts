Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *The loop counter `_` is equal to the number of iterations `k`, the heap contains all items that were initially in the combined list, and the item variable holds the first item that was in the combined list. If the combined list is not empty, the combined list remains not empty and `current_profit` is assigned the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged. All other variables remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while combined:
    item = combined.pop()
    if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
        current_profit -= item[1]
    else:
        current_profit += item[0]
    removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
    if removed_item:
        current_profit -= removed_item[0]
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *The loop counter `_` is equal to the number of iterations `k`, the heap contains all items that were initially in the combined list except the first item and the item that was removed from the heap, the item variable holds the first item that was in the combined list, the combined list contains all items except the first item, the removed_item variable holds the item that was removed from the heap, and the current_profit has been decreased by the first element of the removed item if the removed_item is not empty. If the current_profit was higher than the max_profit, the max_profit is updated to be equal to the current_profit. Otherwise, the max_profit remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *The loop counter `_` is equal to the number of iterations `k`, the heap contains all items that were initially in the combined list except the first two items, the item variable holds the second item that was in the combined list, the combined list contains at least one item less than before. If the removed_item variable is not empty, the removed_item variable holds the item that was removed from the heap and is equal to the smallest item in the heap after the push operation, and the current_profit has been decreased by the first element of the removed_item variable. The max_profit is updated to be equal to the current_profit if the current_profit was higher than the max_profit before the change, otherwise the max_profit remains unchanged. If the removed_item variable is empty, the state of the variables remains the same as before the if statement, with the current_profit and max_profit unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: The loop counter `_` is equal to the number of iterations `k`, the heap contains all items that were initially in the combined list except the first three items and the item that was removed from the heap and is equal to the smallest item in the heap after the push operation, the item variable holds the third item that was in the combined list, the combined list contains at least one item, the removed_item variable holds the item that was removed from the heap and is equal to the smallest item in the heap after the push operation. If the removed_item exists, the current_profit is decreased by the first element of the removed_item. The max_profit is updated to be equal to the current_profit if the current_profit is higher than the max_profit after the change, otherwise the max_profit remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
