Output State: **The function has access to functions func_1() and func_2() and func_3() and heapq module, test_cases is a non-negative integer.**

The code assigns the return value of `func_1()` to the variable `test_cases`. Since `func_1()` returns a non-negative integer, `test_cases` is now a non-negative integer. The other functions and the heapq module are still accessible, but their states remain unchanged.
