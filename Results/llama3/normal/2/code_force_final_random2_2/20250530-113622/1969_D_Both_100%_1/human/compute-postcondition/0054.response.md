Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `combined` is empty, `heap` contains the smallest tuple from the original `combined` list, `current_profit` is the maximum profit that can be obtained by removing items from `combined` and adding them to `heap`, and `max_profit` is the maximum profit that can be obtained by removing items from `combined` and adding them to `heap`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variables have reached their final state. The `combined` list is now empty, indicating that all items have been removed and added to the `heap`. The `heap` contains the smallest tuple from the original `combined` list, which represents the maximum profit that can be obtained. The `current_profit` variable has been updated to reflect the maximum profit that can be obtained by removing items from `combined` and adding them to `heap`. The `max_profit` variable has also been updated to reflect the maximum profit that can be obtained. The other variables, such as `test_cases`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, and `remaining_items`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
