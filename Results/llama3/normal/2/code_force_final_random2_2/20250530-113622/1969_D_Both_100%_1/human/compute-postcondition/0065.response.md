Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `k` is greater than 1, `n` is a new value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of new values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices corresponding to the new prices, `bonuses` is a list of new values returned by `func_2()`, `remaining_items` is an empty list. If `combined` is not empty, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing negative prices and corresponding bonuses with two less elements, `heap` is a list containing two tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus, `current_profit` is 0, and `max_profit` is 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
