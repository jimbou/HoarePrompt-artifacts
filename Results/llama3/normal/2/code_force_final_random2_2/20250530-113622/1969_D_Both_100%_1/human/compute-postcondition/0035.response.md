Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `combined` is not empty and has at least one item less than before, `item` is the last item that was in `combined`, `removed_item` is either empty or the item with the smallest value in `heap` or `item` if `item` has a smaller value than the smallest item in `heap`, `heap` now contains `item` if `item` has a smaller value than the smallest item in `heap`, otherwise it remains unchanged, and `current_profit` is decreased by the value of the first element of `removed_item`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the code has removed one item from the `combined` list and assigned it to the `item` variable. The other variables remain unchanged, except for the possible updates to `removed_item`, `heap`, `current_profit`, and `max_profit` based on the conditions specified in the initial state.
