Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `combined` is not empty but has one less item than before, `item` is the last item that was in `combined`. If the sum of the first two elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is decreased by the second element of `item`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by the first element of `item`.***
