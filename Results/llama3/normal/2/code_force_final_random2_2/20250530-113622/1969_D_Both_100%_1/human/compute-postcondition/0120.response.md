Output State: **`_` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `test_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is a value returned by func_2, `prices` is a list of values returned by func_2, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by func_2, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `heap` is a list containing the last item that was in `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing neg_prices and bonuses and has two less items than before, `item` is the last item that was in combined.**

In this output state, the code has removed the last item from the `combined` list and added it to the `heap` list. The `combined` list now has two less items than before, and the `item` variable now holds the last item that was in `combined`. The other variables remain unchanged.
