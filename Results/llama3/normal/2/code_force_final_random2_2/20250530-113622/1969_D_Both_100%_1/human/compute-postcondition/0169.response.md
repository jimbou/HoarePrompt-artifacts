The code prints the value of `max_profit` which is the maximum profit that was obtained during the process. The `max_profit` is either the current maximum profit or the updated maximum profit if the current profit was higher than the previous maximum profit.
Output: **The loop counter `_` is equal to the number of iterations `k`, the heap contains all items that were initially in the combined list except the first `k` items and the items that were removed from the heap, the item variable holds the last item that was in the combined list, the combined list is empty, the removed_item variable holds the item that was removed from the heap and is equal to the smallest item in the heap after the push operation, and the current_profit has been decreased by the first element of the removed_item if the removed_item is not empty. If the current_profit was higher than the max_profit, the max_profit is updated to be equal to the current_profit. Otherwise, the max_profit remains unchanged, and max_profit is printed**
