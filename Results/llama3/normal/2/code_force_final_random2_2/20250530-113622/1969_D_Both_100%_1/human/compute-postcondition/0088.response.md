Output State: **`_` is equal to `k`, `heap` is a list containing `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus, `item` is a tuple of negative price and corresponding bonus, `combined` has one less item, `func_3(combined, heap)` is called. If `removed_item` exists, the current value of `current_profit` is decreased by the negative price of `removed_item`. If the sum of the price and bonus of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, then the current value of `current_profit` is greater than or equal to `max_profit` minus the bonus of `item`. Otherwise, the current value of `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit` and is increased by the negative price of `item` minus the negative price of `removed_item` if `removed_item` exists. If `removed_item` does not exist, the current value of `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit` and is increased by the negative price of `item`. Additionally, the current value of `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, and `max_profit` is equal to the current value of `current_profit`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `max_profit` is now equal to the current value of `current_profit`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
