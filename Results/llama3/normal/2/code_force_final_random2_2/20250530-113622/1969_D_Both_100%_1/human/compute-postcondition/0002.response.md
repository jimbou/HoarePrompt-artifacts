Output State: **The function has access to functions func_1() and func_2() and func_3() and heapq module, test_cases is greater than 0, _ is 0, heap is an empty list, remaining_items is an empty list, n and k are values returned by func_2(), prices is a list of values returned by func_2(), neg_prices is a list of negative prices, bonuses is a list of values returned by func_2(), max_profit is 0, current_profit is 0, combined is a sorted list of tuples containing negative prices and corresponding bonuses.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The function still has access to the three functions func_1(), func_2(), and func_3(), as well as the heapq module. The variable test_cases remains greater than 0, and the variable _ is still 0. Two new empty lists, heap and remaining_items, have been created. The variables n and k have been assigned values returned by the function func_2(). A list of prices has been created from the values returned by func_2(), and a list of negative prices has been derived from the prices list. Another list of bonuses has been created from the values returned by func_2(). The variables max_profit and current_profit have been initialized to 0. Finally, a list of tuples containing negative prices and corresponding bonuses has been created and sorted based on the bonuses.
