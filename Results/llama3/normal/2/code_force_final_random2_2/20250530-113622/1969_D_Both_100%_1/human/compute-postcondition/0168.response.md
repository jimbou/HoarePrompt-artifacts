Based on the initial state, the `print(max_profit)` statement will print the maximum profit that was achieved during the process.

The `max_profit` variable is updated to be equal to the `current_profit` if the `current_profit` is higher than the `max_profit`. Otherwise, the `max_profit` remains unchanged. Since the `current_profit` has been decreased by the first element of the `removed_item` if the `removed_item` is not empty, the `max_profit` will be the maximum value of the `current_profit` before any decreases.

The `removed_item` variable holds the item that was removed from the heap and is equal to the smallest item in the heap after the push operation. This means that the `removed_item` is the smallest item that was removed from the heap, and its first element is the smallest value that was subtracted from the `current_profit`.

The `current_profit` has been decreased by the first element of the `removed_item` if the `removed_item` is not empty. This means that the `current_profit` has been decreased by the smallest value that was removed from the heap.

Since the `max_profit` is updated to be equal to the `current_profit` if the `current_profit` is higher than the `max_profit`, the `max_profit` will be the maximum value of the `current_profit` before any decreases.

Therefore, the `print(max_profit)` statement will print the maximum profit that was achieved during the process, which is the maximum value of the `current_profit` before any decreases.

Output: **max_profit (where max_profit is the maximum profit achieved during the process)**
