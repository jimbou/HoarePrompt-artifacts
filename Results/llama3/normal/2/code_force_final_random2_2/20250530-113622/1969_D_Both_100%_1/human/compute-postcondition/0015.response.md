Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing negative prices and corresponding bonuses, but with `k` less elements than before, `heap` contains the smallest tuple from the original `combined` list, and `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`.**

In this output state, the value of `current_profit` has been updated to the value returned by the function `func_3(combined, heap)`, which takes the updated `combined` list and the smallest tuple from the original `combined` list as input. The other variables remain unchanged.
