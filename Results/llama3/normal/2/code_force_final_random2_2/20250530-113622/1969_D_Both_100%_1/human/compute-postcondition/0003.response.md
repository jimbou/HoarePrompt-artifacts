To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `k`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `_` is the loop variable, it will take on values from 0 to `k-1` during the loop iterations.

State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing negative prices and corresponding bonuses**
