Output State: **`_` is equal to `k`, `heap` is a list containing `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus, `combined` has at least one item less than before, `item` is the last item that was in `combined`, `func_3(combined, heap)` is called, If `removed_item` exists, `current_profit` is decreased by the negative price of `removed_item` and then increased by the negative price of `item`. If the sum of the price and bonus of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, then `current_profit` is greater than or equal to `max_profit` minus the bonus of `item`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit` and is increased by the negative price of `item` minus the negative price of `removed_item` if `removed_item` exists. If `removed_item` does not exist, `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit` and is increased by the negative price of `item`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `current_profit` is increased by the negative price of `item`. If `removed_item` exists, the increase in `current_profit` is the difference between the negative price of `item` and the negative price of `removed_item`. If `removed_item` does not exist, the increase in `current_profit` is the negative price of `item`. The values of other variables remain the same.
