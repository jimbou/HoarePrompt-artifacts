Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `remaining_items` is an empty list. If `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains the smallest tuple from the original `combined` list, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing negative prices and corresponding bonuses, but with `k` less elements than before. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.***
