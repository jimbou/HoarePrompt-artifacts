Output State: **`_` is equal to `k`, `heap` is a list containing `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus, `item` is a tuple of negative price and corresponding bonus, `combined` has one less item, `removed_item` is the tuple with the smallest negative price in `heap` before pushing `item`, and `func_3(combined, heap)` is called. If the sum of the price and bonus of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, then `current_profit` is greater than or equal to `max_profit` minus the bonus of `item`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit` and is increased by the negative price of `item`.**

In this output state, the `heap` list has been updated by pushing the `item` tuple and popping the tuple with the smallest negative price, which is stored in `removed_item`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding `current_profit` and `max_profit` still hold.
