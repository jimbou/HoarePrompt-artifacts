The only variable in the loop head is variable combined, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable combined. If combined is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, combined has at least one item less than before, So for the loop to be executed one more time combined must have at least one item.
State: **`_` is equal to `k`, `heap` is a list containing `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus, `combined` has at least one item, `item` is the last item that was in `combined`, `func_3(combined, heap)` is called. If the sum of the price and bonus of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, then `current_profit` is greater than or equal to `max_profit` minus the bonus of `item`. If `removed_item` exists, `current_profit` is decreased by the negative price of `removed_item` and then increased by the negative price of `item` minus the bonus of `item` if the sum of the price and bonus of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise increased by the negative price of `item` minus the negative price of `removed_item`. If `removed_item` does not exist, `current_profit` is increased by the negative price of `item` minus the bonus of `item` if the sum of the price and bonus of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise increased by the negative price of `item`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`. If `removed_item` exists, `current_profit` is decreased by the negative price of `removed_item`.**
