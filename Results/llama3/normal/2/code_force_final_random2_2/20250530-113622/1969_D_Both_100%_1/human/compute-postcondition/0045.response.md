Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `combined` is not empty and has at least one item less than before, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` and has been removed from `combined`, `removed_item` is either empty or the item with the smallest value in `heap` or `item` if `item` has a smaller value than the smallest item in `heap`, `heap` now contains `item` if `item` has a smaller value than the smallest item in `heap`, otherwise it remains unchanged. If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, then `current_profit` is decreased by the value of the second element of `item`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by the value of the first element of `item`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `removed_item` is not empty, then `current_profit` is decreased by the value of the first element of `removed_item`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`.**

In this output state, the code has removed the last item from the `combined` list and assigned it to the `item` variable. The `combined` list now has one less item than before. The `item` variable now holds the value of the last item that was in `combined`. The `removed_item` variable remains unchanged, and the `heap` variable may or may not contain the `item` depending on its value. The `current_profit` and `max_profit` variables may have been updated based on the value of `item`.
