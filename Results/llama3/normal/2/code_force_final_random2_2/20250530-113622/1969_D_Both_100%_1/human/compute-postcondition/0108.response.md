Output State: **`_` is equal to `k`, `heap` is a list containing `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus, `combined` has at least one item less than before, `item` is the second last item that was in `combined` before popping the last item, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`. If `removed_item` exists, `current_profit` is updated by subtracting the price of `removed_item` from its previous value.**

In this output state, the value of `max_profit` has been updated to be equal to `current_profit`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `_` still equal to `k`, `heap` still containing `k` tuples of negative price and corresponding bonus, `combined` still having at least one item less than before, and `item` still being the second last item that was in `combined` before popping the last item. Additionally, if `removed_item` exists, `current_profit` has been updated by subtracting the price of `removed_item` from its previous value.
