To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition that allows the loop to execute. The loop head is `while combined:`, which means the loop will execute as long as `combined` is not empty.

Given the state right before the loop:

* `test_cases` is greater than 0
* `_` is equal to `k`
* `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`
* `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`
* `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices
* `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`
* `remaining_items` is an empty list
* If `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains the smallest tuple from the original `combined` list
* `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing negative prices and corresponding bonuses, but with `k` less elements than before
* If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged

Since the loop head only depends on the state of `combined`, we only need to adjust the state of `combined` to ensure the loop can execute.

According to the state, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing negative prices and corresponding bonuses, but with `k` less elements than before. This implies that `combined` might be empty if `k` is equal to the original number of elements in `combined`. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of `combined` to guarantee it is not empty.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `combined` must not be empty**
