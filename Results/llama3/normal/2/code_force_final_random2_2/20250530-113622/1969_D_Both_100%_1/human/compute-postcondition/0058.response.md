Output State: **test_cases is greater than 0, _ is equal to k + 1, n and k are new values returned by func_2(), prices is a list of new values returned by func_2(), neg_prices is a list of negative prices corresponding to the new prices, bonuses is a list of new values returned by func_2(), remaining_items is an empty list, combined is a sorted list of tuples containing negative prices and corresponding bonuses, heap is an empty list, current_profit is 0, and max_profit is 0.**

The code executes the following operations:

*   It calls `func_2()` to get new values for `n` and `k`.
*   It calls `func_2()` again to get a list of new prices and assigns it to `prices`.
*   It creates a list of negative prices (`neg_prices`) by multiplying each price in `prices` by -1.
*   It calls `func_2()` once more to get a list of new bonuses.
*   It initializes `max_profit` and `current_profit` to 0.
*   It combines `neg_prices` and `bonuses` into a list of tuples (`combined`) and sorts this list based on the bonuses.
*   It resets `heap` to an empty list.

The values of `test_cases` and `_` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The values of `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` are updated based on the new values returned by `func_2()`. The `combined` list is created and sorted, and `heap` is reset to an empty list. The `max_profit` and `current_profit` are initialized to 0.
