Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `combined` is not empty but has one less item than before, `removed_item` is the item with the smallest value in `heap` or `item` if `item` has a smaller value than the smallest item in `heap`, `heap` now contains `item` if `item` has a smaller value than the smallest item in `heap`, otherwise it remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `removed_item` is either the smallest item in `heap` or `item`, depending on which one has a smaller value. The `heap` now contains `item` if it has a smaller value than the smallest item in `heap`, otherwise it remains unchanged. The other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
