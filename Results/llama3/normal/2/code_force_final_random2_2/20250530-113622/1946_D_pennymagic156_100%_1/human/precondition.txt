stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). Each of the following lines contains either two integers n and x (1 <= n <= 10^5, 0 <= x < 2^30) or n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < 2^30). The number of lines containing two integers is equal to t. The number of lines containing n integers is equal to t.
