Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `x` is less than 2^30, `a` is a list of integers between 0 and 2^30, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is at least 0. If the i-th bit of `x` and the sum of the i-th bits of all elements in `a` are both 0, the program moves on to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the current iteration.***
