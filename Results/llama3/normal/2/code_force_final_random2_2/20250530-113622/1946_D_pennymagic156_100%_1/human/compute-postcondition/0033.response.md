Postcondition: **`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `x` is less than 2^30, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer between 0 and 2^30, `t` is a list, `ans` is an integer, `i` is at least 0, `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even and not equal to 0, `op` is 0, `cnt` is 0, and `val` is the first integer in the list `a`. The current value of `op` is 0, indicating that the first integer in the list `a` and the value of `i` have a specific relationship that results in `op` being 0.**
