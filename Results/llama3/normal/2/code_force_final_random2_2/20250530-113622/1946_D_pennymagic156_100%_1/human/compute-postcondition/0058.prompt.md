Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n and x are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^5 and 0 <= x < 2^30, a is a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30, t is an empty list, ans is -1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(29, -1, -1):
    u, v = x >> i & 1, sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])
    if u == v == 0:
        continue
    if u == 0:
        if v % 2:
            return ans
        else:
            op = ai = 0
            for val in a:
                op ^= val >> i & 1
                ai ^= val
                if not op:
                    t.append(ai)
                    ai = 0
            a, t = t, []
    elif v % 2:
        continue
    elif v:
        op = cnt = 0
        for val in a:
            op ^= val >> i & 1
            if not op:
                cnt += 1
        ans = max(ans, cnt)
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `x` is less than 2^30, `a` is a list of integers between 0 and 2^30, `t` is a list, `ans` is an integer, `i` is at least 0. If `u` is 0, then `a` is an empty list, `v` is an even number, `op` is 0, and `ai` is 0. If `u` is not equal to 0, then either `v` is odd and we move to the next iteration of the loop, or `v` is even and either `a` is an empty list, `op` is either 0 or 1, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and the length of the original list `a`, `val` is the last integer in the original list `a`, or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `x` is less than 2^30, `a` is a list of integers between 0 and 2^30, `t` is a list, `ans` is an integer, `i` is at least -1, `u` is either 0 or 1, `v` is the sum of the i-th bits of the integers in `a`. If `u` is 0, then `a` is an empty list, `op` is 0, and `ai` is 0. If `u` is not equal to 0, then either `v` is odd and we move to the next iteration of the loop, or `v` is even and either `a` is an empty list, `op` is either 0 or 1, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and the length of the original list `a`, `val` is the last integer in the original list `a`, or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `u` is equal to `v` and both are 0, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program does not execute the if part.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `x` is less than 2^30, `a` is a list of integers between 0 and 2^30, `t` is a list, `ans` is an integer, `i` is at least -2, `u` is the (i)-th bit of the integer `x`, `v` is the sum of the (i-1)-th bits of the integers in `a`. If `u` and `v` are both 0, then the program skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
