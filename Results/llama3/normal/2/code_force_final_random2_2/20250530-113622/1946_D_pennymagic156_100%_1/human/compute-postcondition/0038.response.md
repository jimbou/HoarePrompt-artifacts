Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `x` is less than 2^30, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers between 0 and 2^30, `t` is a list, `ans` is an integer, `i` is at least 0, `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even and not equal to 0, `op` is either 0 or 1, `cnt` is 2, `val` is the second integer in the list `a`.**

The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 2. The values of the other variables are not affected.
