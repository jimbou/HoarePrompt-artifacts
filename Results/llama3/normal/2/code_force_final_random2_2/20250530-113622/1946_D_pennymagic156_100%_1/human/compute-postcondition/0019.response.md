Postcondition: ***n is between 1 and 10^5, x is less than 2^30, a is a list of integers between 0 and 2^30 that must have at least 2 elements, t is a list, ans is an integer, i is at least 0, u is 0, v is an even number, val is the second element of a, op is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between its original value and the i-th bit of val, ai is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between its original value and val. If op is False, then t contains the result of the bitwise XOR operation between ai and val, and ai is 0.***
