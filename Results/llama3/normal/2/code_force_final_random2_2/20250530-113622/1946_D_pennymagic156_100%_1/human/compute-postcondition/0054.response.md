State: **`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `x` is less than 2^30, `a` is a list of integers between 0 and 2^30, `t` is a list, `ans` is an integer, `i` is at least -2, `u` is either 0 or 1, `v` is the sum of the (i-1)-th bits of the integers in `a`. If `u` is 0, then `a` is an empty list, `op` is 0, and `ai` is 0. If `u` is not equal to 0, then either `v` is odd and we move to the next iteration of the loop, or `v` is even and either `a` is an empty list, `op` is either 0 or 1, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and the length of the original list `a`, `val` is the last integer in the original list `a`, or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `u` is equal to `v` and both are 0, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program does not execute the if part.**
