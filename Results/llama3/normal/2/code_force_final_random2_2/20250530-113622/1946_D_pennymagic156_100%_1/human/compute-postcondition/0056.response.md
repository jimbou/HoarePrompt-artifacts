Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `x` is less than 2^30, `a` is a list of integers between 0 and 2^30, `t` is a list, `ans` is an integer, `i` is at least -2, `u` is the (i)-th bit of the integer `x`, `v` is the sum of the (i-1)-th bits of the integers in `a`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, all variables retain their original values and properties, as the `continue` statement only skips the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next one, without modifying any variables.
