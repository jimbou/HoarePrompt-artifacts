Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is between 1 and 10^5, `x` is less than 2^30, `a` is a list of integers between 0 and 2^30, `t` is a list, `ans` is an integer, `i` is at least 0, `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even and not equal to 0, `op` is 0, `cnt` is 0
Code of the loop:
for val in a:
    op ^= val >> i & 1
    if not op:
        cnt += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `x` is less than 2^30, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer between 0 and 2^30, `t` is a list, `ans` is an integer, `i` is at least 0, `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even and not equal to 0. If the first integer in the list `a` and the value of `i` have a specific relationship that results in `op` being 0, then `op` is 0, `cnt` is 1, and `val` is the first integer in the list `a`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `x` is less than 2^30, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers between 0 and 2^30, `t` is a list, `ans` is an integer, `i` is at least 0, `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even and not equal to 0, `op` is either 0 or 1, `val` is the second integer in the list `a`. If `op` is 0, then `cnt` is 2. Otherwise, `cnt` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `x` is less than 2^30, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers between 0 and 2^30, `t` is a list, `ans` is an integer, `i` is at least 0, `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even and not equal to 0, `val` is the third integer in the list `a`. If `op` is 0, `op` is flipped and `cnt` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
