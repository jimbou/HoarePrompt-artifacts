The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. Since the initial state does not specify any loop, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `x` is less than 2^30, `a` is a list of integers between 0 and 2^30, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is at least 0, `u` is 0, and `v` is 0. The program moves on to the next iteration of the loop.**
