#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers that were provided as input in the stdin, separated by spaces.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input and returns them as a list of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: an integer
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer that was provided as input from stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads an integer from standard input and returns it as output, effectively passing the input integer through the program without modification.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains a list of integers, where each integer is a value from the space-separated list of integers provided in the standard input (stdin).

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input and returns a map object containing the list of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a string
    return input().strip()
    #The program returns a string that was read from stdin, with leading and trailing whitespace removed.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a string from standard input, removes leading and trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string.

If `u` is 0, then `a` is an empty list, `v` is an even number, `op` is 0, and `ai` is 0. If `u` is not equal to 0, then either `v` is odd and we move to the next iteration of the loop, or `v` is even and either `a` is an empty list, `op` is either 0 or 1, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and the length of the original list `a`, `val` is the last integer in the original list `a`, or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
    return max(ans, len(a))
    #The program returns the maximum value between the integer `ans` and the length of the list `a`, where `a` is a list of integers between 0 and 2^30, and `ans` is an integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes no parameters and returns the maximum value between the length of a list of integers and a calculated integer value. The function iterates through the bits of an integer `x` and a list of integers `a`, performing bitwise operations and updating the list and integer values accordingly. The function returns the maximum value between the final length of the list `a` and the calculated integer value `ans`.
