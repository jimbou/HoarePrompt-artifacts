Output State: **n is between 1 and 10^5, x is less than 2^30, a is a list of integers between 0 and 2^30 that must have at least 2 elements, t is a list, ans is an integer, i is at least 0, u is 0, v is an even number, val is the second element of a, op is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between its original value and the i-th bit of val, ai is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between its original value and val.**

The code snippet performs two bitwise XOR operations. The first operation updates the value of `op` by XORing it with the i-th bit of `val`. The second operation updates the value of `ai` by XORing it with `val`. The values of `n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `i`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged.
