Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `x` is less than 2^30, `a` is a list of integers between 0 and 2^30, `t` is a list, `ans` is an integer, `i` is at least 0, `u` is not equal to 0. If `v` is not equal to 0, then `a` is an empty list, `op` is either 0 or 1, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and the length of the original list `a`, `val` is the last integer in the original list `a`. If `v` is 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
