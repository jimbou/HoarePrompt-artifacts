Postcondition: ***n is between 1 and 10^5, x is less than 2^30, a is a list of integers between 0 and 2^30 that must have at least 1 element, t is a list, ans is an integer, i is at least 0, u is 0, v is an even number. If op is 0, then t includes the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the original value of ai and val, op is 0, and ai is 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
