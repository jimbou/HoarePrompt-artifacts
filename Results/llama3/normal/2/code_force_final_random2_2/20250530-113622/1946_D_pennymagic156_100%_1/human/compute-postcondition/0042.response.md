Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `x` is less than 2^30, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers between 0 and 2^30, `t` is a list, `ans` is an integer, `i` is at least 0, `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even and not equal to 0, `op` is either 0 or 1 (flipped if the `i`-th bit of `val` is 1), `val` is the third integer in the list `a`, and `cnt` is either 2 or 3 (depending on the new value of `op`).**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 2 or 3, depending on the previous value of `op`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
