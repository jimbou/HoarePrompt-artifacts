The code `continue` skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there is no assignment or modification of variables in the given code, the values of all variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `x` is less than 2^30, `a` is a list of integers between 0 and 2^30, `t` is a list, `ans` is an integer, `i` is at least 0, `u` is not equal to 0, and `v` is odd. We move to the next iteration of the loop.**
