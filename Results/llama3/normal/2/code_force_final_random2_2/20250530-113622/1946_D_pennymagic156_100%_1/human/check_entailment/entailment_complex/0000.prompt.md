Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

# Annotated Functions:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
for _ in range(int(input())):
    print(func_5())

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers that were provided as input in the stdin, separated by spaces.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input and returns them as a list of integers.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: an integer
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer that was provided as input from stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads an integer from standard input and returns it as output, effectively passing the input integer through the program without modification.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains a list of integers, where each integer is a value from the space-separated list of integers provided in the standard input (stdin).

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input and returns a map object containing the list of integers.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a string
    return input().strip()
    #The program returns a string that was read from stdin, with leading and trailing whitespace removed.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a string from standard input, removes leading and trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and x are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^5 and 0 <= x < 2^30. The function func_3() returns a tuple of two integers (n, x) and the function func_1() returns a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30.
    n, x = func_3()

    #State: `n` is between 1 and 10^5, `x` is less than 2^30, `a` is a list of integers between 0 and 2^30, `t` is a list, `ans` is an integer, `i` is -30. If `u` is 0, then `a` is an empty list, `v` is an even number, `op` is 0, and `ai` is 0. If `u` is not equal to 0, then either `v` is odd and we move to the next iteration of the loop, or `v` is even and either `a` is an empty list, `op` is either 0 or 1, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and the length of the original list `a`, `val` is the last integer in the original list `a`, or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
    return max(ans, len(a))
    #The program returns the maximum value between the integer `ans` and the length of the list `a`, where `a` is a list of integers between 0 and 2^30, and `ans` is an integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes no parameters and returns the maximum value between the length of a list of integers and a calculated integer value. The function iterates through the bits of an integer `x` and a list of integers `a`, performing bitwise operations and updating the list and integer values accordingly. The function returns the maximum value between the final length of the list `a` and the calculated integer value `ans`.
