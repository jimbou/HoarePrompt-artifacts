Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `x` is less than 2^30, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers between 0 and 2^30, `t` is a list, `ans` is an integer, `i` is at least 0, `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even and not equal to 0, `val` is the third integer in the list `a`. If `op` is 0, `op` is flipped and `cnt` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
