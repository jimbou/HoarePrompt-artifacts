Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is between 1 and 10^5, `x` is less than 2^30, `a` is a list of integers between 0 and 2^30, `t` is a list, `ans` is an integer, `i` is at least 0, `u` is 0, `v` is an even number, `op` is 0, `ai` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for val in a:
    op ^= val >> i & 1
    ai ^= val
    if not op:
        t.append(ai)
        ai = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is between 1 and 10^5, x is less than 2^30, a is a list of integers between 0 and 2^30 that must have at least 1 element, t is a list, ans is an integer, i is at least 0, u is 0, v is an even number. If op is 0, then t includes the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the original value of ai and val, op is 0, and ai is 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is between 1 and 10^5, x is less than 2^30, a is a list of integers between 0 and 2^30 that must have at least 2 elements, t is a list, ans is an integer, i is at least 0, u is 0, v is an even number, val is the second element of a, op is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between its original value and the i-th bit of val, ai is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between its original value and val. If op is False, then t contains the result of the bitwise XOR operation between ai and val, and ai is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is between 1 and 10^5, x is less than 2^30, a is a list of integers between 0 and 2^30 that must have at least 3 elements, ans is an integer, i is at least 0, u is 0, v is an even number, val is the third element of a. If op is False, then t contains the result of the bitwise XOR operation between ai and val, and ai is 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
