Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `x` is less than 2^30, `a` is a list of integers between 0 and 2^30, `t` is a list, `ans` is an integer, `i` is at least -2, `u` is the (i)-th bit of the integer `x`, `v` is the sum of the (i-1)-th bits of the integers in `a`. If `u` and `v` are both 0, then the program skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statement.***
