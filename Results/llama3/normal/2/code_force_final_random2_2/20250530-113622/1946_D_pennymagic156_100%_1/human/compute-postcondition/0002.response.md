Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `x` is less than 2^30, `a` is a list of integers between 0 and 2^30, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is at least 0, `u` is the i-th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the i-th bits of all elements in `a`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The new variables `u` and `v` are introduced. `u` is assigned the value of the i-th bit of `x`, which is obtained by shifting `x` to the right by `i` bits and then performing a bitwise AND operation with 1. `v` is assigned the sum of the i-th bits of all elements in `a`, which is calculated by iterating over each element in `a`, shifting it to the right by `i` bits, performing a bitwise AND operation with 1, and summing up the results.
