The code snippet modifies the string `s` and the integer `ans`. The first line of code removes the substring 'map' from `s` by finding its index and slicing the string to exclude it. The second line increments the value of `ans` by 1.

Output State: **s is the original string with 'map' removed, ans is 2**
