Output State: **s is a string that contains no 'pie', ans is the number of 'map' in the original string plus 3**

Explanation:

The first line of code removes the substring 'pie' from the string s. Since s originally contained 'pie', this line effectively removes 'pie' from s, resulting in a new string that does not contain 'pie'.

The second line increments the value of ans by 1. Since ans was originally the number of 'map' in the original string plus 2, this line increases the value of ans by 1, making it the number of 'map' in the original string plus 3.

Therefore, after executing the entire code block, the final state is that s is a string that contains no 'pie', and ans is the number of 'map' in the original string plus 3.
