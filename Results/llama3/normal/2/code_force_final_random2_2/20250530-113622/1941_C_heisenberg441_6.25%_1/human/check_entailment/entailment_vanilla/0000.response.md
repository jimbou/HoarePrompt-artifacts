Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a string to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

The function first checks if the input string is equal to "mapie", in which case it returns 1. This is because the string "mapie" contains both "map" and "pie", and deleting one character can make it beautiful.

If the input string is not "mapie", the function enters a while loop that continues until the string no longer contains the substring "map". In each iteration of the loop, the function finds the index of the first occurrence of "map" in the string, removes the first two characters of "map" (i.e., "ma"), and increments the count of deleted characters.

After the while loop, the function enters another while loop that continues until the string no longer contains the substring "pie". In each iteration of the loop, the function finds the index of the first occurrence of "pie" in the string, removes the first two characters of "pie" (i.e., "pi"), and increments the count of deleted characters.

Finally, the function returns the total count of deleted characters.

The main part of the program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the length of the string and the string itself. It then calls the `func_1` function with the string as input and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
