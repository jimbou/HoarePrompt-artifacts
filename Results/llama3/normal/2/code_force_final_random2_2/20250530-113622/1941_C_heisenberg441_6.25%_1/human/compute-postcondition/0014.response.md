Output State: **s is a string that contains no 'pie', ans is the number of 'map' in the original string plus 2**

Explanation:

The first line of code removes the substring 'pie' from the string s. This is done by finding the index of 'pie' in the string and then concatenating the substrings before and after 'pie'. The result is a new string that does not contain 'pie'.

The second line increments the variable ans by 1. Since ans was initially the number of 'map' in the original string plus 1, it now becomes the number of 'map' in the original string plus 2.

Therefore, after executing the entire code block, the final state is that s is a string that contains no 'pie', and ans is the number of 'map' in the original string plus 2.
