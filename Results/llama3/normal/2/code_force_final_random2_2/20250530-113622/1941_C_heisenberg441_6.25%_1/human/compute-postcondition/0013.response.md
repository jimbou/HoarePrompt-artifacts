According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable s. If s.find('pie') != -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, s is the original string with all 'map' and 'pie' removed. This means that s.find('pie') will always be -1, so the loop cannot execute again. To make the loop execute one more time, s needs to be adjusted to a string that contains 'pie'. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **s is a string that contains 'pie', ans is the number of 'map' in the original string plus 1**
