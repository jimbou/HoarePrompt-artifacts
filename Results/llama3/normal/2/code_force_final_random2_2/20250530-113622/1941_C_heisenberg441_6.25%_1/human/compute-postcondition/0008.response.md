The variable in the loop head is s, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable s. If s.find('map') is not equal to -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, s is the original string with 'map' removed. So for the loop to be executed one more time s must contain 'map' again.
State: **s is the original string with 'map' removed and s must contain 'map', ans is 2**
