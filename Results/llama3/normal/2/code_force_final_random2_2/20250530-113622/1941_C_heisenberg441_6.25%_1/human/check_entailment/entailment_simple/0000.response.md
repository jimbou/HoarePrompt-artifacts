Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a given string to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

The program defines a function `func_1(s)` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

The function first checks if the input string `s` is equal to "mapie". If it is, the function returns 1, indicating that one character needs to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

If the input string is not equal to "mapie", the function initializes a variable `ans` to 0 and enters a while loop that continues until all occurrences of "map" have been removed from the string. In each iteration of the loop, the function finds the first occurrence of "map" in the string, removes the first two characters of the occurrence, and increments the `ans` variable by 1.

After all occurrences of "map" have been removed, the function enters another while loop that continues until all occurrences of "pie" have been removed from the string. In each iteration of the loop, the function finds the first occurrence of "pie" in the string, removes the first two characters of the occurrence, and increments the `ans` variable by 1.

Finally, the function returns the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

The program then reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` for each test case, and calls the `func_1(s)` function to compute the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The program prints the result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
