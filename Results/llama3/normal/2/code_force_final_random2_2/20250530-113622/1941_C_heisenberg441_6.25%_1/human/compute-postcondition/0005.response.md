The code snippet provided modifies the string `s` and the integer `ans`. The first line of code removes the substring 'map' from `s` by finding its index and slicing the string to exclude the characters 'm' and 'a' and 'p'. The second line increments the value of `ans` by 1.

Output State: **s is a string with 'map' removed, ans is 1**
