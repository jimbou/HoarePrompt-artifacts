Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the string contains both "map" and "pie" substrings, and removing one of them would make the string beautiful, but the program removes both, resulting in an incorrect count.

For example, the input string "mapie" should return 1, but the program returns 2. The correct solution should check if removing one of the substrings would make the string beautiful, and if so, return 1.
