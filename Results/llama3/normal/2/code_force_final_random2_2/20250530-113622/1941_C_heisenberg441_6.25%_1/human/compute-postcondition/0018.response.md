Output State: **The program returns the number of 'map' in the original string.**

Since 's' is a string that contains no 'pie', the number of 'pie' in the original string is 0. Therefore, 'ans' is equal to the number of 'map' in the original string plus 0, which simplifies to just the number of 'map' in the original string.
