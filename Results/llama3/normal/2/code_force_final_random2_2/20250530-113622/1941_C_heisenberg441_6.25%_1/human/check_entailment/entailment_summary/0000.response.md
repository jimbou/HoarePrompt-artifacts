Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly identifies the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The program first checks if the string is exactly 'mapie', in which case it returns 1. Otherwise, it counts the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the string and returns the total count. This is because removing one character from each occurrence of 'map' and 'pie' is sufficient to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
