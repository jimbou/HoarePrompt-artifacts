According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable s. If s.find('map') is not equal to -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, s is a string with 'map' removed, so for the loop to be executed one more time s must have 'map' again.
State: **s is a string with 'map' added, ans is 1**
