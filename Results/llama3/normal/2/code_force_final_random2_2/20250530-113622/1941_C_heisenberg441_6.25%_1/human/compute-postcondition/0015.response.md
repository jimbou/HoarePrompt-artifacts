The variable in the loop head is s, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable s. If s.find('pie') != -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, s is a string that contains no 'pie', so for the loop to be executed one more time s must contain 'pie'. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **s is a string that contains 'pie', ans is the number of 'map' in the original string plus 2**
