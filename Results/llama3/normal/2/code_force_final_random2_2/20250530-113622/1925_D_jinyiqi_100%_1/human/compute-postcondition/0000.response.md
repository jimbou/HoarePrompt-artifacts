The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, `t` becomes the number of test cases. The second line assigns the value of `10 ** 9 + 7` to `M`. This value is a constant and does not depend on any previous values.

Output State: **t is the number of test cases, M is 1000000007, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains an integer k, followed by k lines, each containing three integers n, m, and k, followed by m lines, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i.**
