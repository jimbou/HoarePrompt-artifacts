Output State: **t is greater than 1, i is 1, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is greater than 1, k is an integer, sum_f is equal to its original value plus f, a is an integer, b is an integer, f is an integer, j is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus m, cn2 is n * (n - 1) // 2, p is 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1) divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, q is 2 * cn2, and the integer value of p * pow(q, -1, M) % M has been printed.**

The code block reads three integers from the input, assigning them to `a`, `b`, and `f`. The value of `sum_f` is then incremented by the value of `f`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
