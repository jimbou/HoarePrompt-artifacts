Output State: **t is greater than 0, i is 0, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, sum_f is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each remaining test case contains an integer k, followed by k lines, each containing three integers n, m, and k, followed by m lines, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i.**

The first line of the code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables n, m, and k. This reduces the number of test cases in the input by one. The second line initializes the variable sum_f to 0. The values of t, i, and M remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
