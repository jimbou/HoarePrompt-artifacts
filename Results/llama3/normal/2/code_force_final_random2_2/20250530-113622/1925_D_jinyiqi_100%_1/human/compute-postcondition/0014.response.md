Output State: **t is greater than 1, i is 1, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is at least m, k is an integer, sum_f is 0, a is an integer, b is an integer, f is an integer, j is m-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus m-1, cn2 is n * (n - 1) // 2, p is 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1) divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, q is 2 * cn2, and this is printed: the integer value of p * pow(q, -1, M) % M.**

The code reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to n, m, and k. The value of sum_f is set to 0. The values of t, i, M, a, b, f, and j remain unchanged. The value of cn2 is updated based on the new value of n. The value of p is updated based on the new values of n, m, k, and sum_f. The value of q is updated based on the new value of n. The value of p * pow(q, -1, M) % M is printed.
