The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `M` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `sum_f` is equal to its original value plus `f`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `j` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `m`, `cn2` is `n` * (`n` - 1) // 2, `p` is 2 * `k` * `cn2` * `sum_f` + `m` * `k` * (`k` - 1) divided by the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, `q` is 2 * `cn2`, and the integer value of `p` * pow(`q`, -1, `M`) % `M` has been printed.**
