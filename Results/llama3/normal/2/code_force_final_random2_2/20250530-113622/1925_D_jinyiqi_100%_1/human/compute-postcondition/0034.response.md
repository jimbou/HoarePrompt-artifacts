Output State: **t is greater than 2, i is 2, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is 0, k is an integer, sum_f is the original value of sum_f plus the sum of all f values from stdin, a is the first integer from stdin, b is the second integer from stdin, f is the last integer from stdin, j is m, stdin contains multiple test cases minus m, cn2 is n * (n - 1) // 2, p is (2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd, q is (2 * cn2 squared) // gcd, gcd is the greatest common divisor of p and q, and the integer value of p * pow(q, -1, M) % M has been printed.**

The code modifies the values of `cn2`, `p`, `q`, and `gcd`. The first line recalculates `cn2` as `n * (n - 1) // 2`. The second line calculates `p` as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`. The third line calculates `q` as `2 * cn2 ** 2`. The fourth line calculates the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q` and assigns it to `gcd`. The fifth and sixth lines divide `p` and `q` by `gcd`, respectively. The value of `p * pow(q, -1, M) % M` has been printed, which is equivalent to `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) * pow((2 * cn2 squared), -1, M) % M`.
