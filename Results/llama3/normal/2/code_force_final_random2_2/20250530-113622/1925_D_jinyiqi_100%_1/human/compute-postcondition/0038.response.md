Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer k, followed by k lines of three integers each. It calculates a value based on these inputs and prints the result for each test case. The function performs the following actions: reads input, calculates the sum of certain values, computes the greatest common divisor of two values, and prints the result of a modular arithmetic operation. The function does not modify any input variables and does not have any side effects other than printing the results.**
