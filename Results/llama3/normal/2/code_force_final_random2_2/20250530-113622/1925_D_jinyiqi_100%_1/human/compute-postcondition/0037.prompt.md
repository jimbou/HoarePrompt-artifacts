Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is the number of test cases, M is 1000000007, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains an integer k, followed by k lines, each containing three integers n, m, and k, followed by m lines, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    sum_f = 0
    for j in range(m):
        a, b, f = map(int, input().split())
        sum_f += f
    cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2
    p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)
    q = 2 * cn2 ** 2
    gcd = math.gcd(p, q)
    p = p // gcd
    q = q // gcd
    print(int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0, i is 0, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is at least m, k is an integer, sum_f is equal to its original value plus the sum of all f values, a is an integer, b is an integer, f is an integer, j is m-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus m, cn2 is n * (n - 1) // 2, p is 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1) divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, q is 2 * cn2, and this is printed: the integer value of p * pow(q, -1, M) % M

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 1, i is 1, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer, sum_f is equal to its original value plus the sum of all f values, a is an integer, b is an integer, f is an integer, j is m, stdin contains multiple test cases minus m, cn2 is n * (n - 1) // 2, p is 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1) divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, q is 2 * cn2 squared divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, and the integer value of p * pow(q, -1, M) % M has been printed, gcd is the greatest common divisor of p and q, and the integer value of p * pow(q, -1, M) % M which is the integer value of (2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) * pow((2 * cn2 squared), -1, M) % M has been printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 2, i is 2, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is 0, k is an integer, sum_f is the original value of sum_f plus the sum of all f values from stdin, a is the first integer from stdin, b is the second integer from stdin, f is the last integer from stdin, j is m, stdin contains multiple test cases minus m, cn2 is n * (n - 1) // 2, p is (2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd, q is (2 * cn2 squared) // gcd, gcd is the greatest common divisor of p and q, and the integer value of p * pow(q, -1, M) % M has been printed, and the integer value of p * pow(q, -1, M) % M is printed, where p is (2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd, q is (2 * cn2 squared) // gcd, and M is 1000000007




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
