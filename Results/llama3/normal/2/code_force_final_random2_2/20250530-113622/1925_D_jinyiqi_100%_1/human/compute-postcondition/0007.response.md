The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `m` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `M` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 3, `k` is an integer, `sum_f` is equal to its original value plus the new value of `f`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `j` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three**
