To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `j` and `m`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is `m-1`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is 0. Also, `m` must be greater than 0.

State: **t is greater than 1, i is 1, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is greater than 0, k is an integer, sum_f is 0, a is an integer, b is an integer, f is an integer, j is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus m-1, cn2 is n * (n - 1) // 2, p is 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1) divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, q is 2 * cn2, and this is printed: the integer value of p * pow(q, -1, M) % M**
