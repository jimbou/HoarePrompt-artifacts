Output State: **t is greater than 1, i is 1, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is greater than 0, k is an integer, sum_f is equal to its original value plus f, a is an integer, b is an integer, f is an integer, j is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus m-1, cn2 is n * (n - 1) // 2, p is 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1) divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, q is 2 * cn2, and the integer value of p * pow(q, -1, M) % M has been printed.**

The code assigns the integer values of the input to `a`, `b`, and `f`. It then increments `sum_f` by the value of `f`. No other variables are affected. The values of `t`, `i`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `j`, `cn2`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged. The integer value of `p * pow(q, -1, M) % M` has been printed.
