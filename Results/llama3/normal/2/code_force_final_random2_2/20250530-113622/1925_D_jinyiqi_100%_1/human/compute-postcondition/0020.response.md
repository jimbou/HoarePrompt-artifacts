Output State: **t is greater than 1, i is 1, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is greater than 2, k is an integer, sum_f is equal to its original value plus f, a is an integer, b is an integer, f is an integer, j is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus m - 1, cn2 is n * (n - 1) // 2, p is 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1) divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, q is 2 * cn2, and the integer value of p * pow(q, -1, M) % M has been printed.**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer values of the input to a, b, and f. Since stdin contains multiple test cases minus m, after this line, stdin contains multiple test cases minus m - 1. The second line increments sum_f by the value of f. No other variables are affected.
