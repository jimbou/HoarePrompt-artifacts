The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `a`, `b`, and `f`, respectively. The second line increments `sum_f` by the value of `f`. 

Since `a`, `b`, and `f` are assigned new values from the input, their original values are overwritten. `sum_f` is incremented by the value of `f`, which is now an integer value from the input.

The values of `t`, `i`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus three.

Output State: **t is greater than 0, i is 0, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is at least 2, k is an integer, sum_f is equal to its original value plus the new value of f, a is an integer, b is an integer, f is an integer, j is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three**
