Output State: **t is greater than 1, i is 1, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer, sum_f is equal to its original value plus the sum of all f values, a is an integer, b is an integer, f is an integer, j is m, stdin contains multiple test cases minus m, cn2 is n * (n - 1) // 2, p is 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1) divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, q is 2 * cn2, and the integer value of p * pow(q, -1, M) % M has been printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the variable j has reached its final value of m. The sum of all f values has been accumulated in the variable sum_f. The other variables remain unchanged. The loop has printed the integer value of p * pow(q, -1, M) % M for each iteration.
