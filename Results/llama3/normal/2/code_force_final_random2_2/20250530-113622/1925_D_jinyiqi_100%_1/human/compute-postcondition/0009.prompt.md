Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0, i is 0, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, sum_f is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each remaining test case contains an integer k, followed by k lines, each containing three integers n, m, and k, followed by m lines, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    a, b, f = map(int, input().split())
    sum_f += f


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0, i is 0, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is at least 1, k is an integer, sum_f is equal to its original value plus f, a is an integer, b is an integer, f is an integer, j is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 0, i is 0, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is at least 2, k is an integer, sum_f is equal to its original value plus the new value of f, a is an integer, b is an integer, f is an integer, j is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 0, i is 0, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is at least 3, k is an integer, sum_f is equal to its original value plus the new value of f, a is an integer, b is an integer, f is an integer, j is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
