To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is the number of test cases, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, M is 1000000007, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains an integer k, followed by k lines, each containing three integers n, m, and k, followed by m lines, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i.**
