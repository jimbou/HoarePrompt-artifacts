State: **t is greater than 2, i is 2, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is greater than 1, k is an integer, sum_f is the original value of sum_f plus f, a is an integer, b is an integer, f is an integer, j is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus m minus 1, cn2 is n * (n - 1) // 2, p is 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1) divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, q is 2 * cn2 squared divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, and the integer value of p * pow(q, -1, M) % M has been printed, gcd is the greatest common divisor of p and q, and the integer value of p * pow(q, -1, M) % M which is the integer value of (2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) * pow((2 * cn2 squared), -1, M) % M has been printed**
