Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, i is t, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is 0, k is an integer, sum_f is the original value of sum_f plus the sum of all f values from stdin, a is the first integer from stdin, b is the second integer from stdin, f is the last integer from stdin, j is m, stdin contains multiple test cases minus m, cn2 is n * (n - 1) // 2, p is (2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd, q is (2 * cn2 squared) // gcd, gcd is the greatest common divisor of p and q, and the integer value of p * pow(q, -1, M) % M has been printed for each test case.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all test cases (i.e., i is equal to t), and the values of n, m, k, sum_f, a, b, f, j, stdin, cn2, p, q, and gcd have been updated accordingly. The loop has printed the integer value of p * pow(q, -1, M) % M for each test case. The state of the other variables in the precondition, such as M, remains unchanged.
