Output State: **t is greater than 0, i is 0, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is at least m, k is an integer, sum_f is equal to its original value plus the sum of all f values, a is an integer, b is an integer, f is an integer, j is m-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus m, cn2 is n * (n - 1) // 2, p is 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1) divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, q is 2 * cn2 ** 2 divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, gcd is the greatest common divisor of p and q.**

The code calculates the value of `cn2` as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, which is a combination of `n` and `n-1`. The value of `p` is calculated as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, which involves the variables `k`, `cn2`, `sum_f`, `m`, and `k-1`. The value of `q` is calculated as `2 * cn2 ** 2`, which involves the variable `cn2`. The greatest common divisor of `p` and `q` is calculated and stored in the variable `gcd`. The values of `p` and `q` are then divided by `gcd` to obtain their reduced forms. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
