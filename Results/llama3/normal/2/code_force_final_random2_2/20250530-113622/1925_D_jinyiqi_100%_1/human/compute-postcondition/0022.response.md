Output State: **t is greater than 1, i is 1, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer, sum_f is equal to its original value plus the sum of all f values, a is an integer, b is an integer, f is an integer, j is m, stdin contains multiple test cases minus m, cn2 is n * (n - 1) // 2, p is 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1) divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, q is 2 * cn2 squared divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, and the integer value of p * pow(q, -1, M) % M has been printed, gcd is the greatest common divisor of p and q.**

The code block modifies the values of `cn2`, `p`, `q`, and introduces a new variable `gcd`. The first line recalculates `cn2` as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, which is a new value based on the current value of `n`. The second line calculates `p` as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, using the newly calculated `cn2` and other existing variables. The third line calculates `q` as `2 * cn2 ** 2`, again using the new value of `cn2`. The fourth line calculates the greatest common divisor `gcd` of `p` and `q` using the `math.gcd` function. The fifth and sixth lines update `p` and `q` by dividing them by their greatest common divisor `gcd`, effectively reducing them to their simplest form. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
