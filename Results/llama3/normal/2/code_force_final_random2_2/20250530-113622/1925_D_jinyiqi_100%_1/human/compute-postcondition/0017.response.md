The only variable in the loop head is variable j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j and m. If j is less than m, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 0, m is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, j must be increased by 1, so j is 1 and for the loop to execute again m must be greater than 1.
State: **t is greater than 1, i is 1, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is greater than 1, k is an integer, sum_f is equal to its original value plus f, a is an integer, b is an integer, f is an integer, j is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus m-1, cn2 is n * (n - 1) // 2, p is 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1) divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, q is 2 * cn2, and the integer value of p * pow(q, -1, M) % M has been printed.**
