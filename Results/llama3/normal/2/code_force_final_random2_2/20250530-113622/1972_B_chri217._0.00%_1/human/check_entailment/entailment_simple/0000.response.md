Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The function `func_1` correctly determines who will win the game based on the number of facing-up coins. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win, and if it's even, Bob will win.

The reasoning behind this is that when a player removes a facing-up coin, they flip the two adjacent coins. If there are an odd number of facing-up coins, Alice can always remove a facing-up coin and flip the adjacent coins, leaving Bob with an even number of facing-up coins. Bob can then remove a facing-up coin and flip the adjacent coins, but he will always leave Alice with an odd number of facing-up coins. This process continues until there are no facing-up coins left, at which point the player who removed the last facing-up coin wins.

On the other hand, if there are an even number of facing-up coins, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins. This will leave Alice with an even number of facing-up coins, and the process will continue until there are no facing-up coins left, at which point Bob will win.

Therefore, the program correctly returns 'YES' if the number of facing-up coins is odd and 'NO' if it's even.

Correctness: **True**
