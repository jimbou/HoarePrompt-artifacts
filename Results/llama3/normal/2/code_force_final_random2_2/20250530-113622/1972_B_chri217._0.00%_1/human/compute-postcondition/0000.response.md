Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, consisting of only "U" and "D", where `n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 100), `num_up` is the number of 'U' in string `s`.**

In this output state, the value of `num_up` is the count of 'U' in the string `s`. The length of the string `s` and the range of `n` remain the same as in the initial state.
