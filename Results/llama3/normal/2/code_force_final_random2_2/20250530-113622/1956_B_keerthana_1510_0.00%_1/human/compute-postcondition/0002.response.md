To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the given information and the code step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `stdin` contains multiple test cases.
   - `open(0)` is a file object that must have at least 3 lines.
   - `line` is the third line.
   - `elements` is a list of strings split from the third line.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code `print(sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements}))` calculates and prints a value based on the `elements` list.
   - `{*elements}` creates a set from the `elements` list, which removes any duplicate elements because sets in Python only contain unique elements.
   - `for item in {*elements}` iterates over each unique element in the `elements` list.
   - `elements.count(item)` counts the occurrences of each unique `item` in the `elements` list.
   - `// 3` performs integer division by 3 on the count of each item, effectively grouping the counts into sets of three.
   - `sum(...)` adds up all these grouped counts.

3. **Output Description**:
   - The code prints the sum of the counts of each unique element in the `elements` list, divided into groups of three.
   - Since the exact content of `elements` (which comes from the third line of the input) is not specified, we cannot compute an exact numerical value.
   - However, the output represents the total number of complete groups of three for all unique elements found in the third line of the input.

**Output**: **The total count of complete groups of three for all unique elements in the third line of the input.**
