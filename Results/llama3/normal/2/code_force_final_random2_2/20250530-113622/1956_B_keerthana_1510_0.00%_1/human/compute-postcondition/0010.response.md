The code `elements = line.split()` splits the seventh line into substrings separated by whitespace characters and assigns them to the `elements` variable. The `split()` function splits a string into a list where each word is a list item. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases, `open(0)` is a file object that must have at least 7 lines, `line` is the seventh line, `elements` is a list of substrings separated by whitespace characters from the seventh line**
