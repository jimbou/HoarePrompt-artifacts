The only objects in the loop head are variable line and file object open(0). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the file object open(0). If the file object has at least 3 lines the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the file object must have at least 3 lines and the line is the third line.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, open(0) is a file object that must have at least 3 lines, line is the third line**
