Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the line where it calculates the sum of counts of each item divided by 3. This is incorrect because the problem states that each integer from 1 through n appears exactly twice in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Therefore, the correct calculation should be the sum of counts of each item divided by 2, not 3.

A correct implementation would be:

def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        elements = line.split()
        print(sum((elements.count(item) // 2 for item in {*elements})) - len({*elements}))

This corrected version calculates the sum of counts of each item divided by 2, and then subtracts the number of unique elements to get the correct answer.
