#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n) â€” the integers on the cards in your hand. Each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
    for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        elements = line.split()
        
        print(sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements}))
        
    #State: stdin contains multiple test cases, open(0) is a file object that must have at least 2 * 10^5 + 1 lines, line is the last line, elements is a list of substrings separated by whitespace characters from the last line, and the sum of the count of each unique item in elements divided by 3 is being printed

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. It then processes the second line of each test case, counting the occurrences of each unique integer and printing the sum of these counts divided by 3. The function does not modify the input or return any values, only printing the calculated sums to standard output.
