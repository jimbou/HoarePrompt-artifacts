Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, open(0) is a file object that must have at least 3 lines, line is the third line, elements is a list of strings split from the third line**

In this output state, the variable `elements` is assigned the list of strings split from the third line of the file object `open(0)`. The `split()` function splits the string into a list of substrings separated by whitespace characters. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, and the file object `open(0)` still has at least 3 lines.
