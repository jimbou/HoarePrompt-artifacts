Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 0, `a` is a string of length 4 consisting of letters A and B, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If the second character of the string `a` is 'A' and `j` is 'A', then `l` is 2 and `h` is 0. If the second character of the string `a` is 'A' and `j` is not 'A', then `l` is 1 and `h` is 1. If the second character of the string `a` is not 'A' and `j` is 'A', then `l` is 1 and `h` is 1. If the second character of the string `a` is not 'A' and `j` is not 'A', then `l` is 0 and `h` is 2.***
