Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 0, `a` is a string containing `t-1` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B if `l` > `h`, otherwise `a` is an empty string. `l` is the number of 'A's in the string `a` and `h` is the number of 'B's in the string `a`. If `l` > `h`, 'A' is printed. If `l` <= `h`, 'B' is printed.***
