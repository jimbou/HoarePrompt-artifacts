Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 32, i is 0, a is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, l is 0, h is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B
Code of the loop:
for j in a:
    if j == 'A':
        l += 1
    else:
        h += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 0, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If the first character of the string `a` is 'A', then `l` is 1 and `h` is 0. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `h` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 0, `a` is a string of length 4 consisting of letters A and B, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If the second character of the string `a` is 'A' and `j` is 'A', then `l` is 2 and `h` is 0. If the second character of the string `a` is 'A' and `j` is not 'A', then `l` is 1 and `h` is 1. If the second character of the string `a` is not 'A' and `j` is 'A', then `l` is 1 and `h` is 1. If the second character of the string `a` is not 'A' and `j` is not 'A', then `l` is 0 and `h` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 0, `a` is a string of length 4 consisting of letters A and B, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the second character of the string `a`. If `j` is 'A', `l` is increased by 1 and `h` is updated based on the new values of `j` and the second character of `a`. If `j` is not 'A', `l` and `h` are updated based on the new values of `j` and the second character of `a`, and `h` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
