Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 2, `a` has at least 3 characters, and the loop is processing the third character of `a`. If the first character of `a` is 'A' and the current character `j` is 'A', then `l` is 3 and `h` is 0. If the first character of `a` is 'A' and the current character `j` is not 'A', then `l` is 2 and `h` is 1. If the first character of `a` is not 'A' and the current character `j` is 'A', then `l` is 2 and `h` is 1. If the first character of `a` is not 'A' and the current character `j` is not 'A', then `l` is 0 and `h` is 3, `j` is the third character of `a`.**
