Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 1, `a` is a string of length 7 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 3 characters, `j` is the third character in the string `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is the number of 'A's in the string `a` plus 2 if the first character is 'A', or the number of 'A's in the string `a` plus 1 if the first character is 'B', and `h` is the number of 'B's in the string `a` plus 1 if the first character is 'A', or the number of 'B's in the string `a` plus 2 if the first character is 'B'. If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is the number of 'A's in the string `a` plus 1 if the first character is 'A', or the number of 'A's in the string `a` if the first character is 'B', and `h` is the number of 'B's in the string `a` plus 2 if the first character is 'A', or the number of 'B's in the string `a` plus 3 if the first character is 'B'.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `h` has been incremented by 1. The value of `h` now depends on the value of `j` and the first character of the string `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `h` is the number of 'B's in the string `a` plus 1 if the first character is 'A', or the number of 'B's in the string `a` plus 2 if the first character is 'B'. If `j` is not 'A', then `h` is the number of 'B's in the string `a` plus 2 if the first character is 'A', or the number of 'B's in the string `a` plus 3 if the first character is 'B'.
