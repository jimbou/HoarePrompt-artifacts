Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 0, `a` is a string of length 4 consisting of letters A and B, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If the second character of the string `a` is 'A', then `l` is 1 and `h` is 1. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `h` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `h` has been incremented by 1. If the second character of the string `a` is 'A', then `l` is 1 and `h` is now 1. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `h` is now 2. The values of the other variables remain the same.
