The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `a`. If `a` has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has 5 characters, `j` is the first character of `a`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string `a` must have at least 4 characters and the `j` is the second character of `a`.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 0, `a` is a string of length 4 consisting of letters A and B, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If the second character of the string `a` is 'A', then `l` is 1 and `h` is 0. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `h` is 1.**
