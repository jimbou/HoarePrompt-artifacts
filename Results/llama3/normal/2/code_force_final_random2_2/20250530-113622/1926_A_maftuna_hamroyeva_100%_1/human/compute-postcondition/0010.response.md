Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 32, `i` is 0, `a` is a string of length 4 consisting of letters A and B, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If the second character of the string `a` is 'A', then `l` is 2 and `h` is 0. Otherwise, `l` is 1 and `h` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1. If the second character of the string `a` is 'A', then `l` is now 2 and `h` remains 0. Otherwise, `l` is now 1 and `h` remains 1. The values of the other variables, `t`, `i`, `a`, and `stdin`, remain unchanged.
