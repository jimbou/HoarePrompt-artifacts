Correctness: **False** 

The program does not produce the correct output for all test cases. The issue is with the function func_1(). The function is supposed to return a string s such that all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of s. However, the function simply repeats the first k lowercase English alphabets n times, which does not guarantee that all possible strings of length n will occur as a subsequence.

For example, when n = 2 and k = 2, the function returns "abab", but this string does not contain all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets as subsequences. The correct output for this test case is "baab".
