Reasoning:

The problem requires finding a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. The program provided attempts to solve this problem by defining a function `func_1()` that takes no arguments, but uses the input values `n` and `k` from the global scope.

 Inside `func_1()`, the program defines a string `s` containing the first 26 lowercase English letters. It then returns the first `k` characters of `s` repeated `n` times.

The reasoning behind this approach is that by repeating the first `k` characters `n` times, the resulting string will contain all possible subsequences of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` characters. This is because each character in the repeated string will appear `n` times, allowing for all possible combinations of characters to be formed.

However, there is a flaw in this approach. The program does not consider the fact that the repeated string may contain duplicate subsequences. For example, if `n=2` and `k=2`, the repeated string would be `"abab"`, which contains the subsequence `"ab"` twice. This means that the program is not guaranteed to produce the shortest possible string that satisfies the problem constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
