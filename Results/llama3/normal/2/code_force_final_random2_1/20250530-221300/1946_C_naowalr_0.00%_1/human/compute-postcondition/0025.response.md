Output State: **t is a positive integer and at least 1, n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, z is 0, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where each list contains n-1 pairs of integers (a, b), i is n-2, x is an integer equal to (L + R) // 2, leftover is an integer equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1), L is an integer equal to (L + R) // 2, R is an integer between L + 2 and 100001, numCuts is 0**

In this output state, the value of L has been updated to be equal to x, which is the average of the original L and R. The other variables remain unchanged.
