Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `k` is a positive integer and `k` < `n`, `t` is a positive integer and at least 1, `z` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is an integer equal to `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is an integer equal to the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is an integer equal to `(L + R) // 2`, `R` is either greater than `(1 + 100001) // 2` or 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `adj` is an adjacency list with `n+1` lists where the a-th list contains `b` and the b-th list contains `a` for all pairs of integers `a` and `b` read from stdin, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `t`, `z`, `i`, `leftover`, `R`, `numCuts`, and `adj` remain unchanged. The value of `L` is updated to be equal to `x`, which is the average of the original `L` and `R`. The value of `x` remains the same, which is the average of the original `L` and `R`. There is no input left in stdin.
