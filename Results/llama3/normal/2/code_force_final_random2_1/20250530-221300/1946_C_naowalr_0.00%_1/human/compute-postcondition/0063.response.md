To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `k` is a positive integer and `k` < `n`, `adj` is an empty adjacency list with `n+1` lists, `t` is a positive integer and at least 2, `z` is 2, `i` is 0, `x` is an integer equal to `L`, `leftover` is an integer equal to the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is an integer and `R` is an integer and `R - L` is 1, `numCuts` is 0, `stdin` contains no input, and the value of `L` is being printed**
