Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `k` is a positive integer and `k` < `n`, `adj` is an adjacency list with `n+1` lists where `adj[a]` contains `b` and `adj[b]` contains `a` for all `n-1` pairs of integers `(a, b)` from the input, `t` is a positive integer and at least 2, `z` is 2, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is an integer equal to `(L + R) // 2`, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the last line of the input, `b` is an integer equal to the second integer from the last line of the input, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is an integer equal to the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, and the value of 1 is being printed. If `numCuts` > `k` or (`numCuts` == `k` and `leftover` >= `x`), then `L` is `(L + R) // 2` and `R` is `x`. Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is `x`. `R` must be at least 3 if `L` is 1, or `L + 2` if `L` is `(L + R) // 2`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `R` has been updated to be equal to `x`, which is the average of `L` and `R`. The conditions for updating `L` and `R` are still the same, but now `R` is equal to `x` instead of `100001`.
