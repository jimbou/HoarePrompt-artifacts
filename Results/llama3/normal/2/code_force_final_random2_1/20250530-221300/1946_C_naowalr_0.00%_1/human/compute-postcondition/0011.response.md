To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the condition `R - L > 1`. Given the initial states, `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001, which already satisfies the condition since `100001 - 1 > 1`. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states of `L` and `R` for the loop to execute the first time.

However, to strictly follow the task's requirement for the format and to explicitly state that no adjustments are necessary, we acknowledge that the initial conditions already meet the criteria for the loop to execute.

State: **t is a positive integer and at least 1, n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, z is 0, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where each list contains n-1 pairs of integers (a, b), i is n-2, stdin is empty, L is 1, R is 100001, numCuts is 0**
