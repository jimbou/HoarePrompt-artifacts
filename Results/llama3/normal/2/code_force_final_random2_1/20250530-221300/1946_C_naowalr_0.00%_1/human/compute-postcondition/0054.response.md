Output State: **n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, t is a positive integer and at least 1, z is 1, i is n-1, x is an integer equal to (L + R) // 2, leftover is an integer equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1), L is either 1 or (1 + 100001) // 2 - 2, R is either greater than (1 + 100001) // 2 or 100001, numCuts is 0, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where the a-th list contains b and the b-th list contains a for all pairs of integers a and b read from stdin, stdin contains no input.**

The code block does not modify the values of `n`, `k`, `t`, `z`, `i`, `L`, `R`, or `adj`. The first line assigns the value of `(L + R) // 2` to `x`, but since `x` already has this value, it remains unchanged. The second line sets `numCuts` to 0, which was already its value. The third line assigns the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` to `leftover`, but since the value of `leftover` is already equal to the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, it remains unchanged.
