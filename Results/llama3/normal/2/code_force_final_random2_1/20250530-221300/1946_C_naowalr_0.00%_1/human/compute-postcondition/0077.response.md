Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where adj[a] contains b and adj[b] contains a for all n-1 pairs of integers (a, b) from the input, t is a positive integer and at least 2, z is 2, i is n-1, x is an integer equal to (L + R) // 2, leftover is an integer equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1), a is an integer equal to the first integer from the last line of the input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the last line of the input, and the value of 1 is being printed. If numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), then L is (L + R) // 2 and R is 100001. Otherwise, L is 1 and R is (L + R) // 2.***
