To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer and at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `n` remains the same.

State: **t is a positive integer and at least 1, n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, z is 0, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where the first two lists contain a pair of integers (a, b) and the rest are empty, i is 1, stdin contains n-2 lines of pairs of integers (a, b) where 1 <= a, b <= n**
