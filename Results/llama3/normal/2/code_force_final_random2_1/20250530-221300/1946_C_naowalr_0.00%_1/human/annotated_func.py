#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k < n, and the next n-1 lines of stdin contain pairs of integers (a, b) where 1 <= a, b <= n.
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for z in range(t):
        n, k = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        
        adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
            adj[a].append(b)
            adj[b].append(a)
        
        L = 1
        
        R = int(100000.0 + 1)
        
        numCuts = 0
        
        while R - L > 1:
            x = (L + R) // 2
            numCuts = 0
            leftover = dfs(1, 1)
            if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
                L = x
            else:
                R = x

    #State: t is a positive integer and at least 1, n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, z is t-1, i is n-1, x is an integer equal to (L + R) // 2, leftover is an integer equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1), L and R are integers between 1 and 100001 and L = R, numCuts is 0, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where adj[a] contains b and adj[b] contains a for all n-1 pairs of integers (a, b) from the input, stdin contains no input, and the value of L is being printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the result. It takes no parameters and returns no value. The function reads a positive integer t, then for each test case, it reads a positive integer n and a positive integer k (k < n), and n-1 pairs of integers (a, b) where 1 <= a, b <= n. It constructs an adjacency list from the pairs and performs a binary search to find the minimum value L such that the number of cuts in the graph is greater than k or the number of cuts is equal to k and the leftover value is greater than or equal to L. The function prints the value of L.
