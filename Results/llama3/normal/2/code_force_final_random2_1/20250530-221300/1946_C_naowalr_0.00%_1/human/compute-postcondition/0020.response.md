Output State: **`t` is a positive integer and at least 1, `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `k` is a positive integer and `k` < `n`, `z` is 0, `adj` is an adjacency list with `n+1` lists where each list contains `n-1` pairs of integers (a, b), `i` is `n-2`, `x` is an integer between 1 and 100001, `leftover` is an integer, `L` is an integer equal to `x` which is equal to `(L + R) // 2`, `R` is an integer between 1 and 100001, `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k`, and `numCuts` is equal to the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`.**

In this output state, the value of `L` has been updated to be equal to `x`, which is also equal to `(L + R) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
