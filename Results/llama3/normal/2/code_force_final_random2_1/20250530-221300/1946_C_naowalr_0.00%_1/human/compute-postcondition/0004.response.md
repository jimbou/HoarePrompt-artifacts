Output State: **t is a positive integer and at least 1, n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, z is 0, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where the first two lists contain a pair of integers (a, b) and the rest are empty, i is 0, stdin contains n-2 lines of pairs of integers (a, b) where 1 <= a, b <= n**

The code reads a pair of integers (a, b) from stdin, adds b to the adjacency list of a and a to the adjacency list of b, and then does not affect any other variables. The value of t remains unchanged as a positive integer and at least 1. The value of n remains unchanged as a positive integer and at least 2. The value of k remains unchanged as a positive integer and k < n. The value of z remains unchanged as 0. The value of i remains unchanged as 0. Stdin now contains n-2 lines of pairs of integers (a, b) where 1 <= a, b <= n.
