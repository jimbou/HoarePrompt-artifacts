Output State: **n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, t is a positive integer and at least 1, z is 1, i is n-1, x is an integer equal to (L + R) // 2, leftover is an integer equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1), L and R are integers between 1 and 100001 and L = R, numCuts is 0, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where the a-th list contains b and the b-th list contains a for all pairs of integers a and b read from stdin, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is: The loop has finished reading all the edges of the graph from the standard input and has added them to the adjacency list. The loop counter i has reached its final value of n-1. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
