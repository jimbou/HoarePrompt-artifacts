Output State: **n is a positive integer and at least 3, k is a positive integer and k < n, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where adj[a] contains b and adj[b] contains a, t is a positive integer and at least 2, z is 2, i is 2, x is an integer equal to L, leftover is an integer equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1), L is an integer and R is an integer and R - L is 1, numCuts is 0, stdin contains no input, and the value of L is being printed, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, adj[a] contains b and adj[b] contains a.**

The code block reads two integers from the input, assigns them to `a` and `b`, and then appends `b` to `adj[a]` and `a` to `adj[b]`. This modifies the adjacency list `adj` by adding edges between `a` and `b`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
