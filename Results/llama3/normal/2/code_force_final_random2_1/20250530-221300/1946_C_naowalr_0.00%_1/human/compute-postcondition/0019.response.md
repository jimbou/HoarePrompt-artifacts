Output State: **t is a positive integer and at least 1, n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, z is 0, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where each list contains n-1 pairs of integers (a, b), i is n-2, x is an integer between 1 and 100001, leftover is an integer, L is an integer between 1 and 100001, R is an integer between 1 and 100001, numCuts is less than or equal to k, x is an integer equal to (L + R) // 2, and numCuts is equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1).**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `z`, `adj`, `i`, `x`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of `leftover` is updated to an integer, and `numCuts` is updated to be less than or equal to `k`. The value of `x` is updated to be the average of `L` and `R`, and `numCuts` is updated to be the value returned by the `dfs` function called with arguments `1` and `1`.
