Postcondition: **t is a positive integer and at least 1, n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, z is 0, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where each list contains n-1 pairs of integers (a, b), i is n-2, x is an integer equal to (L + R) // 2, leftover is an integer equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1), L and R are integers between 1 and 100001, numCuts is 0. If numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), then L is set to (L + R) // 2. Otherwise, R is set to (L + R) // 2.**
