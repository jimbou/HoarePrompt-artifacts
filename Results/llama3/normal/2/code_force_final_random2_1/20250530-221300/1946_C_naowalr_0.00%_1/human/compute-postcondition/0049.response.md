Output State: **n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, t is a positive integer and at least 1, z is 1, i is n-1, x is an integer equal to (L + R) // 2, leftover is an integer equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1), L is either 1 or (1 + 100001) // 2, R is either greater than (1 + 100001) // 2 or 100001, numCuts is 0, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where the a-th list contains b and the b-th list contains a for all pairs of integers a and b read from stdin, stdin contains no input.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `x`, `numCuts`, and `leftover`. The first line updates the value of `x` to be the average of `L` and `R`. The second line resets `numCuts` to 0. The third line assigns the result of the function call `dfs(1, 1)` to `leftover`. The values of `n`, `k`, `t`, `z`, `i`, `L`, `R`, `adj`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
