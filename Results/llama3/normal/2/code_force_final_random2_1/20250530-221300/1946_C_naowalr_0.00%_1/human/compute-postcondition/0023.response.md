To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `R` and `L` so that `R - L > 1` remains true.

At the end of the previous iteration, we have two possible scenarios:

1. `numCuts` > `k` or (`numCuts` == `k` and `leftover` >= `x`): In this case, `L` is updated to `x` which is equal to `(L + R) // 2`. This means `L` is increased, but `R` remains the same.

2. Otherwise, `R` is updated to `x` which is equal to `(L + R) // 2`. This means `R` is decreased, but `L` remains the same.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `R - L > 1` is still true. This means we need to adjust the values of `R` and `L` so that the difference between them is at least 2.

Since `R` and `L` are integers between 1 and 100001, we can adjust their values as follows:

* If `L` is increased in the previous iteration, we need to make sure that `R` is at least `L + 2`. Since `R` is an integer between 1 and 100001, we can set `R` to be at least `L + 2` and at most 100001.

* If `R` is decreased in the previous iteration, we need to make sure that `L` is at most `R - 2`. Since `L` is an integer between 1 and 100001, we can set `L` to be at most `R - 2` and at least 1.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

State: **`t` is a positive integer and at least 1, `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `k` is a positive integer and `k` < `n`, `z` is 0, `adj` is an adjacency list with `n+1` lists where each list contains `n-1` pairs of integers (a, b), `i` is `n-2`, `x` is an integer between 1 and 100001, `leftover` is an integer, `L` is an integer between 1 and 100001, `R` is an integer between `L + 2` and 100001, `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and is equal to the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`**
