To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `R` and `L` since they are the variables in the loop head. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `R - L > 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `R` is either 100001 or `(1 + 100001) // 2`, and `L` is either 1 or `(1 + 100001) // 2`. To guarantee that the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that `R - L > 1`.

If `R` is 100001 and `L` is 1, then `R - L` is already greater than 1, so no adjustment is needed.

If `R` is `(1 + 100001) // 2` and `L` is 1, then `R - L` is also greater than 1, so no adjustment is needed.

If `R` is 100001 and `L` is `(1 + 100001) // 2`, then `R - L` is greater than 1, so no adjustment is needed.

If `R` is `(1 + 100001) // 2` and `L` is `(1 + 100001) // 2`, then `R - L` is equal to 0, which does not satisfy the condition. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `R` to be greater than `(1 + 100001) // 2` or adjust `L` to be less than `(1 + 100001) // 2`.

Since we can only adjust the states of `R` and `L`, we can adjust `R` to be greater than `(1 + 100001) // 2` or adjust `L` to be less than `(1 + 100001) // 2`.

State: **n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, t is a positive integer and at least 1, z is 1, i is n-1, x is an integer equal to (1 + 100001) // 2, leftover is an integer equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1), L is either 1 or (1 + 100001) // 2, R is either greater than (1 + 100001) // 2 or 100001, numCuts is either greater than k or equal to k and leftover is greater than or equal to (1 + 100001) // 2, or less than or equal to k and if the number of cuts is equal to k, then the leftover is less than (1 + 100001) // 2, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where the a-th list contains b and the b-th list contains a for all pairs of integers a and b read from stdin, stdin contains no input.**
