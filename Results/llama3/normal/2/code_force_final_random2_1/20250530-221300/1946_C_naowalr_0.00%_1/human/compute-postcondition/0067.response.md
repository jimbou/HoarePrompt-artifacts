The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 3.
State: **n is a positive integer and at least 3, k is a positive integer and k < n, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where adj[a] contains b and adj[b] contains a, t is a positive integer and at least 2, z is 2, i is 2, x is an integer equal to L, leftover is an integer equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1), L is an integer and R is an integer and R - L is 1, numCuts is 0, stdin contains no input, and the value of L is being printed, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the input.**
