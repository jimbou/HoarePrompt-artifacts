Output State: **t is a positive integer and at least 1, n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, z is 0, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where each list contains n-1 pairs of integers (a, b), i is n-2, stdin is empty, L is 1, R is 100001, numCuts is 0**

In this output state, the values of t, n, k, z, adj, i, and stdin remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The code introduced three new variables: L, R, and numCuts. L was assigned the value 1, R was assigned the value 100001 (resulting from int(100000.0 + 1)), and numCuts was initialized to 0.
