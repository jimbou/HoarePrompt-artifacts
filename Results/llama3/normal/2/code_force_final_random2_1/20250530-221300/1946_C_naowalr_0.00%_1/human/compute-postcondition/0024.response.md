Output State: **t is a positive integer and at least 1, n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, z is 0, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where each list contains n-1 pairs of integers (a, b), i is n-2, x is an integer equal to (L + R) // 2, leftover is an integer equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1), L is an integer between 1 and 100001, R is an integer between L + 2 and 100001, numCuts is 0**

The code executes three lines. The first line assigns the value of `(L + R) // 2` to `x`, updating its value. The second line resets `numCuts` to 0. The third line assigns the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` to `leftover`, updating its value. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `z`, `adj`, `i`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
