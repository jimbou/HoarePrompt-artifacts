Output State: **t is a positive integer and at least 1, n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, z is t-1, i is n-1, x is an integer equal to (L + R) // 2, leftover is an integer equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1), L and R are integers between 1 and 100001 and L = R, numCuts is 0, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where adj[a] contains b and adj[b] contains a for all n-1 pairs of integers (a, b) from the input, stdin contains no input, and the value of L is being printed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times, with the only difference being the value of `z`, which is now `t-1` instead of `2`. This is because the loop iterates `t` times, and after the last iteration, `z` is incremented to `t-1`. The other variables in the loop head and body remain unchanged.
