Output State: **n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, t is a positive integer and at least 1, z is 1, i is n-1, x is an integer equal to L, leftover is an integer equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1), L is an integer and R is an integer and R - L is 1, numCuts is 0, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where the a-th list contains b and the b-th list contains a for all pairs of integers a and b read from stdin, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop terminates when the difference between R and L is 1. At this point, the values of L and R are the closest possible integers, with R being one more than L. The value of x is equal to L, and the value of leftover is the result of the dfs function. The other variables remain unchanged.
