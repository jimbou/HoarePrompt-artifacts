Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer and at least 1, n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, z is 0, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where each list contains n-1 pairs of integers (a, b), i is n-2, stdin is empty, L is 1, R is 100001, numCuts is 0
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer and at least 1, `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `k` is a positive integer and `k` < `n`, `z` is 0, `adj` is an adjacency list with `n+1` lists where each list contains `n-1` pairs of integers (a, b), `i` is `n-2`, `x` is an integer between 1 and 100001, `leftover` is an integer, and stdin is empty. If `numCuts` > `k` or (`numCuts` == `k` and `leftover` >= `x`), then `L` is an integer between 1 and 100001, and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, `L` is 1, and `R` is an integer between 1 and 100001, `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k`, and if `numCuts` is equal to `k`, then `leftover` is less than `R`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is a positive integer and at least 1, `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `k` is a positive integer and `k` < `n`, `z` is 0, `adj` is an adjacency list with `n+1` lists where each list contains `n-1` pairs of integers (a, b), `i` is `n-2`, `x` is an integer between 1 and 100001, `leftover` is an integer, `L` and `R` are integers between 1 and 100001, `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and is equal to the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`. If `numCuts` > `k` or (`numCuts` == `k` and `leftover` >= `x`), then `L` is equal to `x` which is equal to `(L + R) // 2`. Otherwise, `R` is equal to `x` which is equal to `(L + R) // 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is a positive integer and at least 1, n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, z is 0, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where each list contains n-1 pairs of integers (a, b), i is n-2, x is an integer equal to (L + R) // 2, leftover is an integer equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1), L and R are integers between 1 and 100001, numCuts is 0. If numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), then L is set to (L + R) // 2. Otherwise, R is set to (L + R) // 2.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
