To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `R` and `L` so that `R - L > 1` is true.

According to the code, `R` is either greater than `(1 + 100001) // 2` or `100001`, and `L` is either `1` or `(1 + 100001) // 2`. To guarantee that `R - L > 1`, we need to make sure that `R` is at least 3 more than `L`.

Since `L` is either `1` or `(1 + 100001) // 2`, we can't adjust `L` to be smaller. However, we can adjust `R` to be larger. If `R` is greater than `(1 + 100001) // 2`, it should be at least 3 more than `L`. If `R` is `100001`, it is already larger than `L`, but we need to make sure that `L` is not too close to `R`. Therefore, we can adjust `L` to be at most `(1 + 100001) // 2 - 2`.

State: **n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, t is a positive integer and at least 1, z is 1, i is n-1, x is an integer equal to (L + R) // 2, leftover is an integer equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1), L is either 1 or (1 + 100001) // 2 - 2, R is either greater than (1 + 100001) // 2 or 100001, numCuts is 0, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where the a-th list contains b and the b-th list contains a for all pairs of integers a and b read from stdin, stdin contains no input.**
