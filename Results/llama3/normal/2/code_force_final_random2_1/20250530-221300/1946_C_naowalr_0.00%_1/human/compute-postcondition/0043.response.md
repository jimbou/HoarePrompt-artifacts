Postcondition: **n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, t is a positive integer and at least 1, z is 1, i is n-1, x is an integer equal to (1 + 100001) // 2, leftover is an integer equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1), L is 1, R is 100001, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where the a-th list contains b and the b-th list contains a for all pairs of integers a and b read from stdin, stdin contains no input. The current value of numCuts is either greater than k or equal to k and the current value of leftover is greater than or equal to x.**
