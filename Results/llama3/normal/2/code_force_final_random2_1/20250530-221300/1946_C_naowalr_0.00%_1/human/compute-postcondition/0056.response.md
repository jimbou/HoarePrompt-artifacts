Output State: **n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, t is a positive integer and at least 1, z is 1, i is n-1, x is an integer equal to (L + R) // 2, leftover is an integer equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1), L is either 1 or (1 + 100001) // 2 - 2, R is equal to (L + R) // 2, numCuts is 0, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where the a-th list contains b and the b-th list contains a for all pairs of integers a and b read from stdin, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of n, k, t, z, i, leftover, L, numCuts, and adj remain unchanged. The value of R is updated to be equal to x, which is the average of L and R. The value of x remains the same, which is the average of the original L and R. The stdin still contains no input.
