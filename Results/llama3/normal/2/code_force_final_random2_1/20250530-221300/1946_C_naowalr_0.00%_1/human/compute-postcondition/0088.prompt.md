Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where adj[a] contains b and adj[b] contains a for all n-1 pairs of integers (a, b) from the input, t is a positive integer and at least 2, z is 2, i is n-1, x is an integer equal to 1, leftover is an integer equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1), L is 1, R is 100001, numCuts is 0, stdin contains no input, and the value of 1 is being printed, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the last line of the input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the last line of the input.
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where adj[a] contains b and adj[b] contains a for all n-1 pairs of integers (a, b) from the input, t is a positive integer and at least 2, z is 2, i is n-1, x is an integer equal to (L + R) // 2, leftover is an integer equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1), a is an integer equal to the first integer from the last line of the input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the last line of the input, and the value of 1 is being printed. If numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), then L is (L + R) // 2 and R is 100001. Otherwise, L is 1 and R is (L + R) // 2.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where adj[a] contains b and adj[b] contains a for all n-1 pairs of integers (a, b) from the input, t is a positive integer and at least 2, z is 2, i is n-1, x is an integer equal to (L + R) // 2, leftover is an integer equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1), a is an integer equal to the first integer from the last line of the input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the last line of the input, numCuts is 0, and the value of 1 is being printed. If numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), then L is (L + R) // 2 and R is 100001. Otherwise, L is 1 and R is (L + R) // 2. R must be at least 3 if L is 1, or L + 2 if L is (L + R) // 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where adj[a] contains b and adj[b] contains a for all n-1 pairs of integers (a, b) from the input, t is a positive integer and at least 2, z is 2, i is n-1, x is an integer equal to (L + R) // 2, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the last line of the input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the last line of the input, numCuts is 0, leftover is an integer equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1), and the value of 1 is being printed. If numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), then L is (L + R) // 2 and R is 100001. Otherwise, L is 1 and R is (L + R) // 2. R must be at least 3 if L is 1, or L + 2 if L is (L + R) // 2.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
