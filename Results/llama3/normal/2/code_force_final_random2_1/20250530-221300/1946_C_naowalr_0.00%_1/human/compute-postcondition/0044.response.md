Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `k` is a positive integer and `k` < `n`, `t` is a positive integer and at least 1, `z` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is an integer equal to `(1 + 100001) // 2`, `leftover` is an integer equal to the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is `(1 + 100001) // 2`, `R` is 100001, `adj` is an adjacency list with `n+1` lists where the a-th list contains `b` and the b-th list contains `a` for all pairs of integers `a` and `b` read from stdin, `numCuts` is either greater than `k` or equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `(1 + 100001) // 2`, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `L` has been updated to `(1 + 100001) // 2`, which is the same as the value of `x`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
