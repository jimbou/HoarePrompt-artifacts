Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, t is a positive integer and at least 1, z is 1, i is n-1, x is an integer equal to (1 + 100001) // 2, leftover is an integer equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1), L is 1, R is 100001, numCuts is 0, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where the a-th list contains b and the b-th list contains a for all pairs of integers a and b read from stdin, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, t is a positive integer and at least 1, z is 1, i is n-1, x is an integer equal to (1 + 100001) // 2, leftover is an integer equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1), L is either 1 or (1 + 100001) // 2, R is either 100001 or (1 + 100001) // 2, numCuts is either greater than k or equal to k and leftover is greater than or equal to (1 + 100001) // 2, or less than or equal to k and if the number of cuts is equal to k, then the leftover is less than (1 + 100001) // 2, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where the a-th list contains b and the b-th list contains a for all pairs of integers a and b read from stdin, stdin contains no input.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, t is a positive integer and at least 1, z is 1, i is n-1, x is an integer equal to (L + R) // 2, leftover is an integer equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1), L is either 1 or (1 + 100001) // 2, R is either greater than (1 + 100001) // 2 or 100001, numCuts is 0, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where the a-th list contains b and the b-th list contains a for all pairs of integers a and b read from stdin, stdin contains no input. If numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), then L is updated to (L + R) // 2. Otherwise, R is updated to (L + R) // 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, t is a positive integer and at least 1, z is 1, i is n-1, x is an integer equal to (L + R) // 2, leftover is an integer equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1), if numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), then L is an integer equal to (L + R) // 2, R is either greater than (1 + 100001) // 2 or 100001, and numCuts is 0. Otherwise, L is either 1 or (1 + 100001) // 2 - 2, R is equal to (L + R) // 2, and numCuts is 0.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
