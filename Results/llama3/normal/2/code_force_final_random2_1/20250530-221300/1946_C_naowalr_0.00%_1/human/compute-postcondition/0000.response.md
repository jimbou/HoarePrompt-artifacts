Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` < `n`, and the next `n-1` lines of stdin contain pairs of integers (a, b) where 1 <= a, b <= n, and `t` is assigned the value of the first line of stdin which is an integer.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is updated to be the integer value read from the first line of stdin. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `n-1` lines of pairs of integers (a, b) where 1 <= a, b <= n.
