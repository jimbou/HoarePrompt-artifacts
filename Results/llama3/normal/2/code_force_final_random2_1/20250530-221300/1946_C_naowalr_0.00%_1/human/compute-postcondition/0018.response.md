The variables in the loop head are R and L, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables R and L. If R - L > 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, R - L > 1. However, the current state does not guarantee that R - L > 1, so we need to adjust R and L. Since R - L > 1, we can adjust R and L to R - L >= 2.
State: **`t` is a positive integer and at least 1, `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `k` is a positive integer and `k` < `n`, `z` is 0, `adj` is an adjacency list with `n+1` lists where each list contains `n-1` pairs of integers (a, b), `i` is `n-2`, `x` is an integer between 1 and 100001, `leftover` is an integer, and stdin is empty. If `numCuts` > `k` or (`numCuts` == `k` and `leftover` >= `x`), then `L` is an integer between 1 and 100001, and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, `L` is 1, and `R` is an integer between 1 and 100001, `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k`, and if `numCuts` is equal to `k`, then `leftover` is less than `R`. R - L >= 2**
