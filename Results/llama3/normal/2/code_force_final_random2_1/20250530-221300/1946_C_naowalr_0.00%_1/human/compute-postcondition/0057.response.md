Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, t is a positive integer and at least 1, z is 1, i is n-1, x is an integer equal to (L + R) // 2, leftover is an integer equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1), if numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), then L is an integer equal to (L + R) // 2, R is either greater than (1 + 100001) // 2 or 100001, and numCuts is 0. Otherwise, L is either 1 or (1 + 100001) // 2 - 2, R is equal to (L + R) // 2, and numCuts is 0.***
