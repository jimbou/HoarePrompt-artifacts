To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition `R - L > 1`. The loop will execute if the difference between `R` and `L` is greater than 1.

Given the initial states:
- `n` is a positive integer and at least 2
- `k` is a positive integer and `k < n`
- `t` is a positive integer and at least 1
- `z` is 1
- `i` is `n-1`
- `x` is an integer equal to `(1 + 100001) // 2`
- `leftover` is an integer equal to the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`
- `L` is 1
- `R` is 100001
- `numCuts` is 0
- `adj` is an adjacency list with `n+1` lists where the a-th list contains `b` and the b-th list contains `a` for all pairs of integers `a` and `b` read from stdin
- stdin contains no input

The only variables in the loop head are `R` and `L`. To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to guarantee that `R - L > 1`.

Given that `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001, the condition `R - L > 1` is already satisfied because `100001 - 1 = 100000`, which is indeed greater than 1.

Therefore, no adjustments to the states are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `k` is a positive integer and `k < n`, `t` is a positive integer and at least 1, `z` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is an integer equal to `(1 + 100001) // 2`, `leftover` is an integer equal to the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `adj` is an adjacency list with `n+1` lists where the a-th list contains `b` and the b-th list contains `a` for all pairs of integers `a` and `b` read from stdin, stdin contains no input**
