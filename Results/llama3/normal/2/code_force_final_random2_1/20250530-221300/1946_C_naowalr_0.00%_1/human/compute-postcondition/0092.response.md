Functionality: **The function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the result. It takes no parameters and returns no value. The function reads a positive integer t, then for each test case, it reads a positive integer n and a positive integer k (k < n), and n-1 pairs of integers (a, b) where 1 <= a, b <= n. It constructs an adjacency list from the pairs and performs a binary search to find the minimum value L such that the number of cuts in the graph is greater than k or the number of cuts is equal to k and the leftover value is greater than or equal to L. The function prints the value of L.**
