Output State: **t is a positive integer and at least 1, n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, z is 0, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where each list contains n-1 pairs of integers (a, b), i is n-2, stdin is empty**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the state of the variables is as follows:

*   `t` remains a positive integer and at least 1.
*   `n` remains a positive integer and at least 2.
*   `k` remains a positive integer and less than `n`.
*   `z` remains 0.
*   `adj` becomes an adjacency list with `n+1` lists, where each list contains `n-1` pairs of integers `(a, b)`.
*   `i` becomes `n-2`, indicating that the loop has executed `n-1` times.
*   `stdin` is empty, as all input lines have been read and processed by the loop.
