Output State: **`t` is a positive integer and at least 1, `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `k` is a positive integer and `k` < `n`, `z` is 0, `adj` is an adjacency list with `n+1` lists where each list contains `n-1` pairs of integers (a, b), `i` is `n-2`, `x` is an integer equal to `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is an integer equal to the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is an integer between 1 and 100001, `R` is an integer equal to `(L + R) // 2`, `numCuts` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `R` has been updated to be equal to `x`, which is the average of the original values of `L` and `R`. The other variables remain unchanged.
