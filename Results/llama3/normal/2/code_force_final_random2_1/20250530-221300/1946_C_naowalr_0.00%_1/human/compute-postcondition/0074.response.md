Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `k` is a positive integer and `k` < `n`, `adj` is an adjacency list with `n+1` lists where `adj[a]` contains `b` and `adj[b]` contains `a` for all `n-1` pairs of integers `(a, b)` from the input, `t` is a positive integer and at least 2, `z` is 2, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is an integer equal to `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is an integer equal to the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is `(L + R) // 2`, `R` is 100001, the current value of `numCuts` is greater than `k` or the current value of `numCuts` is equal to `k` and the current value of `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the last line of the input, `b` is an integer equal to the second integer from the last line of the input, and the value of 1 is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `L` has been updated to be equal to `x`, which is the average of the original `L` and `R`. All other variables remain unchanged.
