To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `z` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer and at least 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` < `n`, `z` is 0, and the next `n-1` lines of stdin contain pairs of integers (a, b) where 1 <= a, b <= n**
