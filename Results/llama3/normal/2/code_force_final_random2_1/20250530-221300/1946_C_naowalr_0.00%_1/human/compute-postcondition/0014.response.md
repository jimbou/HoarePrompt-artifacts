Output State: **`t` is a positive integer and at least 1, `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `k` is a positive integer and `k` < `n`, `z` is 0, `adj` is an adjacency list with `n+1` lists where each list contains `n-1` pairs of integers (a, b), `i` is `n-2`, `L` is an integer between 1 and 100001, `R` is 100001, the current value of `numCuts` is greater than `k` or the current value of `numCuts` is equal to `k` and the current value of `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, `x` is an integer between 1 and 100001, `leftover` is an integer, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `L` has been updated to be equal to `x`, which is an integer between 1 and 100001. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
