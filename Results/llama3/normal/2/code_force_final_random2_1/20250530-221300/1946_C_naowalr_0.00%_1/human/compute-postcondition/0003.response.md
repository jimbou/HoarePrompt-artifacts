According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer read from stdin, `t` is a positive integer and at least 1, `k` is a positive integer read from stdin such that `k` < `n`, `z` is 0, `adj` is an empty adjacency list with `n` + 1 empty lists, stdin contains `n`-1 lines of pairs of integers (`a`, `b`) where 1 <= `a`, `b` <= `n`. So for the loop to be executed `n` must be at least 2 and `i` is 0.
State: **`t` is a positive integer and at least 1, `n` is a positive integer read from stdin and at least 2, `k` is a positive integer read from stdin such that `k` < `n`, `z` is 0, `adj` is an empty adjacency list with `n` + 1 empty lists, stdin contains `n`-1 lines of pairs of integers (`a`, `b`) where 1 <= `a`, `b` <= `n`, `i` is 0**
