Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer and at least 1, n is a positive integer read from stdin, k is a positive integer read from stdin such that k < n, z is 0, adj is an empty adjacency list with n + 1 empty lists, stdin contains n-1 lines of pairs of integers (a, b) where 1 <= a, b <= n
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    adj[a].append(b)
    adj[b].append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer and at least 1, n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, z is 0, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where the first two lists contain a pair of integers (a, b) and the rest are empty, i is 0, stdin contains n-2 lines of pairs of integers (a, b) where 1 <= a, b <= n

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer and at least 1, n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, z is 0, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where the first two lists contain a pair of integers (a, b) and the rest are empty except for the last n-2 lists which now contain a pair of integers (a, b), i is 1, stdin is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer and at least 1, n is a positive integer and at least 3, k is a positive integer and k < n, z is 0, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where the first two lists contain two pairs of integers (a, b) and the rest are empty except for the last n-2 lists which now contain two pairs of integers (a, b), i is 2, stdin is empty




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
