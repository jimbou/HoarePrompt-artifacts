Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer and at least 1, `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `k` is a positive integer and `k` < `n`, `z` is 0, `adj` is an adjacency list with `n+1` lists where each list contains `n-1` pairs of integers (a, b), `i` is `n-2`, `x` is an integer between 1 and 100001, `leftover` is an integer, `L` and `R` are integers between 1 and 100001, `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and is equal to the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`. If `numCuts` > `k` or (`numCuts` == `k` and `leftover` >= `x`), then `L` is equal to `x` which is equal to `(L + R) // 2`. Otherwise, `R` is equal to `x` which is equal to `(L + R) // 2`.**
