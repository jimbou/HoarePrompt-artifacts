Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `k` is a positive integer and `k` < `n`, `adj` is an adjacency list with `n+1` lists where `adj[a]` contains `b` and `adj[b]` contains `a` for all `n-1` pairs of integers `(a, b)` from the input, `t` is a positive integer and at least 2, `z` is 2, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is an integer equal to `(L + R) // 2`, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the last line of the input, `b` is an integer equal to the second integer from the last line of the input, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is an integer equal to the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is `(L + R) // 2`, and the value of 1 is being printed. If `numCuts` > `k` or (`numCuts` == `k` and `leftover` >= `x`), then `R` is 100001. Otherwise, `R` is `(L + R) // 2`. `R` must be at least 3 if `L` is 1, or `L + 2` if `L` is `(L + R) // 2`.**

In this output state, the value of `L` has been updated to `(L + R) // 2`, which is the same as the value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for updating `R` are still dependent on the values of `numCuts`, `k`, and `leftover`.
