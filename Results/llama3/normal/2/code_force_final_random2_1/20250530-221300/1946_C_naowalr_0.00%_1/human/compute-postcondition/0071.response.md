The only variables in the loop head are variables R and L, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables R and L. If R - L is greater than 1, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, L is 1 and R is 100001, so R - L is indeed greater than 1. Therefore, no adjustments are needed.

State: **n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where adj[a] contains b and adj[b] contains a for all n-1 pairs of integers (a, b) from the input, t is a positive integer and at least 2, z is 2, i is n-1, x is an integer equal to 1, leftover is an integer equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1), L is 1, R is 100001, numCuts is 0, stdin contains no input, and the value of 1 is being printed, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the last line of the input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the last line of the input**
