The only variable in the loop head is variable z, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable z and t. If z is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, z is 1, t is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, z must be increased by 1, so z is 2 and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 1.
State: **n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, t is a positive integer and at least 2, z is 2, i is n-1, x is an integer equal to L, leftover is an integer equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1), L is an integer and R is an integer and R - L is 1, numCuts is 0, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where the a-th list contains b and the b-th list contains a for all pairs of integers a and b read from stdin, stdin contains no input, and the value of L is being printed**
