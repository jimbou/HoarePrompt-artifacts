Output: **n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where adj[a] contains b and adj[b] contains a for all n-1 pairs of integers (a, b) from the input, t is a positive integer and at least 2, z is 2, i is n-1, x is an integer equal to (L + R) // 2, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the last line of the input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the last line of the input, numCuts is 0, leftover is an integer equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1), and the value of 1 is being printed. L and R are equal, and L is being printed which is equal to R**
