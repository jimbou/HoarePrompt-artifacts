The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `k` is a positive integer and `k` < `n`, `t` is a positive integer and at least 1, `z` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer equal to (`L` + `R`) // 2, `leftover` is an integer equal to the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` and `R` are integers between 1 and 100001 and `L` = `R`, `numCuts` is 0, `adj` is an adjacency list with `n+1` lists where the a-th list contains b and the b-th list contains a, `stdin` contains no input.**
