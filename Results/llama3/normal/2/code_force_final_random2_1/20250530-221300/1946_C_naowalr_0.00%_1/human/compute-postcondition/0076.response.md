Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `k` is a positive integer and `k` < `n`, `adj` is an adjacency list with `n+1` lists where `adj[a]` contains `b` and `adj[b]` contains `a` for all `n-1` pairs of integers `(a, b)` from the input, `t` is a positive integer and at least 2, `z` is 2, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is an integer equal to `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is an integer equal to the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is 1, `R` is `(L + R) // 2`, `numCuts` is 0, stdin contains no input, and the value of 1 is being printed, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the last line of the input, `b` is an integer equal to the second integer from the last line of the input. Additionally, either `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and `leftover` is less than `(L + R) // 2`, or `numCuts` is less than `k`.**

In this output state, the value of `R` has been updated to be equal to `x`, which is the average of the original `L` and `R` values. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding `numCuts`, `k`, and `leftover` are still valid, but the comparison involving `x` has been updated to use the new value of `R`.
