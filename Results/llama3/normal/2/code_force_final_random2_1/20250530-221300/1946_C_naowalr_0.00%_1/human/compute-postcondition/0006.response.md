Output State: **t is a positive integer and at least 1, n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, z is 0, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where the first two lists contain a pair of integers (a, b) and the rest are empty except for the last n-2 lists which now contain a pair of integers (a, b), i is 1, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `z` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The `adj` list is updated by adding pairs of integers to the last `n-2` lists, which were initially empty. The `i` variable remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The `stdin` is now empty as all the input lines have been read and processed.
