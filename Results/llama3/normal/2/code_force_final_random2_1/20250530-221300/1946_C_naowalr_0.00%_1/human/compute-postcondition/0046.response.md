Output State: **n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, t is a positive integer and at least 1, z is 1, i is n-1, x is an integer equal to (1 + 100001) // 2, leftover is an integer equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1), L is 1, R is (1 + 100001) // 2, numCuts is 0, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where the a-th list contains b and the b-th list contains a for all pairs of integers a and b read from stdin, stdin contains no input. Additionally, the number of cuts is less than or equal to k and if the number of cuts is equal to k, then the leftover is less than (1 + 100001) // 2.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of R has been updated to be equal to x, which is (1 + 100001) // 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
