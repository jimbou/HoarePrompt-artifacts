Output State: **t is a positive integer and at least 1, n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, z is 0, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where each list contains n-1 pairs of integers (a, b), i is n-2, x is an integer between 1 and 100001, leftover is an integer, L is an integer between 1 and 100001, R is an integer equal to (L + R) // 2, and numCuts is less than or equal to k and is equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1).**

In natural language, the output state is: All variables retain their initial values except for R, which is now equal to x, which is the average of L and R.
