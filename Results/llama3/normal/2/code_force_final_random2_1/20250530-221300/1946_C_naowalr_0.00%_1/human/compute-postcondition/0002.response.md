The code snippet provided reads two integers from the standard input, `n` and `k`, and creates an empty adjacency list `adj` with `n + 1` empty lists.

Here's the combined effect of all lines on the program:

*   The first line reads two integers from the standard input, `n` and `k`, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`, respectively. This line modifies the values of `n` and `k`.
*   The second line creates an empty adjacency list `adj` with `n + 1` empty lists. This line introduces a new variable `adj` and assigns it a list of empty lists.

Considering the initial state and the effects of the code, the final output state is:

Output State: **t is a positive integer and at least 1, n is a positive integer read from stdin, k is a positive integer read from stdin such that k < n, z is 0, adj is an empty adjacency list with n + 1 empty lists, stdin contains n-1 lines of pairs of integers (a, b) where 1 <= a, b <= n**
