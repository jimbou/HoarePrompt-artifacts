Output State: **n is a positive integer and at least 2, k is a positive integer and k < n, adj is an adjacency list with n+1 lists where adj[a] contains b and adj[b] contains a for all n-1 pairs of integers (a, b) from the input, t is a positive integer and at least 2, z is 2, i is n-1, x is an integer equal to (L + R) // 2, leftover is an integer equal to the value returned by dfs(1, 1), L is 1, R is 100001, numCuts is 0, stdin contains no input, and the value of 1 is being printed, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the last line of the input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the last line of the input.**

The code block modifies the values of `x`, `numCuts`, and `leftover`. The first line calculates the average of `L` and `R` and assigns it to `x`. The second line resets `numCuts` to 0. The third line calls the `dfs` function with arguments 1 and 1, and assigns the returned value to `leftover`. The remaining variables retain their initial values.
