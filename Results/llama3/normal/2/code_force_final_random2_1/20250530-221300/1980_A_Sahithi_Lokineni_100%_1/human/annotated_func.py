#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) followed by a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G'.
    return 0
    #The program returns 0

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from stdin, processes it, and then returns 0, indicating successful execution. It does not modify the input or produce any output.
