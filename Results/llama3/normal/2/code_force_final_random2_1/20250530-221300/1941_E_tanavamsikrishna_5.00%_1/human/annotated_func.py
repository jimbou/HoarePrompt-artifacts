        row[i] = row[i] + 1
        
    #State: `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first `d - 1` elements are each incremented by 1, `d` is a positive integer such that `d <= len(row)`, `i` is `d - 1`.

        row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
        
    #State: `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first `d - 1` elements are each incremented by 1, and the value of `row[i]` is updated to be at least `1` more than the original value, `d` is a positive integer such that `d` is less than `len(row)`, `i` is equal to `len(row)`, and `row[i]` is now equal to `(min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1` for all `i` in the range `[d - 1, len(row))`.
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the list 'row', which is a non-negative integer that has been updated to be at least 1 more than its original value, and is also equal to the sum of the minimum value of the previous 'd + 1' elements in the list 'row' (or 0 if 'i' is 0) and the original value of 'row[i]' plus 1, where 'i' is equal to the length of the list 'row' and 'd' is a positive integer less than the length of the list 'row'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function accepts a list of non-negative integers and a positive integer d as input, where d is less than or equal to the length of the list. It increments the first d-1 elements of the list by 1, and then updates the remaining elements to be at least 1 more than their original value, based on the minimum value of the previous d+1 elements. The function returns the last element of the updated list, which is a non-negative integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, k, and d are positive integers, n is the number of rows, m is the number of columns, k is the number of bridges, and d is the maximum distance between supports. rows is a 2D list of non-negative integers, where each inner list represents a row in the river grid and each integer represents the depth of a cell. costs is a list of non-negative integers, where each integer represents the cost of installing supports for a row. total_costs is a list of non-negative integers, where each integer represents the total cost of installing supports for k consecutive rows.
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]

    #State: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, `rows` is a 2D list of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least `len(costs) - (k - 1)` elements, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of all possible sublists of `k` consecutive elements in `costs`, `i` is `len(costs) - (k - 1) - 1`
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: minimum sum of k consecutive elements in the costs list

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates and prints the minimum sum of k consecutive elements in the costs list, which represents the total cost of installing supports for k consecutive rows in a river grid, given the number of rows, columns, bridges, maximum distance between supports, and the depth of each cell in the grid.
