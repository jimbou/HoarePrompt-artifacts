Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges on consecutive rows of the river.

The `func_1` function correctly calculates the minimum cost for a single row by iterating through the row and updating the costs based on the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells. The `func_2` function correctly reads the input, calculates the costs for each row, and finds the minimum total cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows.

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when `k` is 1 or when the input rows have a length of 1.

Therefore, based on my analysis, the program is correct, and the answer is **True**.
