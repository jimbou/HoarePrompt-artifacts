To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `costs`. The loop will execute if the length of `costs` is at least `k`. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, `rows` is a 2D list of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of non-negative integers, and `total_costs` is an empty list. For the loop to execute, `costs` must have at least `k` elements, and `i` is 0.

State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, `rows` is a 2D list of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least `k` elements, `total_costs` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
