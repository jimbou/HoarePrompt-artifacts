Let's break down the code and its impact on the program.

The code `total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))` appends the sum of the elements in the `costs` list from index `i` to `i + k` to the `total_costs` list.

Since `i` is 1, the sum of the elements in the `costs` list from index 1 to `k + 1` is appended to `total_costs`.

The value of `k` is a positive integer, so the sum of the elements in the `costs` list from index 1 to `k + 1` is also a non-negative integer.

The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `d`, `rows`, and `costs`) are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, `rows` is a 2D list of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least `k` elements, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs` and the sum of the elements in the `costs` list from index 1 to `k + 1`, `i` is 1**
