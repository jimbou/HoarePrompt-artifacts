The code `total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))` appends the sum of the elements in the `costs` list from index `i` to `i + k` to the `total_costs` list. The value of `i` is 2, and `k` is a positive integer.

The sum of the elements in the `costs` list from index 2 to `2 + k` is appended to the `total_costs` list. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, `rows` is a 2D list of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least `k+1` elements, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k+1` elements of `costs`, the sum of the elements in the `costs` list from index 2 to `k + 2`, and the sum of the elements in the `costs` list from index 2 to `2 + k`, `i` is 2**
