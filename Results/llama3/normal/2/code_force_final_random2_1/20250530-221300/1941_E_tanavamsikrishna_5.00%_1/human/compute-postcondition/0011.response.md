The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `d`. If `i` is less than `len(row)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than or equal to `d` and less than `len(row)`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1. So, `i` is now greater than or equal to `d` and less than `len(row)`, and `i` is now equal to the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration plus 1.
State: **`row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first `d - 1` elements are each incremented by 1, and the value of `row[i]` is updated to be at least `1` more than the original value, `d` is a positive integer such that `d` is less than `len(row)`, `i` is greater than or equal to `d` and less than `len(row)`, and `row[i]` is now equal to the minimum value of the `d + 1` elements preceding it plus the original value of `row[i]` plus 1, and `i` is now equal to the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration plus 1**
