Output State: **n, m, k, and d are positive integers, n is the number of rows, m is the number of columns, k is the number of bridges, and d is the maximum distance between supports. rows is a 2D list of non-negative integers, where each inner list represents a row in the river grid and each integer represents the depth of a cell. costs is a list of non-negative integers, where each integer represents the cost of installing supports for a row. total_costs is an empty list. stdin contains n-1 inputs: a space-separated list of integers for each row in the river grid.**

In this output state, the values of n, m, k, and d are updated based on the input provided. The rows variable is populated with a 2D list of non-negative integers, representing the depth of each cell in the river grid. The costs variable is calculated by applying the func_1 function to each row in the rows list, with the maximum distance d as an argument. The total_costs list remains empty, as no operations are performed on it. The stdin input is reduced by n inputs, as each row in the river grid is read from the input.
