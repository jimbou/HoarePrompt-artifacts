Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of minimizing the total cost of installing supports for k consecutive rows in a river grid. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

Func_1 takes a list of non-negative integers and a positive integer d as input, where d is less than or equal to the length of the list. It increments the first d-1 elements of the list by 1, and then updates the remaining elements to be at least 1 more than their original value, based on the minimum value of the previous d+1 elements. The function returns the last element of the updated list, which is a non-negative integer.

Func_2 calculates the minimum sum of k consecutive elements in the costs list, which represents the total cost of installing supports for k consecutive rows in a river grid. It takes the number of rows, columns, bridges, maximum distance between supports, and the depth of each cell in the grid as input.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It first calculates the cost of installing supports for each row using func_1, and then calculates the minimum sum of k consecutive elements in the costs list using func_2. The program prints the minimum sum, which is the minimum total cost of installing supports for k consecutive rows.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
