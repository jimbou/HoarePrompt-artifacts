To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):`

The objects involved in the loop head are `i`, `costs`, and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 1.

The state of `costs` and `k` remains the same, as they are not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, `rows` is a 2D list of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least `k` elements, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`, `i` is 1**
