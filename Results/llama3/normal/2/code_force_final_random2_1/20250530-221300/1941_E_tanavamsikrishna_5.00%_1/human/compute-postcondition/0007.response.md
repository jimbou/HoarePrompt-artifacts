Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, `rows` is a 2D list of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least `len(costs) - (k - 1)` elements, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of all possible sublists of `k` consecutive elements in `costs`, `i` is `len(costs) - (k - 1) - 1`**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

The loop will iterate over the `costs` list, calculating the sum of all possible sublists of `k` consecutive elements. The `total_costs` list will contain these sums. The loop will continue until it has processed all possible sublists of `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list. The final value of `i` will be the last index processed by the loop. The other variables, `n`, `m`, `d`, and `rows`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
