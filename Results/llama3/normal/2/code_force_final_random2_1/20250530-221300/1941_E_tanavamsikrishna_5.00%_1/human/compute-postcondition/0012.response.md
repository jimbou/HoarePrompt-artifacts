Output State: **`row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first `d - 1` elements are each incremented by 1, and the value of `row[i]` is updated to be at least `1` more than the original value, `d` is a positive integer such that `d` is less than `len(row)`, `i` is greater than or equal to `d` and less than `len(row)`, and `row[i]` is now equal to the minimum value of the `d + 1` elements preceding it plus the original value of `row[i]` plus 1, and `i` is now equal to the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration plus 1, and `row[i]` is now equal to `(min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1`**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `row` has been updated such that the value at index `i` is now the minimum value of the `d + 1` elements preceding it, plus the original value at index `i`, plus 1. The value of `i` has also been incremented by 1. The other variables, `d` and the rest of the elements in `row`, remain unchanged.
