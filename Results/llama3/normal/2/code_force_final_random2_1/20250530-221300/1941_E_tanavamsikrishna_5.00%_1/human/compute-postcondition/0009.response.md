Output: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, `rows` is a 2D list of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least `len(costs) - (k - 1)` elements, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of all possible sublists of `k` consecutive elements in `costs`, `i` is `len(costs) - (k - 1) - 1`, and the minimum value in `total_costs` is printed**
