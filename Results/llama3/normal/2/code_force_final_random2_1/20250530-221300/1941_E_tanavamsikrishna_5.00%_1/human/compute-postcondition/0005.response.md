To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):`

The objects in the loop head are `i`, `costs`, and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `costs` has at least `k` elements.

To adjust the states for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The length of `costs` and the value of `k` remain the same.

The state of `total_costs` is not directly related to the loop head, so we don't need to adjust it. However, we can infer that `total_costs` will contain the sum of the first `k+1` elements of `costs` and the sum of the elements in the `costs` list from index 2 to `k + 2`.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, `rows` is a 2D list of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least `k+1` elements, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k+1` elements of `costs` and the sum of the elements in the `costs` list from index 2 to `k + 2`, `i` is 2**
