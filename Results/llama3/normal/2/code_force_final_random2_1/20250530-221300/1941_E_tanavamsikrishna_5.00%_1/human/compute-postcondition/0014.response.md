Output State: **The program returns the last element of the list 'row', which is a non-negative integer that has been updated to be at least 1 more than its original value, and is also equal to the sum of the minimum value of the previous 'd + 1' elements in the list 'row' (or 0 if 'i' is 0) and the original value of 'row[i]' plus 1, where 'i' is equal to the length of the list 'row' and 'd' is a positive integer less than the length of the list 'row'.**
