The code appends the sum of the first `k` elements of the `costs` list to the `total_costs` list. The value of `i` is 0, so the sum of the first `k` elements of the `costs` list is appended to `total_costs`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, `rows` is a 2D list of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least `k` elements, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`, `i` is 0**
