Output State: **`row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first `d - 1` elements are each incremented by 1, and the value of `row[i]` is updated to be at least `1` more than the original value, `d` is a positive integer such that `d` is less than `len(row)`, `i` is equal to `len(row)`, and `row[i]` is now equal to `(min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1` for all `i` in the range `[d - 1, len(row))`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the first `d - 1` elements of the list `row` are each incremented by 1, and the value of `row[i]` is updated to be at least 1 more than the original value for all `i` in the range `[d - 1, len(row))`. The value of `d` remains a positive integer less than the length of `row`, and the value of `i` is equal to the length of `row`. The value of `row[i]` is now equal to the minimum value of the `d + 1` elements preceding it plus the original value of `row[i]` plus 1 for all `i` in the range `[d - 1, len(row))`.
