Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost of installing supports for k consecutive rows in a river grid, where the cost of installing a support in a cell is the depth of the cell plus 1, and the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d.

The program uses two functions: func_1 and func_2. func_1 takes a row and the maximum distance d as input and returns the minimum cost of installing supports for that row. It does this by iterating over the row and updating the cost of each cell to be at least 1 more than the original value, and also equal to the sum of the minimum value of the previous d + 1 elements in the row (or 0 if the current index is 0) and the original value of the cell plus 1.

func_2 takes the number of rows, columns, bridges, and the maximum distance as input, reads the river grid from the input, calculates the cost of installing supports for each row using func_1, and then calculates the total cost of installing supports for k consecutive rows by summing up the costs of the rows. It then prints the minimum total cost.

The program correctly implements the problem's requirements and constraints. It correctly calculates the cost of installing supports for each row and the total cost for k consecutive rows. It also correctly handles the boundary conditions, such as when the current index is 0 or when the distance between supports is 1.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
