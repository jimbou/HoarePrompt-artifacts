Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost of installing supports for k consecutive rows in a river grid, given the number of rows, columns, bridges, maximum distance between supports, and the depth of each cell in the grid.

Function 1 (`func_1`) calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row, given the depth of each cell in the row and the maximum distance between supports. It correctly increments the first d-1 elements of the row by 1 and then updates the remaining elements to be at least 1 more than their original value, based on the minimum value of the previous d+1 elements.

Function 2 (`func_2`) calculates the minimum total cost of installing supports for k consecutive rows. It correctly reads the input, calculates the cost of installing supports for each row using `func_1`, and then finds the minimum sum of k consecutive elements in the costs list.

The program correctly implements the problem's requirements and uses the functions correctly to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
