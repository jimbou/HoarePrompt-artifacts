The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and `times`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `times`. If `times` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `times` is an integer, `check` is 2147483647, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. So for the loop to be executed, `times` must be greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **`times` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `check` is 2147483647, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `_` is 0**
