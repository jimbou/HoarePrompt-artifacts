Output State: **times is an integer, check is 2147483647, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains one input: a list of integers (the integers in the test case). The integers are non-negative and less than 2^31.**

The first line of the code assigns the integer value of the first input in the first test case to `times`. Since the input is an integer, `times` becomes an integer. The second line assigns the value of `2 ** 31 - 1` to `check`. Since `2 ** 31 - 1` equals 2147483647, `check` becomes 2147483647. 

The first line of the code also consumes the first input in the first test case, so stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case still contains one input: a list of integers (the integers in the test case). The integers are still non-negative and less than 2^31.
