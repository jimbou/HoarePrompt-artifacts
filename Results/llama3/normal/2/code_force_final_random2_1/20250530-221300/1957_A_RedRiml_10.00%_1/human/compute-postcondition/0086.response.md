Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka`, `_` is 2, `shapes` is the total count of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`, `stdin` contains `w - 4` test cases, `j` is the last element in the list, and `shapes` is being printed, `i` is the first element in `palka` and is in the list `pl`, If `d` does not contain `i` as a key, `d` is updated to contain `i` as a key with a value of 1. Otherwise, the value of `i` in `d` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `w` is still between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is still an integer, `palka` is still a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is now a list containing the first element of `palka`, the value of `_` is still 2, `shapes` is still the total count of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`, `stdin` still contains `w - 4` test cases, `j` is still the last element in the list, and `shapes` is still being printed. The first element of `palka` is now in the list `pl`. The dictionary `d` has been updated to contain the first element of `palka` as a key with a value of 1, or the value of the first element of `palka` in `d` has been incremented by 1.
