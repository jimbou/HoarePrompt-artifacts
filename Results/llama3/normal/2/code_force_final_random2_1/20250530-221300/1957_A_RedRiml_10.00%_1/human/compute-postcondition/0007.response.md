Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary that contains the first element of `palka` as a key with its value incremented by 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains w - 1 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `d[i]` has been incremented by 1, where `i` is the first element of the list `palka`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `w - 1` test cases.
