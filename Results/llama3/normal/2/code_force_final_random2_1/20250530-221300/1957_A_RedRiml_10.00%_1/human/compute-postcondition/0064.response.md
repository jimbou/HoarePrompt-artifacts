The only variable in the loop head is `j` and `pl`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `pl`. If `pl` has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that element, `_` is 1, `shapes` is 0, `stdin` contains `w - 3` test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the list `pl` must have at least 1 element and `j` is the first element in the list.
State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list containing at least 1 unique element from the original `palka` list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that element, `_` is 1, `shapes` is 0, `stdin` contains `w - 3` test cases, `j` is the first element in the list**
