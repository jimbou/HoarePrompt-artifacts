Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `w - 3` test cases, `i` is the third element in the list `palka`, `d` is a dictionary containing the key `i` with a value of 1, and `pl` is a list containing the first two elements of `palka` and `i` if `i` is not in `pl`, otherwise `pl` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `w` is still between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is still an integer, `palka` is still a list of integers with at least 3 elements, and `_` is still 1. The stdin still contains `w - 3` test cases. The value of `i` is still the third element in the list `palka`. The dictionary `d` now contains the key `i` with a value of 1. The list `pl` now contains the first two elements of `palka` and `i` if `i` was not already in `pl`, otherwise `pl` remains unchanged.
