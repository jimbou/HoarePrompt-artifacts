Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary where the value of the key `i` (which is the first element in the list `palka`) is increased by 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `w - 3` test cases, and `i` is the first element in the list `palka`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of the key `i` in the dictionary `d` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
