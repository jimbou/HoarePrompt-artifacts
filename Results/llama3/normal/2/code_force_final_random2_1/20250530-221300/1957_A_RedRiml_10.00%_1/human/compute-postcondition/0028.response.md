Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from the original list `palka` that must have at least 1 element, `d` is a dictionary with keys being all elements from the original list `palka` and values being the frequency of each element, `_` is 0, `shapes` is 1, stdin contains `w - 1` test cases, `j` is the first element in the list. The current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.**

The code increments the value of `shapes` by 1. The initial value of `shapes` was 0, so now it becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `w - 1` test cases. The value of `d[j]` is still greater than or equal to 3.
