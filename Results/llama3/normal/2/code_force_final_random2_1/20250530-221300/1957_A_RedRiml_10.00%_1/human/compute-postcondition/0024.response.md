Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from the original list `palka`, `d` is a dictionary with keys being all elements from the original list `palka` and values being the frequency of each element, `_` is 0, stdin contains `w - 1` test cases.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `w`, `ln`, and `_` as in the initial state. The list `palka` will be empty since the loop iterates over all its elements. The list `pl` will contain all unique elements from the original list `palka`. The dictionary `d` will have keys being all elements from the original list `palka` and values being the frequency of each element. The stdin will still contain `w - 1` test cases.
