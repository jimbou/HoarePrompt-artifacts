Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from the original `palka` list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that element, `_` is 1, `shapes` is 0, `stdin` contains `w - 3` test cases.**

The code introduces a new variable `shapes` and assigns it the value 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `w - 3` test cases.
