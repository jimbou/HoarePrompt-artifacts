Postcondition: ***`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with key `i` (the first element in the list `palka`) and value either 1 (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or its previous value incremented by 1 (if `i` was already in `d`), `_` is 0, stdin contains `w - 1` test cases, and `i` is the first element in the list `palka`.***
