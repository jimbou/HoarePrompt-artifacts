To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head `for i in palka:` and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head indicates that the loop iterates over the elements of the list `palka`. For the loop to execute again, we need to adjust the state of `i` and `palka`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the second element in the list `palka`. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be the next element in the list `palka`. Since `palka` must have at least 2 elements, we can assume that it has at least 3 elements for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka` and the second element of `palka` if the first element of `palka` was not previously in `pl` and the second element of `palka` was not in `pl`, otherwise `pl` remains unchanged, `d` is a dictionary with key `i` (the first element in the list `palka`) and value either 1 (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or its previous value incremented by 1 (if `i` was already in `d`), `_` is 0, stdin contains `w - 1` test cases, and `i` is the third element in the list `palka`.**
