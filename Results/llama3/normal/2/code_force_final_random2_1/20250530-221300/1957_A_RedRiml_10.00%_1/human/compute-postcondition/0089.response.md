Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka`, `_` is 2, `shapes` is the total count of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`, `stdin` contains `w - 4` test cases, `j` is the last element in the list, `shapes` is being printed, `i` is the second element in `palka`, `d[i]` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `d[i]` has been updated to 1, where `i` is the second element in the list `palka`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on their values are still valid. The stdin still contains `w - 4` test cases, and `shapes` is still being printed.
