Postcondition: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is an empty list, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `w - 3` test cases, and `i` is the first element in the list `palka`. The dictionary `d` contains the key `i` with a value that is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or the previous value of `i` in `d` incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `d`. The current value of `i` is not in the list `pl`.**
