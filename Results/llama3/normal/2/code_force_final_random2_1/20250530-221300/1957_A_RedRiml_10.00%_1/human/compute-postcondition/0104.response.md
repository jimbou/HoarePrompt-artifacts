Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least `len(palka)` elements, `pl` is a list containing all elements of `palka` with no duplicates and must have at least 1 element, `_` is 2, `shapes` is 1, `stdin` contains `w - 4` test cases, `j` is the first element in the list, and `i` is the last element in `palka`. The current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3**

The code increments the value of `shapes` by 1. The initial value of `shapes` was 0, so after the increment, its value becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least `len(palka)` elements, `pl` is a list containing all elements of `palka` with no duplicates and must have at least 1 element, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `w - 4` test cases, `j` is the first element in the list, and `i` is the last element in `palka`, and the current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, still holds true.
