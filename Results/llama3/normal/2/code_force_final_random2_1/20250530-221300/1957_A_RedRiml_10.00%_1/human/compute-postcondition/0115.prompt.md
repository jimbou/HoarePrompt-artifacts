Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `w` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains `w` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 100).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(w):
    ln = int(input())
    palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pl = []
    d = {}
    for i in palka:
        if d.get(i) == None:
            d[i] = 1
        else:
            d[i] += 1
        if i not in pl:
            pl.append(i)
    shapes = 0
    for j in pl:
        if d[j] >= 3:
            shapes += 1
    print(shapes)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with keys being all elements from the original list `palka` and values being the frequency of each element, `_` is 0, stdin contains `w - 1` test cases, and the number of elements in `pl` that have a frequency of 3 or more in `d` which is `shapes` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from the original `palka` list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that element, `_` is 1, `shapes` is the total count of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`, `stdin` contains `w - 3` test cases, `j` is the last element in the list, and the total count of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d` which is `shapes` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least `len(palka)` elements, `pl` is a list containing all elements of `palka` with no duplicates and must have at least `len(pl)` elements, `_` is 2, `j` is the last element in the list, and `i` is the last element in `palka`. `stdin` contains `w - 4` test cases. `shapes` is equal to the number of elements in `pl` for which `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, and the number of shapes is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
