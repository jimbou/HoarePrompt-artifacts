Output State: **w is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, ln is an integer, palka is a list of integers, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary, _ is 2, shapes is the total count of elements in pl that have a count of 3 or more in d, stdin contains w - 4 test cases, j is the last element in the list, and the total count of elements in pl that have a count of 3 or more in d which is shapes is being printed.**

The code snippet reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `ln`, then reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `palka`. The list `pl` and dictionary `d` are reset to empty. The value of `w` is not modified, so it remains an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1. The value of `_` is also not modified, so it remains 2. The value of `shapes` is not modified, but its value is being printed. The value of `j` is not modified, so it remains the last element in the list. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 2, so it now contains `w - 4` test cases.
