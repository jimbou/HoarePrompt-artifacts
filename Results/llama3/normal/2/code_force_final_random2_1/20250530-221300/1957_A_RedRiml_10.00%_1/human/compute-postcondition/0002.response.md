Output State: **w is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 0, ln is an integer, palka is a list of integers, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary, _ is 0, stdin contains w - 1 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `w` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The variable `ln` is assigned an integer value from the input, and `palka` is assigned a list of integers from the input. The variable `pl` is initialized as an empty list, and `d` is initialized as an empty dictionary. The variable `_` remains unchanged with a value of 0. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1 as two inputs are consumed by the code.
