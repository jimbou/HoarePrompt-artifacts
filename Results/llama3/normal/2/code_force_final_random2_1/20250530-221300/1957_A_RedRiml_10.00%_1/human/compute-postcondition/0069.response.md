Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list containing at least 2 unique elements from the original `palka` list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that element, `_` is 1, `shapes` is 1, `stdin` contains `w - 3` test cases, `j` is the second element in the list. If the current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, then this condition is still valid, otherwise this condition is not valid anymore.**

In this output state, the value of `shapes` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition related to `d[j]` is still valid if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise it is not valid anymore.
