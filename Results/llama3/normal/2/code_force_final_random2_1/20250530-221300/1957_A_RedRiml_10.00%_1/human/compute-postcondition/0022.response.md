Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka`, the second element of `palka` if the first element of `palka` was not previously in `pl` and the second element of `palka` was not in `pl`, and the third element of `palka`, `d` is a dictionary with key `i` (the first element in the list `palka`) and value either 1 (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or its previous value incremented by 1 (if `i` was already in `d`), `_` is 0, stdin contains `w - 1` test cases.**

In this output state, the list `pl` has been updated to include the third element of `palka`, in addition to its previous elements. The other variables remain unchanged.
