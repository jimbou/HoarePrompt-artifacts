Postcondition: ***`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least `len(palka)` elements, `pl` is a list containing all elements of `palka` with no duplicates and must have at least 1 element, `_` is 2, `j` is the first element in the list, and `i` is the last element in `palka`. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is 1. Otherwise, `shapes` remains 0. `stdin` contains `w - 4` test cases.***
