Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least `len(palka)` elements, `pl` is a list containing all elements of `palka` with no duplicates, `_` is 2, `shapes` is 0, `stdin` contains `w - 4` test cases, `j` is the last element in the list, and `i` is the last element in `palka`.**

In this output state, the value of `shapes` has been reset to 0. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties. The stdin still contains `w - 4` test cases, and the lists `palka` and `pl` retain their elements and characteristics. The last elements in the lists, `j` and `i`, also remain the same.
