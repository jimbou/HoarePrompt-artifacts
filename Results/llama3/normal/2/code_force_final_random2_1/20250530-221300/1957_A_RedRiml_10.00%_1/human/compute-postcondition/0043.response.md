Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary containing the key `i` with value 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `w - 3` test cases, and `i` is the first element in the list `palka`.**

In this output state, the value of `d` has been updated to include the key `i` with value 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `d` now contains the key `i`, which is the first element of the list `palka`, with a value of 1. The rest of the variables maintain their initial values and properties.
