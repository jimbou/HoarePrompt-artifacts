Postcondition: ***`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka`, `_` is 2, `shapes` is the total count of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`, `stdin` contains `w - 4` test cases, `j` is the last element in the list, and `shapes` is being printed, `i` is the first element in `palka`. If `i` is not in `pl`, `i` is added to `pl` and if `d` does not contain `i` as a key, `d` is updated to contain `i` as a key with a value of 1. Otherwise, the value of `i` in `d` is incremented by 1.***
