Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `w - 3` test cases, `i` is the second element in the list `palka`, `pl` is a list containing the first two elements of `palka`, and `d` is a dictionary containing the key `i` with a value of 1.**

In this output state, the value of `d[i]` has been updated to 1, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `pl` is still a list containing the first two elements of `palka`, as the code does not modify `pl`.
