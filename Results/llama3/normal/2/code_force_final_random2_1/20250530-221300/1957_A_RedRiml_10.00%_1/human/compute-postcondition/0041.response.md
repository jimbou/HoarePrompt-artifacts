To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `palka`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `palka`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Since `w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, and `stdin` contains `w - 3` test cases, we can infer that `w` is at least 4.

To guarantee the loop's execution, we need to adjust the state of `palka` to have at least 1 element. We can also adjust the state of `i` to be the first element in the list `palka`.

State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `w - 3` test cases, `i` is the first element in the list `palka`**
