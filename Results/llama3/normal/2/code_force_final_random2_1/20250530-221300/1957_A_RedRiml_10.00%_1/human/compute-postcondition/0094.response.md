To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `palka`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `palka` list. If `palka` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `palka` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `palka`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `palka` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` must be the third element in `palka`.

State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka`, the second element of `palka`, and the third element of `palka` if `i` is not in `pl`, otherwise `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka` and the third element of `palka`, `_` is 2, `shapes` is the total count of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`, `stdin` contains `w - 4` test cases, `j` is the last element in the list, `shapes` is being printed, `i` is the third element in `palka`. If `d.get(i)` is `None`, then `d[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by 1.**
