Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with key `i` (the first element in the list `palka`) and value 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains `w - 1` test cases, and `i` is the first element in the list `palka`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `w` remains unchanged, `ln` is still an integer, `palka` is still a list of integers with at least one element, `pl` is still an empty list, and `_` is still 0. The dictionary `d` now has a new key-value pair where the key is the first element `i` in the list `palka` and the value is 1. The stdin still contains `w - 1` test cases, and `i` is still the first element in the list `palka`.
