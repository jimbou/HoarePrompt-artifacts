The code prints the value of `shapes`, which is the total count of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`. Since `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from the original `palka` list and `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that element, `shapes` represents the number of elements in `palka` that appear three or more times.

Output: **the total count of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`**
