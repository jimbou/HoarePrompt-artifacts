To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head `for i in palka:` and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

1. **`palka`**: Since `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, and we are iterating over it, for the loop to execute again, `palka` must have at least one more element after the first one (since `i` is the first element in the list `palka` at the end of the previous iteration). Therefore, `palka` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to continue.

2. **`i`**: Given that `i` is the first element in the list `palka` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be the next element in `palka`. Since we do not know the exact elements in `palka` except that it has at least one element and `i` is the first, we can say `i` will be the second element in `palka` for the loop to continue.

3. **`pl`**: The state of `pl` depends on whether the first element of `palka` was previously in `pl`. However, since we are considering the next iteration and the state of `pl` is determined by the first element of `palka` which is now `i`, and we do not have information about the second element of `palka` being in `pl` or not, we cannot adjust `pl` based on the given information. Its state remains dependent on the conditions that will be evaluated in the next iteration.

4. **`d`**: The dictionary `d` has a key `i` (the first element in the list `palka`) with a value that is either 1 (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or its previous value incremented by 1 (if `i` was already in `d`). For the loop to execute again, `d` would need to reflect the state after processing the first element of `palka`, but since we are looking at the state for the next iteration, `d`'s state concerning the next element of `palka` (which will be the new `i`) is not directly adjustable based on the given information. It will depend on the conditions evaluated in the next iteration.

5. **`w`**, **`ln`**, **`_`**, and **stdin**: These variables are not directly affected by the loop head `for i in palka:`. Their states remain unchanged as per the given problem statement.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time, focusing only on the variables directly affected by the loop head, is:

State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka` if the first element of `palka` was not previously in `pl`, otherwise `pl` remains unchanged, `d` is a dictionary with key `i` (the first element in the list `palka`) and value either 1 (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or its previous value incremented by 1 (if `i` was already in `d`), `_` is 0, stdin contains `w - 1` test cases, and `i` is the second element in the list `palka`.**
