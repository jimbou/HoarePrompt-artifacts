The `print(shapes)` statement will print the number of elements in the list `pl` for which `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.

Since `pl` is a list containing all elements of `palka` with no duplicates and `j` is the last element in the list, `d[j]` refers to the last element in the list `d`. However, the list `d` is not defined in the initial state, so we can't determine its exact value.

Based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the number of elements in `pl` that meet the condition `d[j] >= 3`.

Output: **the number of elements in pl for which d[j] is greater than or equal to 3 (where j is the last element in the list and d is not defined in the initial state)**
