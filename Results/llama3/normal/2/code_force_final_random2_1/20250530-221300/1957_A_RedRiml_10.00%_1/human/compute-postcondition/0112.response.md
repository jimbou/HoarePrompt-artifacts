Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least `len(palka)` elements, `pl` is a list containing all elements of `palka` with no duplicates and must have at least `len(pl)` elements, `_` is 2, `j` is the last element in the list, and `i` is the last element in `palka`. `stdin` contains `w - 4` test cases. `shapes` is equal to the number of elements in `pl` for which `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all elements in the list `pl`, and the value of `shapes` has been updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
