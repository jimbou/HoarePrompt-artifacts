The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and list `pl`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `pl`. If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least `len(palka)` elements, `_` is 2, `shapes` is 0, `stdin` contains `w - 4` test cases, and `i` is the last element in `palka`. So for the loop to be executed  the list `pl` must have at least 1 element and `j` is the first element in the list.
State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least `len(palka)` elements, `pl` is a list containing all elements of `palka` with no duplicates and must have at least 1 element, `_` is 2, `shapes` is 0, `stdin` contains `w - 4` test cases, `j` is the first element in the list, and `i` is the last element in `palka`.**
