Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: w is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 0, ln is an integer, palka is a list of integers, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary, _ is 0, stdin contains w - 1 test cases
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka` if the first element of `palka` was not previously in `pl`, otherwise `pl` remains unchanged, `d` is a dictionary with key `i` (the first element in the list `palka`) and value either 1 (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or its previous value incremented by 1 (if `i` was already in `d`), `_` is 0, stdin contains `w - 1` test cases, and `i` is the first element in the list `palka`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka` and the second element of `palka` if the first element of `palka` was not previously in `pl` and the second element of `palka` was not in `pl`, otherwise `pl` remains unchanged, `d` is a dictionary with key `i` (the first element in the list `palka`) and value either 1 (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or its previous value incremented by 1 (if `i` was already in `d`), `_` is 0, stdin contains `w - 1` test cases, and `i` is the second element in the list `palka`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `d` is a dictionary with key `i` (the first element in the list `palka`) and value either 1 (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or its previous value incremented by 1 (if `i` was already in `d`), `_` is 0, stdin contains `w - 1` test cases. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka`, the second element of `palka` if the first element of `palka` was not previously in `pl` and the second element of `palka` was not in `pl`, and the third element of `palka`. Otherwise, `pl` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
