Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka` and the second element of `palka` if the first element of `palka` was not previously in `pl` and the second element of `palka` was not in `pl`, otherwise `pl` remains unchanged, `d` is a dictionary with key `i` (the first element in the list `palka`) and value 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains `w - 1` test cases, and `i` is the third element in the list `palka`.**

In this output state, the value of `d[i]` has been updated to 1, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `d` now has a key `i` with a value of 1. The rest of the variables retain their initial values and properties.
