The only objects in the loop head are variables  j and pl, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list pl.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, pl has at least 2 elements, j is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the j is the third element in the list.
State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least `len(palka)` elements, `pl` is a list containing all elements of `palka` with no duplicates and must have at least 3 elements, `_` is 2, `j` is the third element in the list, and `i` is the last element in `palka`. `stdin` contains `w - 4` test cases. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is 2. Otherwise, `shapes` is 1.**
