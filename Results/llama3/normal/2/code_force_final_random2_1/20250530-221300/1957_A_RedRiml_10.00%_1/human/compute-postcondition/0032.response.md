Postcondition: ***`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from the original list `palka` that must have at least 2 elements, `d` is a dictionary with keys being all elements from the original list `palka` and values being the frequency of each element, `_` is 0, stdin contains `w - 1` test cases, `j` is the second element in the list. If the frequency of `j` in the dictionary `d` is greater than or equal to 3, then `shapes` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `shapes` remains 0.***
