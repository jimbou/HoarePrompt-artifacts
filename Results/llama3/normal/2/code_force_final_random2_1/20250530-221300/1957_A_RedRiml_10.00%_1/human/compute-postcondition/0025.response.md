Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from the original list `palka`, `d` is a dictionary with keys being all elements from the original list `palka` and values being the frequency of each element, `_` is 0, `shapes` is 0, stdin contains `w - 1` test cases.**

In this output state, all variables from the initial state remain unchanged, and a new variable `shapes` is introduced with a value of 0. The stdin still contains `w - 1` test cases.
