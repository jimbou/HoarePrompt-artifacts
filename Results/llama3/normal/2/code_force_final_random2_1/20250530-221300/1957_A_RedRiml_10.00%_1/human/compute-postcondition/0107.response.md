Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least `len(palka)` elements, `pl` is a list containing all elements of `palka` with no duplicates and must have at least 2 elements, `_` is 2, `j` is the second element in the list, and `i` is the last element in `palka`. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is 2. Otherwise, `shapes` is 1. `stdin` contains `w - 4` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `shapes` has been incremented by 1, regardless of the previous value of `d[j]`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on their values still hold. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same.
