This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the count of elements that appear three or more times in each test case. It accepts no parameters and returns no value, instead printing the results directly. The function iterates through each test case, counts the occurrences of each unique element, and then prints the total count of elements that meet the specified condition.
