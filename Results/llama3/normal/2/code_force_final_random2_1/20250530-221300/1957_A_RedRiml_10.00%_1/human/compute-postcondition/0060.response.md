Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `w - 3` test cases, `i` is the third element in the list `palka`, `pl` is a list containing the first two elements of `palka` and `i`, and the dictionary `d` contains the key `i` with a value that is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or the previous value of `i` in `d` incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `d`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `w` is still an integer between 1 and 100 and greater than 1, `ln` remains an integer, `palka` is still a list of integers with at least 3 elements, the value of `_` is still 1, there are still `w - 3` test cases in `stdin`, `i` is still the third element in the list `palka`, and the dictionary `d` still contains the key `i` with a value that is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or the previous value of `i` in `d` incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `d`. The only change is that `pl` now contains the first two elements of `palka` and `i`.
