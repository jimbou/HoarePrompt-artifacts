The only object in the loop head is variable  j and list pl, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list pl.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, pl has at least 1 element, j is the first element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the j is the second element in the list.
State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from the original list `palka` that must have at least 2 elements, `d` is a dictionary with keys being all elements from the original list `palka` and values being the frequency of each element, `_` is 0, stdin contains `w - 1` test cases, `j` is the second element in the list. If the frequency of `j` in the dictionary `d` is greater than or equal to 3, then `shapes` is 1. Otherwise, `shapes` remains 0.**
