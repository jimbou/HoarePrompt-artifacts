Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka`, the second element of `palka`, and the third element of `palka` if `i` is not in `pl`, otherwise `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka` and the third element of `palka`, `_` is 2, `shapes` is the total count of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`, `stdin` contains `w - 4` test cases, `j` is the last element in the list, `shapes` is being printed, `i` is the third element in `palka`, `d[i]` is either 1 or `d[i]` is incremented by 1.**

The code increments the value of `d[i]` by 1. Since `i` is the third element in `palka`, the value of `d[i]` is either 1 (if `d.get(i)` is `None`) or incremented by 1 (if `d.get(i)` is not `None`). The other variables remain unchanged.
