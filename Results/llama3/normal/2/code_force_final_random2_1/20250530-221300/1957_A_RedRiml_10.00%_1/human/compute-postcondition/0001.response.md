The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `w`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. If `w` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and stdin contains `w` test cases, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `w` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 0, stdin contains `w` test cases, `_` is 0**
