Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `w - 3` test cases, `i` is the second element in the list `palka`, `pl` is a list containing the first two elements of `palka` if `i` is not in `pl`, and `d[i]` is either 2 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or the previous value of `i` in `d` incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `d`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `_`, `stdin`, and `i` remains the same as in the initial state. The value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1, and if `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` contains the first two elements of `palka`.
