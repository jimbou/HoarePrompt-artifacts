Output State: **w is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, ln is an integer, palka is a list of integers, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary, _ is 1, stdin contains w - 3 test cases.**

The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `ln`. Since `w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, and there are `w - 2` test cases in stdin, after reading one integer, there are `w - 3` test cases left in stdin.

The second line reads a list of integers from stdin, splits them into individual integers using the `split()` function, and assigns the resulting list to `palka`. This operation consumes one line of input from stdin, leaving `w - 3` test cases.

The third line initializes an empty list `pl`.

The fourth line initializes an empty dictionary `d`.

No other variables are affected by the code. The value of `w` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `_` also remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The number of elements in `pl` that have a frequency of 3 or more in `d`, which is `shapes`, is not affected by the code, as `pl` and `d` are empty.
