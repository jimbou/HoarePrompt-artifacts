Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `w - 3` test cases, `i` is the first element in the list `palka`, and `d` contains the key `i` with a value that is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or the previous value of `i` in `d` incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `d`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `w` remains an integer between 1 and 100, and greater than 1. The value of `ln` remains an integer. The list `palka` still contains at least one integer. The list `pl` now contains the first element of `palka`. The value of `_` remains 1. There are still `w - 3` test cases in `stdin`. The value of `i` is still the first element in the list `palka`. The dictionary `d` still contains the key `i` with a value that is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or the previous value of `i` in `d` incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `d`.
