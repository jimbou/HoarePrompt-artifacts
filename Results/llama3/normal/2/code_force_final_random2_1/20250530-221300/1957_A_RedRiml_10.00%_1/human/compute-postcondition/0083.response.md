Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary containing a key `i` with a value of `d[i] + 1`, `_` is 2, `shapes` is the total count of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`, `stdin` contains `w - 4` test cases, `j` is the last element in the list, and `shapes` is being printed, `i` is the first element in `palka`.**

In this output state, the value of `d[i]` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `d` now contains the key `i` with an updated value, but the rest of the variables retain their initial values.
