To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(w):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop counter, and `w`, which is the upper limit of the range.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `w` remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `_` is 2
* `w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1

The other variables in the state (`ln`, `palka`, `pl`, `d`, `shapes`, `stdin`, and `j`) are not affected by the loop head and remain unchanged.

State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from the original `palka` list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that element, `_` is 2, `shapes` is the total count of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`, `stdin` contains `w - 3` test cases, `j` is the last element in the list, and the total count of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d` which is `shapes` is being printed**
