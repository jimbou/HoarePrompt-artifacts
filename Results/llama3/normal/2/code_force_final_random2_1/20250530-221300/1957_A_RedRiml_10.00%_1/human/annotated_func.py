#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100).
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        pl = []
        
        d = {}
        
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        
        shapes = 0
        
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += 1
        
        print(shapes)
        
    #State: `w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is equal to 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from the original `palka` list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that element, `_` is `w`, `shapes` is the total count of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`, `stdin` contains 0 test cases, `j` is the last element in the list, and the total count of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d` which is `shapes` is being printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the count of elements that appear three or more times in each test case. It accepts no parameters and returns no value, instead printing the results directly. The function iterates through each test case, counts the occurrences of each unique element, and then prints the total count of elements that meet the specified condition.
