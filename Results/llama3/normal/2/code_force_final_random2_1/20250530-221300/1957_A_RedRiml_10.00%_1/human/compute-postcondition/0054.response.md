Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `w - 3` test cases, `i` is the second element in the list `palka`, `pl` is a list containing the first two elements of `palka` and `i`, and the dictionary `d` contains the key `i` with a value that is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or the previous value of `i` in `d` incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `d`.**

In this output state, the list `pl` has been updated to include the second element `i` of the list `palka`. The other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `d` still contains the key `i` with its corresponding value, which is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or the previous value of `i` in `d` incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `d`.
