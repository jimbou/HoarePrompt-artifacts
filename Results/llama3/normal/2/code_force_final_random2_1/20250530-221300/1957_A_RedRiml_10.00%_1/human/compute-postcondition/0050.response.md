To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `i` and the list `palka`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the list `palka`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first element in the list `palka`, and `palka` must have at least 1 element.

For the loop to execute again, `palka` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` must be the second element in the list `palka`.

State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `w - 3` test cases, and `i` is the second element in the list `palka`. The dictionary `d` contains the key `i` with a value that is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or the previous value of `i` in `d` incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `d`. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is a list containing the first two elements of `palka`.**
