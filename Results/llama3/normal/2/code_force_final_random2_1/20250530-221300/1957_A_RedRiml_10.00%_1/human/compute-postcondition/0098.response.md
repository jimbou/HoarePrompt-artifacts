Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka`, the second element of `palka`, the third element of `palka` and the third element of `palka` again, `_` is 2, `shapes` is the total count of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`, `stdin` contains `w - 4` test cases, `j` is the last element in the list, `shapes` is being printed, `i` is the third element in `palka`, `d[i]` is either 1 or 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `w` remains an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1. The value of `ln` remains an integer. The list `palka` still contains at least 3 elements. The list `pl` now contains the first element of `palka`, the second element of `palka`, the third element of `palka` and the third element of `palka` again. The value of `_` remains 2. The value of `shapes` remains the total count of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`. The stdin still contains `w - 4` test cases. The value of `j` remains the last element in the list. The value of `shapes` is being printed. The value of `i` remains the third element in `palka`. The value of `d[i]` is either 1 or 2.
