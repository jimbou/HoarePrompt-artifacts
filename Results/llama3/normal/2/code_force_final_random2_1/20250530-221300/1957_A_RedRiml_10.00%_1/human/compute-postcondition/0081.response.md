Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and value 1, `_` is 2, `shapes` is the total count of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d` which is 0, `stdin` contains `w - 4` test cases, `j` is the last element in the list, and `shapes` is being printed, `i` is the first element in `palka`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `w` remains the same, `ln` remains the same, `palka` remains the same, `pl` remains empty, `d` now contains `i` as a key with a value of 1, the value of `_` remains 2, `shapes` is still being printed and its value is 0 since `pl` is empty, `stdin` still contains `w - 4` test cases, `j` is still the last element in the list, and `i` is still the first element in `palka`.
