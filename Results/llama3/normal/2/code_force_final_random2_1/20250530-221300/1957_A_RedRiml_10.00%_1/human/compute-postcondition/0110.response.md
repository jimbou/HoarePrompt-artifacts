Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least `len(palka)` elements, `pl` is a list containing all elements of `palka` with no duplicates and must have at least 3 elements, `_` is 2, `j` is the third element in the list, and `i` is the last element in `palka`. `stdin` contains `w - 4` test cases. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is 3. Otherwise, `shapes` is 2.**

The value of `shapes` is incremented by 1. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` was initially 2 and is now 3. Otherwise, `shapes` was initially 1 and is now 2. The values of the other variables are not affected.
