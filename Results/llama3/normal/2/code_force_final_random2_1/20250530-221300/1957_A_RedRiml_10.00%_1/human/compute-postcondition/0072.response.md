Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list containing at least 3 unique elements from the original `palka` list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that element, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `w - 3` test cases, `j` is the third element in the list, `shapes` is 1 if the current value of `d[j]` was greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `shapes` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `shapes` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `d[j]` was greater than or equal to 3, then `shapes` is now 2, otherwise `shapes` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
