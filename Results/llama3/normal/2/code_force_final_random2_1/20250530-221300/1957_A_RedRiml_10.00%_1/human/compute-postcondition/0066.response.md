Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list containing at least 1 unique element from the original `palka` list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that element, `_` is 1, `shapes` is 1, `stdin` contains `w - 3` test cases, `j` is the first element in the list, and the current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `shapes` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `w` is still between 1 and 100 and greater than 1. The list `palka` is still empty, and `pl` still contains at least one unique element from the original `palka` list. The dictionary `d` still maps each key from the original `palka` list to its count of occurrences. The value of `_` is still 1. The number of test cases in `stdin` is still `w - 3`. The value of `j` is still the first element in the list, and the count of `j` in dictionary `d` is still greater than or equal to 3.
