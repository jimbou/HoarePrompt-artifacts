Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is equal to 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from the original `palka` list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that element, `_` is `w`, `shapes` is the total count of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`, `stdin` contains 0 test cases, `j` is the last element in the list, and the total count of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d` which is `shapes` is being printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has executed all the iterations, and the variables have reached their final state. The loop counter `_` is equal to the initial value of `w`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The lists `palka` and `pl` are empty, and the dictionary `d` contains the frequency of each element in the original list. The variable `shapes` holds the total count of elements in `pl` that have a frequency of 3 or more in `d`. The standard input `stdin` is empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
