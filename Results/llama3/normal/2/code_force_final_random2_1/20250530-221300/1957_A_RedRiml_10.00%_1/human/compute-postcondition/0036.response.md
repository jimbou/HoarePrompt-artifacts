Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with keys being all elements from the original list `palka` and values being the frequency of each element, `_` is 0, stdin contains `w - 1` test cases, `shapes` is the number of elements in `pl` that have a frequency of 3 or more in `d`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same values for all variables except `pl` and `shapes`. The list `pl` will be empty because it contains all unique elements from the original list `palka`, which is empty. The variable `shapes` will be the total number of elements in `pl` that have a frequency of 3 or more in the dictionary `d`.
