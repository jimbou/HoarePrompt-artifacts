To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `palka`. The loop will execute if `palka` has at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `palka` to ensure it has at least one element.

State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `_` is 2, `shapes` is the total count of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`, `stdin` contains `w - 4` test cases, `j` is the last element in the list, and `shapes` is being printed, `i` is the first element in `palka`**
