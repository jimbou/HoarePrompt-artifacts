Postcondition: ***`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list containing at least 2 unique elements from the original `palka` list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that element, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `w - 3` test cases, `j` is the second element in the list. If the current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, then `shapes` is 1, otherwise `shapes` remains 0.***
