Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka` and the second element of `palka`, `_` is 2, `shapes` is the total count of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`, `stdin` contains `w - 4` test cases, `j` is the last element in the list, `shapes` is being printed, `i` is the second element in `palka`, `d[i]` is incremented by 1 if `d.get(i)` is not `None`, otherwise `d[i]` is set to 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `w` remains the same, between 1 and 100 and greater than 1. The value of `ln` also remains the same. The list `palka` still has at least 2 elements. The list `pl` now contains the first element of `palka` and the second element of `palka`. The value of `_` is still 2. The value of `shapes` is still the total count of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`. The number of test cases in `stdin` is still `w - 4`. The value of `j` is still the last element in the list. The value of `shapes` is still being printed. The value of `i` is still the second element in `palka`. The value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1 if `d.get(i)` is not `None`, otherwise `d[i]` is set to 1.
