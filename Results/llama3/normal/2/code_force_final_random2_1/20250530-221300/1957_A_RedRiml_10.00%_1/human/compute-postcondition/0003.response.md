The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and list `palka`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `palka`. If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, w is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 0, ln is an integer, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary, _ is 0, stdin contains w - 1 test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the i is the first element in the list.
State: **w is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 0, ln is an integer, palka is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary, _ is 0, stdin contains w - 1 test cases, i is the first element in the list**
