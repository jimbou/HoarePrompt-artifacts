Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from the original `palka` list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that element, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `w - 3` test cases.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state is as follows: The value of `w` remains unchanged, `ln` remains an integer, the list `palka` becomes empty because all its elements have been processed, the list `pl` contains all unique elements from the original `palka` list, the dictionary `d` contains the count of occurrences of each element from the original `palka` list, the value of `_` remains 1, and `stdin` still contains `w - 3` test cases.
