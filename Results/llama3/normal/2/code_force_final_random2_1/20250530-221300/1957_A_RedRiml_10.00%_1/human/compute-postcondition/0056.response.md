The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `palka`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `palka`.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `palka` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the `i` is the third element in the list.
State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `w - 3` test cases, and `i` is the third element in the list `palka`. The dictionary `d` contains the key `i` with a value that is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or the previous value of `i` in `d` incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `d`. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is a list containing the first two elements of `palka` and `i`, otherwise `pl` remains unchanged.**
