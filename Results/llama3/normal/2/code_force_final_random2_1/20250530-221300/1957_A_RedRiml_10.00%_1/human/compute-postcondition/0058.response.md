Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `w - 3` test cases, `i` is the third element in the list `palka`, `d[i]` is either 2 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or the previous value of `i` in `d` incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `d`, and `pl` is either a list containing the first two elements of `palka` and `i` if `i` is not in `pl`, or remains unchanged if `i` is in `pl`.**

In this output state, the value of `d[i]` has been updated to be either 2 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or the previous value of `i` in `d` incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `d`. The other variables remain unchanged.
