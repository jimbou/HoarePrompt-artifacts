Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is `n-1`, `el` is either '<' or '>'**.

In this output state, the value of `el` is either '<' or '>' because `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `el` is assigned the value of `s1[i]`, where `i` is `n-1`. The values of the other variables are not affected by the code.
