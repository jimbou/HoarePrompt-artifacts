Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0 or two elements 0 and `n`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is either zeroInd - oneInd if the number of '>' characters is less than or equal to the number of '<' characters, or zeroInd - oneInd + `n` + 1 - `fi` if the number of '>' characters is more than the number of '<' characters, or suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2] - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + `n` + 1 if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `i` is `n-1`, `el` is either '<' or '>', `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `zr` is 0 or 1. If `el` is '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus one, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1` with the last element removed. If `el` is '<', `suffZero` is a list containing two elements 0 and `n`, `zr` is 1. If `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `ans` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `n-1` is suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2] - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + `n` + 1. Otherwise, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is zeroInd - oneInd.
