Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is `n-1`, `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `zr` is 0, and `el` is still '>'. The number of '>' characters in `s1` is more than the number of '<' characters***
