Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements 0 and n, ans is a list of n integers where the value at index n-1 is suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2] - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + n + 1, i is n-1, el is '<', ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 1, and the current value of zr is less than or equal to the current value of ol.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The string `s1` remains unchanged, consisting of `n` characters that are either '<' or '>'. The value of `n` also remains the same, being a positive integer. The list `pre` still contains the 1-indexed positions of '>' characters in `s1`, and `totalOne` continues to represent the count of '>' characters in `s1`. The list `preOne` maintains its values as the cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`. The list `suffZero` still contains two elements: 0 and `n`. The list `ans` has been modified, with its value at index `n-1` now being the result of the expression `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2] - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + n + 1`. The variable `i` remains at `n-1`, `el` is still '<', `ol` is still the count of '>' characters in `s1`, and `zr` is still 1, with its value being less than or equal to `ol`.
