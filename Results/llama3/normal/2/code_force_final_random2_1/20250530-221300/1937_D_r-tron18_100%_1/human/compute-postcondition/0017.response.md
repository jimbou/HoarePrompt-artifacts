Postcondition: ***s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements 0 and n, i is n-1, el is '<', ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 1. If zr is less than or equal to ol, ans is a list of n integers where the value at index n-1 is suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2] - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + n + 1. Otherwise, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is zeroInd - oneInd.***
