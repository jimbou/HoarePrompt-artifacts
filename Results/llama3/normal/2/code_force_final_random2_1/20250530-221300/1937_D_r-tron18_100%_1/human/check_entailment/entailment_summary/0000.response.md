Reasoning: 

The problem requires calculating the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave a grid of length n, where each cell contains a character '<' or '>'. The pinball moves according to certain rules, and the task is to answer n independent queries, each placing a pinball on a different cell.

Function 2 (func_2) takes a string s1 of '<' and '>' characters and an integer n as input. It calculates a sequence of values based on the arrangement of '<' and '>' characters in the input string. For each '>' character, it calculates a value based on the number of '<' characters to its right and the number of '>' characters to its left. For each '<' character, it calculates a value based on the number of '<' characters to its right and the number of '>' characters to its left. The function returns a list of these calculated values, one for each character in the input string.

Function 1 (func_1) is a helper function used by func_2. It calculates the difference between the last element of a list and an element a specified number of positions from the end, wrapping around to the start of the list if necessary.

The main program iterates over multiple test cases, reading the number of test cases, the length of the grid, and the string of '<' and '>' characters for each test case. It then calls func_2 with the input string and length, which calculates and prints the list of values for each test case.

Based on the problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, it appears that the program correctly implements the required logic to calculate the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each query.

Correctness: **True**
