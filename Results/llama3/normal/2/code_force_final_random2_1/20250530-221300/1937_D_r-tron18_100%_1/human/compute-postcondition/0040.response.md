Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements, ans is a list of n elements with the value at index i being zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1, i is n-3, el is the character at index n-3 in s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 1.**

The code snippet modifies the value of `ans[i]` by assigning it the result of the expression `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. The value of `zeroInd` is calculated as the sum of the last two elements of `suffZero`, and the value of `oneInd` is calculated as twice the result of calling `func_1(preOne, zr)`. The values of `suffZero`, `preOne`, and `zr` are not modified by the code. The values of `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `i`, `el`, and `ol` are also not modified by the code.
