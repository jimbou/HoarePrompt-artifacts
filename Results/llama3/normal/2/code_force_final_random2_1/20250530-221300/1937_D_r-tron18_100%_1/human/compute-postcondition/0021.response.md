Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing either one or two elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements, `i` is `n-2`, `el` is either '<' or '>' and is equal to the character at index `n-2` in `s1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s1` still has a length of `n` and consists of '<' and '>' characters. The number of '>' characters in `s1` is still `totalOne`, and their indices are still stored in `pre`. The cumulative sums of these indices are still stored in `preOne`. The list `suffZero` still contains one or two elements. The list `ans` still has `n` elements. The index `i` is still `n-2`. The variable `el` now holds the character at index `n-2` in `s1`, which can be either '<' or '>'.
