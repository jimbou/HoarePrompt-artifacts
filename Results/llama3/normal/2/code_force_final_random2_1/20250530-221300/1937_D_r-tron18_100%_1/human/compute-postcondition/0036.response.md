Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing either one or two elements, ans is a list of n elements with the value at index i updated, i is n-3, el is the character at index n-3 in s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is the second last element of suffZero if it exists, otherwise it is the last element of suffZero**

The code block calculates and updates the value of `ans` at index `i` based on the values of `suffZero`, `preOne`, `n`, and `zr`. The variables `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `i`, `el`, `ol`, and `zr` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` at index `i` is updated using the calculated values of `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi`.
