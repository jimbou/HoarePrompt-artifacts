Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query. It uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from the left and right sides, respectively.

The program correctly handles the cases where the pinball moves to the left or right, and it correctly updates the grid after each move. It also correctly handles the cases where the pinball leaves the grid from the left or right border.

The program uses the `accumulate` function from the `itertools` module to efficiently calculate the cumulative sum of the indices of the '>' characters, which is used to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the pinball is placed on the first or last cell of the grid.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and it handles all the potential cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
