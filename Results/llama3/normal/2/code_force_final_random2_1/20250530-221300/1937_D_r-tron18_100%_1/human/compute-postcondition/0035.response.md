Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing either one or two elements, ans is a list of n elements with the value at index i updated to zeroInd - oneInd, i is n-3, el is the character at index n-3 in s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is the second last element of suffZero if it exists, otherwise it is the last element of suffZero**.

The code snippet updates the value of `ans` at index `i` to `zeroInd - oneInd`, where `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)` and `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. The values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are not explicitly provided, but they are calculated based on the existing values of `suffZero`, `ol`, `preOne`, and the function `func_1`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
