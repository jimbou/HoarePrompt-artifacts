Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements, ans is a list of n elements with the value at index i being the difference between twice the result of func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) minus the result of func_1(suffZero, 1) and twice the last element of preOne, i is n-3, el is the character at index n-3 in s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 1.**

The code snippet calculates the value of `zeroInd` and `oneInd` based on the provided functions `func_1` and the values of `suffZero`, `ol`, and `preOne`. It then assigns the difference between `zeroInd` and `oneInd` to the `i-th` index of the list `ans`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
