Postcondition: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing either one or two elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements. If `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, then the element at index `n-2` of `ans` is the difference between twice the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)` and twice the last element of `preOne` minus the result of `func_1(preOne, 1)`. Otherwise, `ans[n-2]` is equal to 2 * `suffZero[-1]` - (`func_1(preOne, zr)` + `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)` - `func_1(preOne, 1)`) + `n` + 1 - (`func_1(preOne, zr + 1)` - `func_1(preOne, zr)`).**
