Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements, the last element being suffZero[-1] + i + 1, ans is a list of n elements with ans[i] being zeroInd - oneInd, i is n-2, el is either '<' or '>' and is equal to the character at index n-2 in s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 1.**

The code snippet calculates the value of `zeroInd` and `oneInd` using the provided functions `func_1` and the values of `suffZero`, `ol`, and `preOne`. It then assigns the difference between `zeroInd` and `oneInd` to `ans[i]`. The values of `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `i`, `el`, `ol`, and `zr` remain unchanged.
