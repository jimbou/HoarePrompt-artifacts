Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing either one or two elements, ans is a list of n elements where the element at index n-2 is the difference between twice the result of func_1(suffZero, ol) and twice the last element of preOne minus the result of func_1(preOne, 1), i is n-2, el is either '<' or '>' and is equal to the character at index n-2 in s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is the second last element of suffZero if suffZero has two elements, otherwise zr is the last element of suffZero.**

In this output state, the only change from the initial state is the value of the element at index `n-2` in the list `ans`. This value is calculated using the provided functions `func_1` and the values of `suffZero`, `ol`, `preOne`, and `n`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
