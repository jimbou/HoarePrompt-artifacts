Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing either one or two elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements, `i` is `n-2`, `el` is either '<' or '>' and is equal to the character at index `n-2` in `s1`, `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `zr` is the second last element of `suffZero` if `suffZero` has two elements, otherwise `zr` is the last element of `suffZero`.**

In this output state, the values of `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `i`, and `el` remain unchanged. The new variables `ol` and `zr` are introduced, where `ol` is equal to the number of '>' characters in `s1` (i.e., `totalOne`) and `zr` is the second last element of `suffZero` if `suffZero` has two elements, otherwise `zr` is the last element of `suffZero`.
