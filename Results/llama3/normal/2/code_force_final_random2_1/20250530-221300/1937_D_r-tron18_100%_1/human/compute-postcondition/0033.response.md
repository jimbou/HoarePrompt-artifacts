Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing either one or two elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements, `i` is `n-3`, `el` is the character at index `n-3` in `s1`.**

In this output state, the value of `el` has been updated to be the character at index `n-3` in `s1`, which is either '<' or '>'. The other variables remain unchanged.
