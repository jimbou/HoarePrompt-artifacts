Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, ans is a list of n zeros
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    el = s1[i]
    if el == '>':
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if ol <= zr:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
            oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
            oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
            fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
        preOne.pop()
        totalOne -= 1
    else:
        suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if zr <= ol:
            zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
            oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing either one or two elements, ans is a list of n elements, i is n-1, el is either '<' or '>'. If el is '>', then totalOne is decreased by one, preOne has its last element removed, and the last element of ans is either zeroInd - oneInd if the number of '>' characters is less than or equal to the number of '<' characters, or zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi if the number of '>' characters is more than the number of '<' characters. If el is '<', then suffZero contains two elements 0 and n, and the last element of ans is either suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2] - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + n + 1 if zr is less than or equal to ol, or zeroInd - oneInd otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing either one or two elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements, `i` is `n-2`, `el` is either '<' or '>' and is equal to the character at index `n-2` in `s1`. If `el` is '>', then `totalOne` is decreased by 1 and the last element of `preOne` is removed. If `el` is '<', then `suffZero` contains two elements, the last element being `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, and if the number of '>' characters in `s1` is less than or equal to the number of '<' characters in `s1`, then the value at index `i` in `ans` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, otherwise it is `zeroInd - oneInd`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing either one or two elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements, `i` is `n-3`, `el` is the character at index `n-3` in `s1`. If `el` is '>', then `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus one, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1` with the last element removed, and `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus one, `zr` is the second last element of `suffZero` if it exists, otherwise it is the last element of `suffZero`. If `el` is '<', then `suffZero` is a list containing two elements, `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, and `zr` is 1. If `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, the value at index `i` in `ans` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. Otherwise, the value at index `i` in `ans` is the difference between twice the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` minus the result of `func_1(suffZero, 1)` and twice the last element of `preOne`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
