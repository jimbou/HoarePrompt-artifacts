Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements 0 and n, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is zeroInd - oneInd, i is n-1, el is '<', ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 1, and zr is larger than ol.**

In this output state, the value of `ans[i]` has been updated to `zeroInd - oneInd`, where `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` and `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1]`. The values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are not explicitly provided, but they are calculated based on the values of `suffZero`, `ol`, and `preOne` from the initial state. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
