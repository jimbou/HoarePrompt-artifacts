Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
* `pre` is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in `s1`.
* `totalOne` is 0.
* `preOne` is an empty list.
* `suffZero` is a list containing `n+1` elements.
* `ans` is a list of `n` elements.
* `i` is -1.
* `el` is '<'.

The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list.

Since `ans` is a list of `n` elements, and `n` is a positive integer, the output will be a sequence of `n` values.

However, without knowing the specific values of `s1` and the operations performed on `ans` before the print statement, we cannot determine the exact values that will be printed.

But we can describe the output as:

Output: **a sequence of n values (where n is the length of the string s1)**

Note that the output will be a sequence of values, not a single value, since `ans` is a list of `n` elements.
