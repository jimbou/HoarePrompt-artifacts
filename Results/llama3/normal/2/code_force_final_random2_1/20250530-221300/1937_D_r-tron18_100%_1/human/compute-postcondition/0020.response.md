To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is greater than -1.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decreased by 1, so `i` becomes `n-2`.

The state of `n` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The state of the other variables (`s1`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, and `el`) does not need to be adjusted, as they are not in the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing either one or two elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements, `i` is `n-2`, `el` is either '<' or '>'**
