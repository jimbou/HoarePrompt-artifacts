Postcondition: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing either one or two elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements, `i` is `n-2`, `el` is either '<' or '>' and is equal to the character at index `n-2` in `s1`. If `el` is '>', then `totalOne` is decreased by 1 and the last element of `preOne` is removed. If `el` is '<', then `suffZero` contains two elements, the last element being `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, and if the number of '>' characters in `s1` is less than or equal to the number of '<' characters in `s1`, then the value at index `i` in `ans` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, otherwise it is `zeroInd - oneInd`.**
