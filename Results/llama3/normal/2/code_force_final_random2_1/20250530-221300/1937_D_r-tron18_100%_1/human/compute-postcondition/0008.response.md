Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi, i is n-1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 0, and el is still '>'. The number of '>' characters in s1 is more than the number of '<' characters.**

In this output state, the value of `ans[i]` has been updated based on the calculations involving `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, `fi`, and other variables. The rest of the variables remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code snippet.
