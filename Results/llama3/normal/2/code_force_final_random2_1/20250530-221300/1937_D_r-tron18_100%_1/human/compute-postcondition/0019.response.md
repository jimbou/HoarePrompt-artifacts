Postcondition: ***s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing either one or two elements, ans is a list of n elements, i is n-1, el is either '<' or '>'. If el is '>', then totalOne is decreased by one, preOne has its last element removed, and the last element of ans is either zeroInd - oneInd if the number of '>' characters is less than or equal to the number of '<' characters, or zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi if the number of '>' characters is more than the number of '<' characters. If el is '<', then suffZero contains two elements 0 and n, and the last element of ans is either suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2] - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + n + 1 if zr is less than or equal to ol, or zeroInd - oneInd otherwise.***
