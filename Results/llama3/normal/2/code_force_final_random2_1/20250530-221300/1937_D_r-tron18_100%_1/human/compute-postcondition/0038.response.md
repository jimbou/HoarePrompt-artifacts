Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus one, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1` with the last element removed, `suffZero` is a list containing either one or two elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements, `i` is `n-3`, `el` is the character at index `n-3` in `s1`, `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus one, `zr` is the second last element of `suffZero` if it exists, otherwise it is the last element of `suffZero`.**

The code modifies the values of `totalOne` and `preOne`. The first line removes the last element from `preOne`, which is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`. The second line decrements `totalOne` by 1, which is the number of '>' characters in `s1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
