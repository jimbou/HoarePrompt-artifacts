Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1 minus one, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1 with the last element removed, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is either zeroInd - oneInd if the number of '>' characters is less than or equal to the number of '<' characters, or zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi if the number of '>' characters is more than the number of '<' characters, i is n-1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1 minus one, zr is 0, and el is still '>'.**

In this output state, the code has modified the values of `totalOne` and `preOne`. The value of `totalOne` has been decremented by 1, reflecting the removal of one '>' character from the string `s1`. The list `preOne` has been modified by removing its last element, which represents the cumulative sum of indices of '>' characters up to the second last '>' character. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
