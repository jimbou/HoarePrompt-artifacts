Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, ans is a list of n zeros**.

Here's a breakdown of the final state:

* `s1` remains unchanged as a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
* `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer.
* `pre` is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in `s1`. This means that for each '>' character in `s1`, its index (plus 1) is added to the `pre` list.
* `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, which is the length of the `pre` list.
* `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`. This means that each element in `preOne` is the sum of all indices of '>' characters up to that point in `s1`.
* `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0.
* `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.

Note that the code does not modify the original string `s1` or the value of `n`. It only creates new variables and lists based on the contents of `s1`.
