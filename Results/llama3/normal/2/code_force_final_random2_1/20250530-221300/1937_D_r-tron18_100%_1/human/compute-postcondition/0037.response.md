Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing either one or two elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements. If `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, the value at index `i` in `ans` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd`. Otherwise, the value at index `i` in `ans` is updated. `i` is `n-3`, `el` is the character at index `n-3` in `s1`, `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `zr` is the second last element of `suffZero` if it exists, otherwise it is the last element of `suffZero`***
