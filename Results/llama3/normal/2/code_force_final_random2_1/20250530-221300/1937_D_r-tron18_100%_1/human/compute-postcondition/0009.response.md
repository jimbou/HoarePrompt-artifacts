Postcondition: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is either `zeroInd - oneInd` if the number of '>' characters is less than or equal to the number of '<' characters, or `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi` if the number of '>' characters is more than the number of '<' characters, `i` is `n-1`, `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `zr` is 0, and `el` is still '>'.**
