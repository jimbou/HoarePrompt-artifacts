Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements 0 and n, ans is a list of n zeros, i is n-1, el is '<', ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 1.**

The code executes two lines. The first line appends the value of `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` to `suffZero`. Since `suffZero` initially contains a single element 0, and `i` is `n-1`, `suffZero` becomes a list containing two elements 0 and `n`. The second line assigns the value of `totalOne` to `ol` and the value of `len(suffZero) - 1` to `zr`. Since `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `ol` becomes the number of '>' characters in `s1`. Since `suffZero` now contains two elements, `zr` becomes 1. No other variables are affected.
