Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is 0, preOne is an empty list, suffZero is a list containing n+1 elements, ans is a list of n elements, i is -1, el is '<'.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the loop has finished executing and all the iterations have been completed. The string s1 remains unchanged, the list pre remains unchanged, the variable totalOne is 0, the list preOne is empty, the list suffZero contains n+1 elements, the list ans contains n elements, the variable i is -1, and the variable el is '<'. This state indicates that the loop has finished executing and all the iterations have been completed.
