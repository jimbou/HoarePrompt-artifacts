Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing either one or two elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements, `i` is `n-3`, `el` is the character at index `n-3` in `s1`. If `el` is '>', then `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus one, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1` with the last element removed, and `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus one, `zr` is the second last element of `suffZero` if it exists, otherwise it is the last element of `suffZero`. If `el` is '<', then `suffZero` is a list containing two elements, `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, and `zr` is 1. If `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, the value at index `i` in `ans` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. Otherwise, the value at index `i` in `ans` is the difference between twice the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` minus the result of `func_1(suffZero, 1)` and twice the last element of `preOne`.***
