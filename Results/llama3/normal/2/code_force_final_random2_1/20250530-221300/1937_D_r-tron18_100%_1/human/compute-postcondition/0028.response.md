Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements, the last element being suffZero[-1] + i + 1, ans is a list of n elements with the value at index i being zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1, i is n-2, el is either '<' or '>' and is equal to the character at index n-2 in s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 1.**

The code calculates the value of `zeroInd` by adding the last two elements of the `suffZero` list. It then calculates the value of `oneInd` by calling the function `func_1` with the `preOne` list and the value of `zr` as arguments, and multiplying the result by 2. The value of `ans[i]` is then set to the difference between `zeroInd` and `oneInd`, plus `n + 1`. The values of `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `i`, `el`, `ol`, and `zr` remain unchanged.
