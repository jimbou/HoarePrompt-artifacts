#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers and times is a non-negative integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates the difference between the last element of a list and an element a specified number of positions from the end, wrapping around to the start of the list if necessary.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a string of '<' and '>' characters as input and returns a list of integers. The function calculates a sequence of values based on the arrangement of '<' and '>' characters in the input string. For each '>' character, it calculates a value based on the number of '<' characters to its right and the number of '>' characters to its left. For each '<' character, it calculates a value based on the number of '<' characters to its right and the number of '>' characters to its left. The function returns a list of these calculated values, one for each character in the input string.
