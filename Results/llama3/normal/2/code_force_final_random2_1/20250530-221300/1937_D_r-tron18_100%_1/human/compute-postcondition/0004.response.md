Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is `n-1`, `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `zr` is 0, and `el` is still '>'**

In this output state, the values of `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged. The new variables `ol` and `zr` are introduced, where `ol` is assigned the value of `totalOne`, which is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, and `zr` is assigned the value of `len(suffZero) - 1`, which is 0 since `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0. The value of `el` remains unchanged as '>'.
