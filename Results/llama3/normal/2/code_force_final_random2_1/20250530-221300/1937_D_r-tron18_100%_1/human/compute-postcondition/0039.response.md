Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements, ans is a list of n elements, i is n-3, el is the character at index n-3 in s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 1.**

The code snippet modifies the `suffZero` list by appending a new element, which is the sum of the last element in `suffZero` and the value of `i` plus 1. The value of `i` is `n-3`, so the new element in `suffZero` is `suffZero[-1] + n - 3 + 1 = suffZero[-1] + n - 2`. The length of `suffZero` is now 2.

The code also assigns the value of `totalOne` to `ol`, which is the number of '>' characters in `s1`. The value of `zr` is set to `len(suffZero) - 1`, which is 1.

All other variables remain unchanged.
