Postcondition: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements, ans is a list of n elements, i is n-3, el is the character at index n-3 in s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 1. If zr is less than or equal to ol, the value at index i in ans is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1. Otherwise, the value at index i in ans is the difference between twice the result of func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) minus the result of func_1(suffZero, 1) and twice the last element of preOne.**
