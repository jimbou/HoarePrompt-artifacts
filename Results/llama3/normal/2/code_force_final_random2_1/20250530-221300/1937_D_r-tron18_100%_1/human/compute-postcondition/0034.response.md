Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing either one or two elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements, `i` is `n-3`, `el` is the character at index `n-3` in `s1`, `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `zr` is the second last element of `suffZero` if it exists, otherwise it is the last element of `suffZero`**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of two new variables `ol` and `zr`. `ol` is assigned the value of `totalOne`, which is the number of '>' characters in `s1`. `zr` is assigned the value of the second last element of `suffZero` if it exists, otherwise it is the last element of `suffZero`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
