Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1 minus 1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1 with the last element removed, suffZero is a list containing either one or two elements, ans is a list of n elements.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `totalOne` and `preOne`. The first line removes the last element from `preOne`, which is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`. The second line decrements `totalOne` by 1, which represents the number of '>' characters in `s1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
