Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the outcome of a game played on a checkered board by two players, Alice and Bob. The game's rules and constraints are provided in the problem description.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program iterates over multiple test cases, where each test case represents a game scenario.
2.  For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the board (`h` and `w`) and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (`xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`).
3.  If Alice's chip is initially positioned above Bob's chip (`xa > xb`), the program immediately outputs "Draw" because Alice cannot win in this scenario.
4.  Otherwise, the program calculates the number of rows (`x`) that Alice needs to move to reach Bob's initial row. If the difference in rows is odd, it means Alice will have an extra move.
5.  The program then determines the possible range of columns (`l` and `r`) that Bob's chip can occupy when Alice reaches his row. This range is calculated based on the number of rows Alice needs to move and the width of the board.
6.  If the difference in rows is odd, the program checks if Alice can win by verifying if her chip's column (`ya`) is within the possible range of columns (`l` and `r`) that Bob's chip can occupy. If it is, the program outputs "Alice"; otherwise, it outputs "Draw".
7.  If the difference in rows is even, the program checks if Bob can win by verifying if his chip's column (`yb`) is within the possible range of columns (`l` and `r`) that Alice's chip can occupy. If it is, the program outputs "Bob"; otherwise, it outputs "Draw".

The program's logic is based on the fact that the game is symmetric, and the players' moves are mirror images of each other. By analyzing the possible moves and positions of the chips, the program can determine the outcome of the game.

Correctness: **True**
