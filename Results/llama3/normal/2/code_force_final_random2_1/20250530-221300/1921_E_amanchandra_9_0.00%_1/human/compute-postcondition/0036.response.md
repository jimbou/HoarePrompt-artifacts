To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given print statement and the initial state:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `h` and `w` are integers.
   - `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `x` is the integer part of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2.
   - `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`.
   - `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.
   - `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - `print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1])`

This statement uses list indexing based on a condition. The condition checks if both `abs(l - ya)` and `abs(r - ya)` are less than or equal to `x + 1`. If this condition is true, it prints `'Alice'`; otherwise, it prints `'Draw'`.

Given the initial state, we can describe the values of `l`, `r`, and `x` in terms of the given variables:

- `x` is the integer part of `|xa - xb| / 2`.
- `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`.
- `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.

However, without explicit values for `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `w`, and `h`, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `x`, `l`, and `r`, nor can we evaluate the condition `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` directly.

Therefore, the output depends on whether the condition `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` is true or false based on the values of `l`, `r`, `x`, and `ya`.

Output: **'Alice' if the condition is true, 'Draw' if the condition is false**
