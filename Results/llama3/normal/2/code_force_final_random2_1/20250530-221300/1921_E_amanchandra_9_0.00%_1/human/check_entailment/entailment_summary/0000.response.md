Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. If Alice's chip is above Bob's chip (xa > xb), the program prints 'Draw' because Alice cannot win in this case.

2. If Alice's chip is below or at the same row as Bob's chip (xa <= xb), the program calculates the number of rows (x) that Alice needs to move to reach Bob's row.

3. If the number of rows is odd (abs(xa - xb) % 2), the program checks if Alice can reach Bob's chip in the next move. It calculates the left and right boundaries (l and r) of the possible moves and checks if Alice's chip is within these boundaries. If it is, the program prints 'Alice'; otherwise, it prints 'Draw'.

4. If the number of rows is even (abs(xa - xb) % 2 == 0), the program checks if Bob can reach Alice's chip in the next move. It calculates the left and right boundaries (l and r) of the possible moves and checks if Bob's chip is within these boundaries. If it is, the program prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Draw'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
