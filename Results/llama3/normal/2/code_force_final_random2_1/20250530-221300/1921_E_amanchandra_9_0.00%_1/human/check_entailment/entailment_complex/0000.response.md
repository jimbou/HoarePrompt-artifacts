Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first checks if `xa > xb`. If this condition is true, it means that Alice's chip is already in a position where she cannot win, so the program prints 'Draw'.

2. If `xa <= xb`, the program calculates the integer part of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2, and stores it in the variable `x`.

3. If `abs(xa - xb)` is odd, the program calculates the range of possible positions that Alice's chip can reach in `x + 1` moves. It checks if Bob's chip is within this range, and if so, prints 'Alice'. Otherwise, it prints 'Draw'.

4. If `abs(xa - xb)` is even, the program calculates the range of possible positions that Bob's chip can reach in `x` moves. It checks if Alice's chip is within this range, and if so, prints 'Bob'. Otherwise, it prints 'Draw'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
