Output State: **h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb are integers, i is 1, x is the integer division of the absolute difference between xa and xb by 2, l is the maximum of 1 and yb - x, r is the minimum of w and yb + x**

The code snippet assigns the maximum value between 1 and `yb - x` to `l`, and the minimum value between `w` and `yb + x` to `r`. The values of `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged. The code does not affect the number of test cases in stdin.
