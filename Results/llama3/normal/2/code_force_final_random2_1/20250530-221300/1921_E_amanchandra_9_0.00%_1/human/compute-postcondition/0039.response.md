To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet.

Given:
- `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers.
- `i` is 2.
- `x` is the integer part of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2.
- `l` is the maximum of 1 and `ya - x`.
- `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])
```

This code uses list indexing to select either `'Draw'` or `'Bob'` based on the condition `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x`. The `*` operator is used to unpack the selected list into arguments for the `print` function, effectively printing the selected string.

To understand what will be printed, let's analyze the condition:

1. `abs(l - yb) <= x`: This checks if the absolute difference between `l` (the maximum of 1 and `ya - x`) and `yb` is less than or equal to `x`.
2. `abs(r - yb) <= x`: This checks if the absolute difference between `r` (the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`) and `yb` is less than or equal to `x`.

Both conditions must be true for the expression to evaluate to `True`, in which case the code prints `'Draw'`. If either condition is false, the expression evaluates to `False`, and the code prints `'Bob'`.

Since the exact values of `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `x`, `l`, and `r` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of the conditions. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either `'Draw'` or `'Bob'` depending on whether the conditions are met.

Output: **'Draw' if the conditions abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x are both true, otherwise 'Bob'**
