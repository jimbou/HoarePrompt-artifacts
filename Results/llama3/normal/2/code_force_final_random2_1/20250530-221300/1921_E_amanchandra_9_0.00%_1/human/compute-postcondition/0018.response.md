Output State: **`h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the values of `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers, which are assigned from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. The value of `i` remains 1, as it is not affected by the code. The stdin now contains one less test case, as one test case has been read and processed.
