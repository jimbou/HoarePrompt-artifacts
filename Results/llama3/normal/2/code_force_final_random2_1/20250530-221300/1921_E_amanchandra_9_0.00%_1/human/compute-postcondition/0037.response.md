The code prints either 'Draw' or 'Alice' based on the conditions `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`. The value of `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`, the value of `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`, the value of `x` is the integer part of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2, the value of `ya` is an integer, the value of `yb` is an integer, and the value of `w` is an integer.

Output: **h is an integer, w is an integer, xa is an integer, ya is an integer, xb is an integer, yb is an integer, i is 2, x is the integer part of the absolute difference between xa and xb divided by 2, l is the maximum of 1 and yb - x, r is the minimum of w and yb + x, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, and either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed based on the conditions `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`**
