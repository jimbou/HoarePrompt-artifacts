The code prints either 'Draw' or 'Bob' based on the conditions `abs(l - yb) <= x` and `abs(r - yb) <= x`. Where l is the maximum of 1 and ya - x, r is the minimum of w and yb + x, x is the integer part of the absolute difference between xa and xb divided by 2, and yb is an integer.

Output: **h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb are integers, i is 2, x is the integer part of the absolute difference between xa and xb divided by 2, l is the maximum of 1 and ya - x, r is the minimum of w and yb + x, and either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed based on the conditions `abs(l - yb) <= x` and `abs(r - yb) <= x`**
