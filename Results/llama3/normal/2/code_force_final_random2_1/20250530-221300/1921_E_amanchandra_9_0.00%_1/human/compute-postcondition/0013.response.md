The `print` statement is using a conditional expression to determine what to print. The expression `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x` is evaluated, and based on its truthiness, either the string `'Draw'` or the string `'Bob'` is printed.

The variables `l`, `r`, `yb`, and `x` are used in this expression. `l` and `r` are integers between 1 and `w`, `yb` is an integer, and `x` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to `(xb - xa) / 2`.

The absolute difference between `l` and `yb` is compared to `x`, and the absolute difference between `r` and `yb` is also compared to `x`. If both absolute differences are less than or equal to `x`, the expression is true, and `'Draw'` is printed. Otherwise, `'Bob'` is printed.

Since the exact values of `l`, `r`, `yb`, and `x` are not provided, we can't determine the exact output. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either `'Draw'` or `'Bob'` based on the conditions described.

Output: **'Draw' if abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x, otherwise 'Bob'**
