The code prints a list containing either the string 'Draw' or 'Bob' based on the conditions `abs(l - yb) <= x` and `abs(r - yb) <= x`. The value of `l` is the maximum of 1 and `ya - x`, and the value of `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`. The value of `x` is the integer division of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` by 2.

Output: **['Draw'] if abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x, otherwise ['Bob']**
