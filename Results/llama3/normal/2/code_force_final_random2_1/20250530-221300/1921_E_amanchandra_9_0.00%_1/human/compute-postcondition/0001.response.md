Output State: **`h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are assigned integer values from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The value of `i` remains 0, as it is not affected by the code. The stdin now contains one less test case, as one test case has been read and processed.
