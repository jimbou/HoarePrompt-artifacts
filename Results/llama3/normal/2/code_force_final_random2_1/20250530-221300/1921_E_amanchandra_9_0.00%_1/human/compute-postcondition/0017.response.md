The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and there are multiple test cases. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb are integers, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**
