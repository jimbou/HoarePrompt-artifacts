Postcondition: ***h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb are integers, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If xa > xb, 'Draw' is printed. Otherwise, x is the integer division of the absolute difference between xa and xb by 2. If the absolute difference between xa and xb is odd, either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between the maximum of 1 and yb - x and ya is less than or equal to x + 1 and the absolute difference between the minimum of w and yb + x and ya is less than or equal to x + 1. If the absolute difference between xa and xb is even, either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between the maximum of 1 and ya - x and yb is less than or equal to x and the absolute difference between the minimum of w and yb + x and yb is less than or equal to x.***
