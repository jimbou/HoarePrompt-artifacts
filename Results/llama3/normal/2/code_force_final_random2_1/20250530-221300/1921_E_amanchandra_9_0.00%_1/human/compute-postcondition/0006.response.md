Output State: **`h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers, `i` is 0, `x` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to (`xb` - `xa`) / 2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`.**

The code calculates the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`, divides it by 2, and assigns the result to `x`. Since `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`, the absolute difference is equal to `xb` - `xa`. Therefore, `x` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to (`xb` - `xa`) / 2. The values of the other variables are not affected.
