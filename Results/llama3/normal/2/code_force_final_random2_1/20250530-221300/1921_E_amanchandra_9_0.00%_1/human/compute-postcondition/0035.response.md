Output State: **h is an integer, w is an integer, xa is an integer, ya is an integer, xb is an integer, yb is an integer, i is 2, x is the integer part of the absolute difference between xa and xb divided by 2, l is the maximum of 1 and yb - x, r is the minimum of w and yb + x, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this final state, all the initial variables remain unchanged except for `l` and `r`, which are newly introduced. The value of `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`, and the value of `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`. The value of `x` is still the integer part of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1.
