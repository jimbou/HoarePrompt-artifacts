Output: **h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb are integers, i is 0, x is a non-negative integer less than or equal to (xb - xa) / 2, l is an integer equal to the maximum of 1 and yb - x, r is an integer equal to the minimum of w and yb + x, xa is less than or equal to xb, and the difference between xa and xb is an odd number, and this is printed: 'Draw' if the absolute difference between l and ya is less than or equal to x + 1 and the absolute difference between r and ya is less than or equal to x + 1, otherwise 'Alice'**
