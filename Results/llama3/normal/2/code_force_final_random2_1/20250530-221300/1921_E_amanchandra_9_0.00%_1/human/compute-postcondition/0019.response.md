Based on the initial state, the code will print the string 'Draw'.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

* The initial state mentions that `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers, but their values are not specified.
* The variable `i` is set to 1.
* The code `print('Draw')` is executed.

Since there are no variables or expressions inside the `print` statement, the output will be the literal string 'Draw'.

Output: **Draw**
