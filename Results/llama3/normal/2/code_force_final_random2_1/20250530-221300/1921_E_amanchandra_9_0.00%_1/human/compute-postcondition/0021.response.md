Output State: **`h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers, `i` is 1, `x` is the integer division of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the values of `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` remain unchanged as integers. The value of `i` is still 1. A new variable `x` is introduced, which is calculated as the integer division of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` by 2. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been processed, so it now contains one less test case.
