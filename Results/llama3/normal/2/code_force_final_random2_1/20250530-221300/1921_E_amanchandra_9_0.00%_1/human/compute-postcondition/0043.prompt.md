Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b (1 <= x_a, x_b <= h <= 10^6, 1 <= y_a, y_b <= w <= 10^9) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a != x_b or y_a != y_b.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb = map(int, input().split())
    if xa > xb:
        print('Draw')
    else:
        x = abs(xa - xb) // 2
        if abs(xa - xb) % 2:
            l = max(1, yb - x)
            r = min(w, yb + x)
            print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r -
                ya) <= x + 1])
        else:
            l = max(1, ya - x)
            r = min(w, yb + x)
            print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb are integers, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If xa is greater than xb, 'Draw' is printed. If xa is less than or equal to xb, then if the difference between xa and xb is an odd number, 'Draw' is printed if the absolute difference between l and ya is less than or equal to x + 1 and the absolute difference between r and ya is less than or equal to x + 1, otherwise 'Alice' is printed. If the difference between xa and xb is an even number, then either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between l and yb is less than or equal to x and the absolute difference between r and yb is less than or equal to x.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb are integers, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If xa > xb, 'Draw' is printed. Otherwise, x is the integer division of the absolute difference between xa and xb by 2. If the absolute difference between xa and xb is odd, either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between the maximum of 1 and yb - x and ya is less than or equal to x + 1 and the absolute difference between the minimum of w and yb + x and ya is less than or equal to x + 1. If the absolute difference between xa and xb is even, either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between the maximum of 1 and ya - x and yb is less than or equal to x and the absolute difference between the minimum of w and yb + x and yb is less than or equal to x.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb are integers, i is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If xa > xb, 'Draw' is printed. Otherwise, x is the integer part of the absolute difference between xa and xb divided by 2. If abs(xa - xb) is odd, either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed based on the conditions abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1, where l is the maximum of 1 and yb - x, and r is the minimum of w and yb + x. If abs(xa - xb) is even, either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed based on the conditions abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x, where l is the maximum of 1 and ya - x, and r is the minimum of w and yb + x.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
