Postcondition: ***h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb are integers, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If xa is greater than xb, 'Draw' is printed. If xa is less than or equal to xb, then if the difference between xa and xb is an odd number, 'Draw' is printed if the absolute difference between l and ya is less than or equal to x + 1 and the absolute difference between r and ya is less than or equal to x + 1, otherwise 'Alice' is printed. If the difference between xa and xb is an even number, then either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between l and yb is less than or equal to x and the absolute difference between r and yb is less than or equal to x.***
