The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `input()`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `input()`. If `input()` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `input()` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, `input()` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
