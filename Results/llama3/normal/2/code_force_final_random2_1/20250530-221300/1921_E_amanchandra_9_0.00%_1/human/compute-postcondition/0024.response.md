Output: **h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb are integers, i is 1, x is the integer division of the absolute difference between xa and xb by 2, l is the maximum of 1 and yb - x, r is the minimum of w and yb + x, and this is printed: either 'Draw' or 'Alice' depending on whether the absolute difference between l and ya is less than or equal to x + 1 and the absolute difference between r and ya is less than or equal to x + 1**
