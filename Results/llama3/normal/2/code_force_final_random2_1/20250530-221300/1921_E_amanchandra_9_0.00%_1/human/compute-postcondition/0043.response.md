Output State: **h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb are integers, i is equal to the number of test cases, stdin contains no test cases. If xa > xb, 'Draw' is printed. Otherwise, x is the integer part of the absolute difference between xa and xb divided by 2. If abs(xa - xb) is odd, either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed based on the conditions abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1, where l is the maximum of 1 and yb - x, and r is the minimum of w and yb + x. If abs(xa - xb) is even, either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed based on the conditions abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x, where l is the maximum of 1 and ya - x, and r is the minimum of w and yb + x.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the test cases from the standard input, and for each test case, it has printed either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The loop has iterated over all the test cases, and the standard input is now empty.
