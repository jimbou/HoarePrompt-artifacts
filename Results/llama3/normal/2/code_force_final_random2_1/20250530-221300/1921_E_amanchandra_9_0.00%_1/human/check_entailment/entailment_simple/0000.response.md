Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly determines the outcome of the game based on the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. If `xa > xb`, the program prints 'Draw' because Alice is already in a higher row than Bob, and she can't move down, so the game is a draw.

2. If `xa <= xb`, the program calculates the number of rows `x` that Alice needs to move down to reach Bob's row. If `abs(xa - xb)` is odd, it means that Alice will move down an odd number of rows, and Bob will move up an even number of rows. In this case, the program checks if Alice can reach Bob's column by moving down and diagonally. If she can, the program prints 'Alice'; otherwise, it prints 'Draw'.

3. If `abs(xa - xb)` is even, it means that Alice will move down an even number of rows, and Bob will move up an odd number of rows. In this case, the program checks if Bob can reach Alice's column by moving up and diagonally. If he can, the program prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Draw'.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
