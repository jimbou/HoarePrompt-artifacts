The code prints either 'Draw' or 'Alice' based on the conditions `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`. 

Since the values of `l`, `r`, `x`, and `ya` are not explicitly provided, we can't determine the exact output. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either 'Draw' or 'Alice'.

Output: **'Draw' or 'Alice' (where 'Draw' is printed if the absolute difference between l and ya is less than or equal to x + 1 and the absolute difference between r and ya is less than or equal to x + 1, otherwise 'Alice' is printed)**
