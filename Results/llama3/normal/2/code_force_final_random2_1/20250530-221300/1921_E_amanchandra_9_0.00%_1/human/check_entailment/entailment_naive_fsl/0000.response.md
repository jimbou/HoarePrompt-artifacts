Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when Alice's chip is in the last row (x_a = h) or Bob's chip is in the first row (x_b = 1). In these cases, the game should end in a draw, but the program does not check for these conditions.

For example, if the input is "4 1 4 1 1 1", the program will output "Alice" instead of "Draw", because it does not check if Alice's chip is in the last row.

The program only checks if the difference between the x-coordinates of the chips is even or odd, and then calculates the possible moves for the chips. However, it does not consider the boundary conditions of the board, which can lead to incorrect results in certain cases.
