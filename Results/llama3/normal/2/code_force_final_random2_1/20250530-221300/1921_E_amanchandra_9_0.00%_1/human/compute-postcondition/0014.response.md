Output: **h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb are integers, i is 0, x is a non-negative integer less than or equal to (xb - xa) / 2, l is an integer between 1 and w, r is an integer between 1 and w, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, xa is less than or equal to xb. The absolute difference between xa and xb is even, and either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between l and yb is less than or equal to x and the absolute difference between r and yb is less than or equal to x**
