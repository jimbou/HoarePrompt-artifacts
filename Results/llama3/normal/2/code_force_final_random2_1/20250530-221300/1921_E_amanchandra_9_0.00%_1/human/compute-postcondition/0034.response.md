The code calculates the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`, divides it by 2, and assigns the result to `x`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers, `i` is 2, `x` is the integer part of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**
