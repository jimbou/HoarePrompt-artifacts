Output State: **h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb are integers, i is 1, x is the integer division of the absolute difference between xa and xb by 2, l is the maximum of 1 and ya - x, r is the minimum of w and yb + x**

In this final state, the values of `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged from the initial state. The code introduces two new variables, `l` and `r`, which are calculated based on the existing variables. The value of `l` is the maximum of 1 and the difference between `ya` and `x`, while the value of `r` is the minimum of `w` and the sum of `yb` and `x`.
