Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k. For each test case, it generates a list of 21 integers, initially containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20. It then finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to k, replaces it with three new integers (k - largest_power, k + 1, and k + largest_power + 1), and prints the length and the modified list of integers. The function processes all test cases and prints the results for each case.**
