Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of at least 3 integers where each integer is a power of 2, i is incremented by 1 from its previous value, idx is i - 1.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `idx = i - 1` and `break`. The first line assigns the value of `i - 1` to `idx`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `idx` will be the previous value of `i`. The second line, `break`, does not affect any variables. 

The initial state of `n`, `k`, and `nums` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `idx` is assigned the value of `i - 1`.
