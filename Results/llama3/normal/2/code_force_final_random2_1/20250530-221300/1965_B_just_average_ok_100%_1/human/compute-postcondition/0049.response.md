Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2 except for three integers: k - nums[idx], k + 1, and k + nums[idx] + 1, idx is the index of the largest power of 2 in nums that is less than or equal to k, i is 0, stdin contains at least 20 lines each containing two integers n and k.**

In this output state, the value of `n` and `k` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The list `nums` initially contained 21 integers, each a power of 2. After the code execution, three new integers are appended to `nums`: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`. The integer `1 << idx` is removed from `nums`. The value of `idx` remains the same as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The state of `stdin` remains the same as it is not affected by the code.
