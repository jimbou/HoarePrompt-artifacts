The code prints the elements of the list `nums`. The list `nums` contains 22 integers. The 21st integer is `k - nums[20]`, the 22nd integer is `k + 1`, and the 23rd integer is `k + nums[20] + 1`. However, the integer `1 << 20` is removed from the list.

Since the exact values of `k` and `nums[20]` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd integers. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the elements of the list `nums` with the specified values.

Output: **[list of 22 integers where the 21st integer is k - nums[20], the 22nd integer is k + 1, the 23rd integer is k + nums[20] + 1, and the integer 1 << 20 is removed]**
