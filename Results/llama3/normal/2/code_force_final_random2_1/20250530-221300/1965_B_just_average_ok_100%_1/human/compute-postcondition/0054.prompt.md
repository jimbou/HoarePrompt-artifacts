Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t lines each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(21)]
    idx = -1
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] > k:
            idx = i - 1
            break
    nums.append(k - nums[idx])
    nums.append(k + 1)
    nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
    nums.remove(1 << idx)
    print(len(nums))
    print(*nums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: nums is a list of 22 integers where the 21st integer is k - nums[20], the 22nd integer is k + 1, the 23rd integer is k + nums[20] + 1, and the integer 1 << 20 is removed, i is 20, n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains t-1 lines each containing two integers n and k, and the list nums which is [nums[0], nums[1], nums[2], nums[3], nums[4], nums[5], nums[6], nums[7], nums[8], nums[9], nums[10], nums[11], nums[12], nums[13], nums[14], nums[15], nums[16], nums[17], nums[18], nums[19], k - nums[20], k + 1] is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 3 integers where the first integer is k - (k + 1), the second integer is k + 1, and the third integer is k + (k + 1) + 1, stdin contains t-20 lines each containing two integers n and k, idx is the index of the first element in nums that is greater than k, and i is 20, and the length of nums which is 3 is being printed, and the elements of the list nums are being printed: [k - (k + 1), k + 1, k + (k + 1) + 1]

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2 except for three integers: k - nums[idx], k + 1, and k + nums[idx] + 1, idx is the index of the largest power of 2 in nums that is less than or equal to k, i is 0, stdin contains at least 20 lines each containing two integers n and k, the length of the list nums which is 21 is being printed, and the list nums is printed which contains 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2 except for three integers: k - nums[idx], k + 1, and k + nums[idx] + 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
