According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `nums`. If `nums` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 20, which is the last index of the list `nums`. So for the loop to be executed, `i` must be 0 and `nums` must have at least 1 element.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, `nums` is a list of 21 integers where the 21st integer is k - nums[20], the 22nd integer is k + 1, the 23rd integer is k + nums[20] + 1, and the integer 1 << 20 is removed, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-3 lines each containing two integers n and k, and the list nums which is [nums[0], nums[1], nums[2], nums[3], nums[4], nums[5], nums[6], nums[7], nums[8], nums[9], nums[10], nums[11], nums[12], nums[13], nums[14], nums[15], nums[16], nums[17], nums[18], nums[19], k - nums[20], k + 1]**
