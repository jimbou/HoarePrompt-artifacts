To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the input from stdin and the variable `_`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head contains a call to `input()`, which reads a line from stdin.
2. The input from stdin is expected to be an integer `t`, which is used as the upper limit for the range.
3. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer (1 <= t <= 1000).
4. The variable `_` is used as the loop variable, but its value is not used in the loop body. However, its presence indicates that the loop will iterate `t` times.

Considering these points, the adjusted state is:

State: **stdin contains an integer t, where 1 <= t <= 1000, and t lines each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n)**

Note that the state of `t` is adjusted to ensure it is within the specified range, and the state of stdin is adjusted to reflect the expected input format. The variable `_` is not explicitly mentioned in the state, as its value is not relevant to the loop's execution.
