Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2, idx is the index of the largest power of 2 in nums that is less than or equal to k, i is 0, stdin contains at least 20 lines each containing two integers n and k.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `n`, `k`, and `stdin` as in the initial state. The list `nums` will still contain 21 integers, each a power of 2. The variable `idx` will be set to the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`. The variable `i` will be 0, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements in `nums`.
