Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and the final output state is determined by the last iteration of the loop. The value of the loop counter `_` is equal to `t`, the number of test cases. The variables `n` and `k` have the values of the last test case. The list `nums` contains 21 integers, where each integer is a power of 2 except for three integers: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`. The index `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`. The variable `i` has the value 20. The standard input `stdin` is empty, as all test cases have been processed. The length of the list `nums` is 21, and the list `nums` is printed with its 21 integers.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished running, and the final state is determined by the last test case. The loop counter has reached the total number of test cases `t`, and the variables `n` and `k` have the values of the last test case. The list `nums` contains 21 integers, with three of them being special values related to `k`, and the index `idx` points to the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`. The variable `i` has the value 20, indicating that the loop has finished iterating. The standard input `stdin` is empty, as all test cases have been processed, and the length and contents of the list `nums` are printed as output.
