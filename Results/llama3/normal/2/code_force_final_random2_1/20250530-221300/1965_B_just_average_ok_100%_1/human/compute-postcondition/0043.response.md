Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of at least 2 integers where each integer is a power of 2, idx is set to i - 1**

The code snippet provided does not modify the values of `n`, `k`, or `nums` as they are not directly affected by the given lines. The variable `idx` is assigned the value of `i - 1`, but since `i` is not defined within the provided code snippet, we cannot determine its exact value. However, based on the initial state, we know that `idx` is set to `i - 1` if `nums[i]` is larger than `k`, otherwise, it remains unchanged. Since the code snippet does not provide enough information to determine the exact value of `i`, we can only conclude that `idx` is set to `i - 1` without specifying its exact value.
