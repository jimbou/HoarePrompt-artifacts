Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `nums` is a list of at least 3 integers where each integer is a power of 2, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `nums[i]` is greater than `k`, then `idx` is set to `i - 1`.***
