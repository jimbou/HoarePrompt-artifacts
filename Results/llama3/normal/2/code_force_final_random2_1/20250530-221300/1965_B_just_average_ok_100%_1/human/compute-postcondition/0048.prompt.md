Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2, idx is -1, i is 21, stdin contains at least 20 lines each containing two integers n and k.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(nums)):
    if nums[i] > k:
        idx = i - 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of at least 1 integer where each integer is a power of 2, stdin contains at least 20 lines each containing two integers n and k. If nums[i] is larger than k, then idx is set to i - 1. Otherwise, no change is made to idx.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of at least 2 integers where each integer is a power of 2. If nums[i] is larger than k, idx is set to i - 1. Otherwise, idx remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `nums` is a list of at least 3 integers where each integer is a power of 2, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `nums[i]` is greater than `k`, then `idx` is set to `i - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
