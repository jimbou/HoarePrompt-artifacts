Output State: **idx is 1, i is 2, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2 that must have at least 3 integers, stdin contains t-1 lines each containing two integers n and k, n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `i - 1` to `idx`. Since `i` is 2, `idx` becomes 1. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. No other variables are modified by the code.
