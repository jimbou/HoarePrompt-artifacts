Postcondition: ***stdin contains t-1 lines each containing two integers n and k, n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2 that must have at least 3 integers, i is 2. If nums[i] is larger than k, then idx is -2. Otherwise, idx is 1.***
