Output State: **i is 1, idx is 0, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2 that must have at least 2 integers, stdin contains t-1 lines each containing two integers n and k, n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `i - 1` to `idx`. Since `i` is 1, `idx` becomes 0. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. The state of `nums`, `stdin`, `n`, and `k` remains unchanged.
