To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(nums)):`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range of the length of `nums`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive.
- `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive.
- `nums` is a list of at least 2 integers where each integer is a power of 2.
- The value of `idx` depends on the comparison between `nums[i]` and `k`, but since we're only concerned with the loop head variables, we don't need to adjust `idx`, `n`, `k`, or the contents of `nums` for the loop to execute again.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 because it's the variable in the loop head that changes with each iteration. Since `i` is used to index `nums`, and we know `nums` has at least 2 integers, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than the length of `nums`. If `nums` has at least 2 integers, and at the end of the last iteration `i` was indexing the second element (assuming 0-based indexing), then for the loop to execute again, `nums` must have at least 3 integers.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time is:
- `n` remains an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive.
- `k` remains an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive.
- `nums` must be a list of at least 3 integers where each integer is a power of 2.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `nums` is a list of at least 3 integers where each integer is a power of 2, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
