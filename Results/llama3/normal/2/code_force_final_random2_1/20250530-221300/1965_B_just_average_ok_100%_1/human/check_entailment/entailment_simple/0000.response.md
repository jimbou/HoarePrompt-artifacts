Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding a sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that there is no subsequence with a sum of k, but for all 1 ≤ v ≤ n where v ≠ k, there is a subsequence with a sum of v.

The program starts by reading the number of test cases t and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of n and k.

The program then generates a list of 21 integers, each of which is a power of 2. It finds the index idx of the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to k.

The program then appends three integers to the list: k - nums[idx], k + 1, and k + nums[idx] + 1. It removes the power of 2 at index idx from the list.

Finally, the program prints the length of the list and the list itself.

The program's logic is correct. By including k - nums[idx], k + 1, and k + nums[idx] + 1 in the list, it ensures that there is no subsequence with a sum of k. By including all powers of 2 up to the largest power of 2 less than or equal to k, it ensures that for all 1 ≤ v ≤ n where v ≠ k, there is a subsequence with a sum of v.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
