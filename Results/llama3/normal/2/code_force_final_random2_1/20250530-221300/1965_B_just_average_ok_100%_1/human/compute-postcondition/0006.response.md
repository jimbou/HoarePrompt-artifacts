The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `nums`. If `i` is less than `len(nums)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list of 21 integers. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `nums` must have at least 2 integers.
State: **stdin contains t-1 lines each containing two integers n and k, n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2 that must have at least 2 integers, i is 1. If nums[i] is larger than k, then idx is -2. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
