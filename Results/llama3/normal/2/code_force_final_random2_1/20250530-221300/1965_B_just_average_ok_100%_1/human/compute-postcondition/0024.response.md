The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `nums`. If `i` is less than `len(nums)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not defined, `nums` is a list of 21 integers where the 21st integer is k - nums[20], the 22nd integer is k + 1, the 23rd integer is k + nums[20] + 1, and the integer 1 << 20 is removed. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` is 0 and `nums` is a list of 21 integers where the 21st integer is k - nums[20], the 22nd integer is k + 1, the 23rd integer is k + nums[20] + 1, and the integer 1 << 20 is removed. If nums[0] is greater than k, then i is -1. Otherwise, no change is made.
State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where the 21st integer is k - nums[20], the 22nd integer is k + 1, the 23rd integer is k + nums[20] + 1, and the integer 1 << 20 is removed, stdin contains t-3 lines each containing two integers n and k, and the list nums which is [nums[0], nums[1], nums[2], nums[3], nums[4], nums[5], nums[6], nums[7], nums[8], nums[9], nums[10], nums[11], nums[12], nums[13], nums[14], nums[15], nums[16], nums[17], nums[18], nums[19], k - nums[20], k + 1]. If nums[0] is greater than k, then i is -1. Otherwise, i is 0**
