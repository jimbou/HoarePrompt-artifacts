Output State: **stdin contains t-1 lines each containing two integers n and k, n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2, idx is -1**

In this output state, the value of t has been reduced by 1 because one line of input has been consumed by the code. The values of n and k have been updated to the values from the first line of input. The list nums has been initialized with 21 powers of 2, from 2^0 to 2^20. The variable idx has been set to -1.
