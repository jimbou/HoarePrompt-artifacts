Output State: **nums is a list of 22 integers where the 21st integer is k - nums[20], the 22nd integer is k + 1, the 23rd integer is k + nums[20] + 1, and the integer 1 << 20 is removed, i is 20, n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains t-1 lines each containing two integers n and k.**

The code block modifies the list `nums` by appending three new integers and removing one existing integer. The 21st integer is calculated as `k - nums[20]`, the 22nd integer is `k + 1`, and the 23rd integer is `k + nums[20] + 1`. The integer `1 << 20` is removed from the list. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 20. The values of `n` and `k` are not modified by the code block. The state of `stdin` is also unchanged, containing `t-1` lines each with two integers `n` and `k`.
