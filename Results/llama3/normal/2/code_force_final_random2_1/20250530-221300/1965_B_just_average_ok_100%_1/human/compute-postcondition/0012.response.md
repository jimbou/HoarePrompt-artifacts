Output State: **stdin contains t-1 lines each containing two integers n and k, n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2 that must have at least 21 integers, i is 20. If nums[i] is larger than k, then idx is -2. Otherwise, idx is 20.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations means that the loop has iterated over the entire list of 21 integers (nums) and has found the index (idx) where the value of nums[i] is greater than k. If such an index is found, idx is set to -2. Otherwise, idx is set to 20, indicating that no such index was found. The other variables, stdin, n, and k, remain unchanged.
