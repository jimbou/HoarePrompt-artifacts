The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `nums`. If `i` is less than `len(nums)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last index of `nums`, `nums` is a list of at least 1 integer. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `nums` must have at least 2 integers.
State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of at least 2 integers where each integer is a power of 2, stdin contains at least 20 lines each containing two integers n and k, idx is set to i - 1 if nums[i] is larger than k, otherwise idx is not changed**
