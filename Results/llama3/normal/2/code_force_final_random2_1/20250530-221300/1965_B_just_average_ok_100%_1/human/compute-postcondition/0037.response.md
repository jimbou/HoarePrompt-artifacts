Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2, idx is -1, i is 21, stdin contains at least 20 lines each containing two integers n and k.**

In this final state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input from stdin, which contains at least 21 lines of two integers each. The list `nums` is now a list of 21 integers, where each integer is a power of 2, calculated using the expression `(1 << i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to 20. The variable `idx` remains unchanged at -1, and the variable `i` is still 21. The stdin now contains at least 20 lines of two integers each, as one line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
