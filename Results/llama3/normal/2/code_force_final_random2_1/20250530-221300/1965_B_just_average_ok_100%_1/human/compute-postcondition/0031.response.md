Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 3 integers where the first integer is k - (k + 1), the second integer is k + 1, and the third integer is k + (k + 1) + 1, stdin contains t-20 lines each containing two integers n and k, idx is the index of the first element in nums that is greater than k, and i is 20.**

The code modifies the list `nums` by appending three new elements and removing one element. The first line appends the value of `k - nums[idx]` to `nums`, which is equivalent to `k - (k + 1)`, since `nums[idx]` is `k + 1`. The second line appends `k + 1` to `nums`. The third line appends `k + nums[idx] + 1` to `nums`, which is equivalent to `k + (k + 1) + 1`. The fourth line removes the element at index `idx` from `nums`, which is `1 << idx`, but since `idx` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`, and `nums` only contains one element initially, `idx` is 0, and `1 << idx` is 1, which is not present in `nums`, so this line does not modify `nums`. The other variables `n`, `k`, `stdin`, and `i` are not affected by the code.
