Output State: **idx is -2, i is 0, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2 that must have at least 1 integer, stdin contains t-1 lines each containing two integers n and k, n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive**

Explanation:
The first line assigns the value of `i - 1` to `idx`. Since `i` is 0, `idx` becomes -1 - 1 = -2. The second line is a break statement, which does not affect any variables. No other variables are affected by the code.
