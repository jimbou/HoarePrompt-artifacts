The code prints the elements of the list `nums`. The list `nums` contains three integers: `k - (k + 1)`, `k + 1`, and `k + (k + 1) + 1`. Since `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, the exact values of these integers depend on the value of `k`.

Output: **k - (k + 1), k + 1, k + (k + 1) + 1 (where k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive)**
