To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `nums`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `nums` has at least one element. Since `nums` is a list of 21 integers, we can adjust its state to have at least one element.

Additionally, since `i` is the loop variable, we can adjust its state to be within the range of indices of `nums`. Since `nums` has 21 elements, the valid indices are from 0 to 20.

The other variables `n`, `k`, `idx`, and `stdin` are not directly related to the loop head, so we don't need to adjust their states.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `nums` is a list of at least 1 integer where each integer is a power of 2, `idx` is -1, `i` is between 0 and 20 inclusive, `stdin` contains at least 20 lines each containing two integers `n` and `k`**
