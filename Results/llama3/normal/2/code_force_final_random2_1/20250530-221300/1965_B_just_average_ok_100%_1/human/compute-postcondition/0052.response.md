The code prints the elements of the list `nums` which contains 21 integers. The list includes powers of 2 except for three integers: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`. Here, `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`. Since the exact values of `k` and `nums` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the three exceptions. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the list of 21 integers.

Output: **A list of 21 integers, where 18 integers are powers of 2, and three integers are k - nums[idx], k + 1, and k + nums[idx] + 1 (where k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, and idx is the index of the largest power of 2 in nums that is less than or equal to k)**
