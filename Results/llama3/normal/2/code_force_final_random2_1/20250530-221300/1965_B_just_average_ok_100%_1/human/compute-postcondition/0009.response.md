To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `nums`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `nums` has at least 2 integers. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The length of `nums` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **stdin contains t-1 lines each containing two integers n and k, n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where each integer is a power of 2 that must have at least 3 integers, i is 2. If nums[i] is larger than k, then idx is -2. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
