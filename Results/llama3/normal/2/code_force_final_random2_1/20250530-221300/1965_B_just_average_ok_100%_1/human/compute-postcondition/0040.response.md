Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of at least 1 integer where each integer is a power of 2, idx is i - 1, i is between 0 and 20 inclusive, stdin contains at least 20 lines each containing two integers n and k.**

The code assigns the value of `i - 1` to `idx`, effectively decrementing the value of `idx` by 1. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. No other variables are modified by the code. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and `stdin` still contains at least 20 lines, each with two integers `n` and `k`. The list `nums` and its elements, including `nums[i]`, remain unchanged, with each integer being a power of 2. The current value of `nums[i]` is still greater than `k`.
