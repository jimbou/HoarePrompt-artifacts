The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t` which is the input. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 1, stdin contains t-1 lines each containing two integers n and k. So for the loop to be executed one more time stdin must contain t-2 lines each containing two integers n and k.
State: **nums is a list of 22 integers where the 21st integer is k - nums[20], the 22nd integer is k + 1, the 23rd integer is k + nums[20] + 1, and the integer 1 << 20 is removed, i is 20, n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains t-2 lines each containing two integers n and k, and the list nums which is [nums[0], nums[1], nums[2], nums[3], nums[4], nums[5], nums[6], nums[7], nums[8], nums[9], nums[10], nums[11], nums[12], nums[13], nums[14], nums[15], nums[16], nums[17], nums[18], nums[19], k - nums[20], k + 1]**
