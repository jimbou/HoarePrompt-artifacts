You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t lines each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n).
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(21)]
        
        idx = -1
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        
        nums.append(k + 1)
        
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        
        print(len(nums))
        
        print(*nums)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing, and the final output state is determined by the last iteration of the loop. The value of the loop counter `_` is equal to `t`, the number of test cases. The variables `n` and `k` have the values of the last test case. The list `nums` contains 21 integers, where each integer is a power of 2 except for three integers: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`. The index `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`. The variable `i` has the value 20. The standard input `stdin` is empty, as all test cases have been processed. The length of the list `nums` is 21, and the list `nums` is printed with its 21 integers.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
