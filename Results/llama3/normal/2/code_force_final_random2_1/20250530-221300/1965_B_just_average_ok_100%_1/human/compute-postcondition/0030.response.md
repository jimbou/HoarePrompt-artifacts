Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 1 integer where the integer is k + 1, stdin contains t-20 lines each containing two integers n and k, and the list nums which is [k + 1]. idx is the index of the first element in nums that is greater than k, and i is 20.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the list `nums` will be reduced to a single element, which is `k + 1`. The variable `idx` will be the index of the first element in the original list `nums` that is greater than `k`, and the variable `i` will be 20. The other variables, `n` and `k`, will remain unchanged.
