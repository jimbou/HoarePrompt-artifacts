Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of at least 1 integer where each integer is a power of 2, stdin contains at least 20 lines each containing two integers n and k. If nums[i] is larger than k, then idx is set to i - 1. Otherwise, no change is made to idx.***
