The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 20, which means that 20 lines have been read from `stdin`. For the loop to execute again, there must be at least 21 lines in `stdin`, and the 21st line must contain two integers `n` and `k`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `nums` is a list of 3 integers where the first integer is `k` - (`k` + 1), the second integer is `k` + 1, and the third integer is `k` + (`k` + 1) + 1, `stdin` contains at least 21 lines each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `idx` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`, and `i` is 21**
