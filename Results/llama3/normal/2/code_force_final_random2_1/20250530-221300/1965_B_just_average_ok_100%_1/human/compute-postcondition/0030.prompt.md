Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where the 21st integer is k - nums[20], the 22nd integer is k + 1, the 23rd integer is k + nums[20] + 1, and the integer 1 << 20 is removed, i is 20, stdin contains t-3 lines each containing two integers n and k, and the list nums which is [nums[0], nums[1], nums[2], nums[3], nums[4], nums[5], nums[6], nums[7], nums[8], nums[9], nums[10], nums[11], nums[12], nums[13], nums[14], nums[15], nums[16], nums[17], nums[18], nums[19], k - nums[20], k + 1]
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(nums)):
    if nums[i] > k:
        idx = i - 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where the 21st integer is k - nums[20], the 22nd integer is k + 1, the 23rd integer is k + nums[20] + 1, and the integer 1 << 20 is removed, stdin contains t-3 lines each containing two integers n and k, and the list nums which is [nums[0], nums[1], nums[2], nums[3], nums[4], nums[5], nums[6], nums[7], nums[8], nums[9], nums[10], nums[11], nums[12], nums[13], nums[14], nums[15], nums[16], nums[17], nums[18], nums[19], k - nums[20], k + 1]. If nums[0] is greater than k, then i is -1. Otherwise, no change is made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 21 integers where the 21st integer is k - nums[20], the 22nd integer is k + 1, the 23rd integer is k + nums[20] + 1, and the integer 1 << 20 is removed, stdin contains t-3 lines each containing two integers n and k, and the list nums which is [nums[0], nums[1], nums[2], nums[3], nums[4], nums[5], nums[6], nums[7], nums[8], nums[9], nums[10], nums[11], nums[12], nums[13], nums[14], nums[15], nums[16], nums[17], nums[18], nums[19], k - nums[20], k + 1]. If nums[0] is greater than k, then idx is -2. Otherwise, idx is -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 20 integers where the 20th integer is k - nums[19], the 21st integer is k + 1, the 22nd integer is k + nums[19] + 1, and the integer 1 << 19 is removed, stdin contains t-4 lines each containing two integers n and k, and the list nums which is [nums[0], nums[1], nums[2], nums[3], nums[4], nums[5], nums[6], nums[7], nums[8], nums[9], nums[10], nums[11], nums[12], nums[13], nums[14], nums[15], nums[16], nums[17], nums[18], k - nums[19], k + 1]. If nums[1] is greater than k, then idx is 0 and i is 1. Otherwise, idx is -1 and i is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
