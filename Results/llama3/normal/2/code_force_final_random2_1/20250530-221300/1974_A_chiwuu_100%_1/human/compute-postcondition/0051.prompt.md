You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing two integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = input().split()
        
        a = int(a)
        
        b = int(b)
        
        t = b
        
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2
        else:
            t = t // 2 + 1
        
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1

    #State: Output State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is `n-1`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` is either `b // 2` if `b` is even or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd, and `t1` is either `15 * (b // 2) - 4 * b` if `b` is even or `15 * ((b // 2) + 1) - 4 * b` if `b` is odd. Otherwise, `t2` is `a - t1`. If `t2` is a multiple of 15, `t` is either `b // 2 + (a - (15 * (b // 2) - 4 * b)) // 15` if `b` is even or `(b // 2) + 1 + (a - (15 * ((b // 2) + 1) - 4 * b)) // 15` if `b` is odd. Otherwise, `t` is either `b // 2 + t2 // 15 + 1` if `b` is even or `(b // 2) + 1 + t2 // 15 + 1` if `b` is odd, and the value of `t` is being printed.
    #
    #In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the input lines, and the variables `a`, `b`, `t`, and `t1` have been updated according to the loop's logic. The value of `t` is being printed, which represents the result of the calculation performed by the loop for the last input line. The loop has iterated `n-1` times, where `n` is the number of input lines.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
