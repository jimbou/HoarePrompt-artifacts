Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is either `b // 2 + 1 + (a - (15 * (b // 2) - 4 * b)) // 15` if `b` is even or `(b // 2) + 1 + 1 + (a - (15 * ((b // 2) + 1) - 4 * b)) // 15` if `b` is odd, `t1` is either `15 * (b // 2) - 4 * b` if `b` is even or `15 * ((b // 2) + 1) - 4 * b` if `b` is odd, `t2` is either `a - (15 * (b // 2) - 4 * b)` if `b` is even or `a - (15 * ((b // 2) + 1) - 4 * b)` if `b` is odd.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, `i` remains 1, `a` and `b` are still integers. The value of `t` has been updated by adding 1 and the integer division of `t2` by 15. The values of `t1` and `t2` remain the same.
