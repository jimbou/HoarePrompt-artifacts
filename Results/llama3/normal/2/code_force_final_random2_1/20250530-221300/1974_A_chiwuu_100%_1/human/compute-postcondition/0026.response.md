Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is either `b // 2` if `b` is even or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd, `t1` is either `15 * (b // 2) - 4 * b` if `b` is even or `15 * ((b // 2) + 1) - 4 * b` if `b` is odd.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` remains 1, `a` remains an integer, and `b` remains an integer. The value of `t` depends on whether `b` is even or odd, and `t1` is calculated based on the value of `t` and `b`.
