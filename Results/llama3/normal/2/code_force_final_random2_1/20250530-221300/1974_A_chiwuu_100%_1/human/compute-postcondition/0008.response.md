Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is either `b / 2` if `b` is even or `(b + 2) / 2` if `b` is odd, and `t1` is `15 * t - 4 * b`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `t` is determined based on whether `b` is even or odd, and the value of `t1` is calculated using the value of `t` and `b`. Note that `t` is not odd, as specified in the initial state.
