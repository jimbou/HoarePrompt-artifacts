Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is either `b // 2` if `b` is even or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd, `t1` is either `15 * (b // 2) - 4 * b` if `b` is even or `15 * ((b // 2) + 1) - 4 * b` if `b` is odd.**

The code `t = t` does not change the value of `t`, it simply reassigns the current value of `t` to itself. Therefore, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state.
