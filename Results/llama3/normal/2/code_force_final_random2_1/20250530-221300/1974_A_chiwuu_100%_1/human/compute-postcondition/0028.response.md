Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is either `b // 2` if `b` is even or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd, `t1` is either `15 * (b // 2) - 4 * b` if `b` is even or `15 * ((b // 2) + 1) - 4 * b` if `b` is odd, `t2` is either `a - (15 * (b // 2) - 4 * b)` if `b` is even or `a - (15 * ((b // 2) + 1) - 4 * b)` if `b` is odd.**

In natural language, the output state is: `n` is still an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is still 1, `a` and `b` are still integers, `t` is still either half of `b` if `b` is even or half of `b` plus 1 if `b` is odd, `t1` is still either 15 times half of `b` minus 4 times `b` if `b` is even or 15 times half of `b` plus 1 minus 4 times `b` if `b` is odd, and `t2` is now either `a` minus 15 times half of `b` plus 4 times `b` if `b` is even or `a` minus 15 times half of `b` minus 1 plus 4 times `b` if `b` is odd.
