Output State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is `n-1`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` is either `b // 2` if `b` is even or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd, and `t1` is either `15 * (b // 2) - 4 * b` if `b` is even or `15 * ((b // 2) + 1) - 4 * b` if `b` is odd. Otherwise, `t2` is `a - t1`. If `t2` is a multiple of 15, `t` is either `b // 2 + (a - (15 * (b // 2) - 4 * b)) // 15` if `b` is even or `(b // 2) + 1 + (a - (15 * ((b // 2) + 1) - 4 * b)) // 15` if `b` is odd. Otherwise, `t` is either `b // 2 + t2 // 15 + 1` if `b` is even or `(b // 2) + 1 + t2 // 15 + 1` if `b` is odd, and the value of `t` is being printed.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop has executed `n` times, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The loop counter `i` has reached `n-1`. The variables `a` and `b` are integers. If the calculated value `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then the value of `t` is either half of `b` if `b` is even or half of `b` plus 1 if `b` is odd. Otherwise, the value of `t2` is calculated as `a` minus `t1`. If `t2` is a multiple of 15, then `t` is updated to half of `b` plus the quotient of `a` minus the product of 15 and half of `b` minus 4 times `b`, divided by 15, if `b` is even. If `b` is odd, then `t` is updated to half of `b` plus 1 plus the quotient of `a` minus the product of 15 and half of `b` plus 1 minus 4 times `b`, divided by 15. If `t2` is not a multiple of 15, then `t` is updated to half of `b` plus the quotient of `t2` divided by 15 plus 1, if `b` is even. If `b` is odd, then `t` is updated to half of `b` plus 1 plus the quotient of `t2` divided by 15 plus 1. Finally, the value of `t` is printed.
