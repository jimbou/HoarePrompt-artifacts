Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is either `b // 2 + t2 // 15 + 1` if `b` is even or `b // 2 + 1 + t2 // 15 + 1` if `b` is odd, `t1` is either `15 * (b // 2) - 4 * b` if `b` is even or `15 * (b // 2 + 1) - 4 * b` if `b` is odd, `t2` is `a - t1`.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated to include the expression `t2 // 15 + 1`, where `t2` is the difference between `a` and `t1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `t` depends on whether `b` is even or odd, and it is calculated by adding `t2 // 15 + 1` to the original value of `t`.
