Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is either `b // 2 + (a - (15 * (b // 2) - 4 * b)) // 15` if `b` is even or `b // 2 + 1 + (a - (15 * (b // 2 + 1) - 4 * b)) // 15` if `b` is odd, `t1` is either `15 * (b // 2) - 4 * b` if `b` is even or `15 * (b // 2 + 1) - 4 * b` if `b` is odd, `t2` is `a - t1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `n` remains an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` remains 2, `a` and `b` remain integers. The value of `t` is updated by adding the integer division of `t2` by 15 to its previous value. The values of `t1` and `t2` remain the same as their initial values, which depend on whether `b` is even or odd.
