The code `t = t // 2` divides the current value of `t` by 2 and assigns the result back to `t`. Since the current value of `t` is even (i.e., `t % 2 == 0`), the result of the division will be an integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is equal to `b` divided by 2, and the current value of `t` is an integer.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` has been halved, and it is now an integer. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
