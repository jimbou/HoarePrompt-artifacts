The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` is either `b // 2` if `b` is even or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd, and `t1` is either `15 * (b // 2) - 4 * b` if `b` is even or `15 * ((b // 2) + 1) - 4 * b` if `b` is odd. Otherwise, `t` is either `b // 2 + (a - (15 * (b // 2) - 4 * b)) // 15` if `b` is even or `(b // 2) + 1 + (a - (15 * ((b // 2) + 1) - 4 * b)) // 15` if `b` is odd, if `t2` is divisible by 15. Otherwise, `t` is either `b // 2 + 1 + (a - (15 * (b // 2) - 4 * b)) // 15` if `b` is even or `(b // 2) + 1 + 1 + (a - (15 * ((b // 2) + 1) - 4 * b)) // 15` if `b` is odd. In both cases, `t1` is either `15 * (b // 2) - 4 * b` if `b` is even or `15 * ((b // 2) + 1) - 4 * b` if `b` is odd, and `t2` is either `a - (15 * (b // 2) - 4 * b)` if `b` is even or `a - (15 * ((b // 2) + 1) - 4 * b)` if `b` is odd, and the value of `t` is being printed.**
