Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of screens needed to place application icons on a desktop. The desktop consists of screens with a grid size of 5x3, and there are two types of icons: 1x1 and 2x2.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases (n) and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 icons (a) and 2x2 icons (b).
3. It calculates the minimum number of screens needed to accommodate the 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, it calculates the number of screens needed as `b // 2` (integer division) if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd. This is because a single 2x2 icon can occupy a screen with 4 cells, and if there's an odd number of 2x2 icons, an additional screen is needed.
4. It calculates the remaining cells available on the screens allocated for 2x2 icons. Since each screen has 15 cells, it calculates the remaining cells as `t * 15 - b * 4`, where `t` is the number of screens allocated for 2x2 icons.
5. If the remaining cells are sufficient to accommodate the 1x1 icons (i.e., `t1 >= a`), it doesn't allocate any additional screens.
6. If the remaining cells are not sufficient, it calculates the additional screens needed to accommodate the 1x1 icons. It does this by subtracting the remaining cells from the total number of 1x1 icons (`a - t1`) and then dividing the result by 15 (the number of cells per screen). If the result is not a multiple of 15, it adds 1 to the result to account for the additional screen needed.
7. Finally, it prints the total number of screens needed, which is the sum of the screens allocated for 2x2 icons and the additional screens allocated for 1x1 icons.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
