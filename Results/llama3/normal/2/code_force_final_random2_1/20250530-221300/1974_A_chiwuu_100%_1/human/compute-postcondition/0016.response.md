Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is either `b / 2` if `b` is even or `(b + 2) / 2` if `b` is odd, `t1` is `15 * t - 4 * b`, `t1` is less than `a`, and `t2` is `a - t1` which is `a - (15 * t - 4 * b)` which is `a - (15 * (b / 2) - 4 * b)` if `b` is even or `a - (15 * ((b + 2) / 2) - 4 * b)` if `b` is odd. Additionally, `t2` is not divisible by 15, and `t` is now `t + t2 // 15 + 1`**.

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `t` has been updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `t1`, and `t2` remain the same as in the initial state.
