Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, a is an integer, b is an integer, t is b**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line reads two space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`, respectively. The second line converts the values of `a` and `b` to integers. The third line assigns the value of `b` to `t`.

The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a` is an integer, and `b` is an integer. The code does not modify the values of `n` and `i`, so they remain unchanged.

The values of `a` and `b` are updated by the first line of the code, which reads new values from the input. The second line converts these values to integers, but this does not change their values. The third line assigns the value of `b` to `t`, so `t` becomes equal to `b`.

Therefore, the final output state is that `n` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and `t` is equal to `b`.
