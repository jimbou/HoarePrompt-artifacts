Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is either `b / 2` if `b` is even or `(b + 2) / 2` if `b` is odd, and `t1` is `15 * t - 4 * b`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, the current value of `t1` is maintained. Otherwise, `t` is updated to either `(b / 2) + (a - (15 * (b / 2) - 4 * b)) // 15` if `b` is even or `((b + 2) / 2) + (a - (15 * ((b + 2) / 2) - 4 * b)) // 15` if `b` is odd, and `t1` is updated to `a - t1` which is `a - (15 * t - 4 * b)`. If `t2` is divisible by 15, then `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.**
