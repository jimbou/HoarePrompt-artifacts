Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is equal to `(b + 2) / 2` and `t` is not odd.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated to `(b + 2) / 2`, which is not odd because it is the result of an integer division of an odd number `b` plus 2, divided by 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
