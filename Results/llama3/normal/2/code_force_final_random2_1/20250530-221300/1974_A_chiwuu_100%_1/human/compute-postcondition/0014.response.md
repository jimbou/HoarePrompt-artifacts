Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is either `(b / 2) + (a - (15 * (b / 2) - 4 * b)) // 15` if `b` is even or `((b + 2) / 2) + (a - (15 * ((b + 2) / 2) - 4 * b)) // 15` if `b` is odd, `t1` is `15 * t - 4 * b`, `t1` is less than `a`, and `t2` is `a - t1` which is `a - (15 * t - 4 * b)`**.

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated by adding the integer division of `t2` by 15 to its previous value. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `t1` is still less than `a`, and `t2` is still equal to `a - t1`. The new value of `t` is a combination of its previous value and the updated value of `t2`.
