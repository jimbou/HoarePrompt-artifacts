Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is either `b // 2` if `b` is even or `b // 2 + 1` if `b` is odd, `t1` is either `15 * (b // 2) - 4 * b` if `b` is even or `15 * (b // 2 + 1) - 4 * b` if `b` is odd.**

In this output state, the value of `t1` is calculated based on the value of `t`, which depends on whether `b` is even or odd. If `b` is even, `t` is `b // 2` and `t1` is `15 * (b // 2) - 4 * b`. If `b` is odd, `t` is `b // 2 + 1` and `t1` is `15 * (b // 2 + 1) - 4 * b`. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
