Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is either `b // 2` if `b` is even or `b // 2 + 1` if `b` is odd, `t1` is either `15 * (b // 2) - 4 * b` if `b` is even or `15 * (b // 2 + 1) - 4 * b` if `b` is odd.**

The code `t = t` does not change the value of `t`, so the output state remains the same as the initial state. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `t1` are not affected by this code.
