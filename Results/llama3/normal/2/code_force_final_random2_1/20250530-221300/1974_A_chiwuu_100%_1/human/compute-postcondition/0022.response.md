Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, a is an integer, b is an integer, t is equal to b.**

The code snippet first reads two space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`, respectively. This means that the values of `a` and `b` are updated to the input values. The third line assigns the value of `b` to `t`, effectively making `t` equal to `b`. 

Note that the initial values of `a` and `b` are not used in the calculation, as they are overwritten by the input values. The value of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code snippet. The value of `t1` is not updated, as it is not modified by the code snippet.
