Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, a is an integer, b is an integer, t is equal to b**

The code first reads two values from the input, assigns them to `a` and `b`, and then converts these values to integers. The last line assigns the value of `b` to `t`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
