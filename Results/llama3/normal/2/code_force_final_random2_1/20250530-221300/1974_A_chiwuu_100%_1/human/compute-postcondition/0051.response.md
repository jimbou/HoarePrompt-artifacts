Functionality: **This function reads a series of input lines, where each line contains two integers, and calculates a result based on these integers. The calculation involves checking if a derived value is greater than or equal to the first integer, and if so, the result is either half of the second integer (rounded up if necessary) or half of the second integer plus one. If the derived value is less than the first integer, the function calculates a difference and adds a multiple of 15 (plus one if necessary) to the result. The function prints the calculated result for each input line.**
