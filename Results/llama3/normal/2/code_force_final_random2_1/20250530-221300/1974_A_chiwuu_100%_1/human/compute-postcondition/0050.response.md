Output State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is `n-1`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` is either `b // 2` if `b` is even or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd, and `t1` is either `15 * (b // 2) - 4 * b` if `b` is even or `15 * ((b // 2) + 1) - 4 * b` if `b` is odd. Otherwise, `t2` is `a - t1`. If `t2` is a multiple of 15, `t` is either `b // 2 + (a - (15 * (b // 2) - 4 * b)) // 15` if `b` is even or `(b // 2) + 1 + (a - (15 * ((b // 2) + 1) - 4 * b)) // 15` if `b` is odd. Otherwise, `t` is either `b // 2 + t2 // 15 + 1` if `b` is even or `(b // 2) + 1 + t2 // 15 + 1` if `b` is odd, and the value of `t` is being printed.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the input lines, and the variables `a`, `b`, `t`, and `t1` have been updated according to the loop's logic. The value of `t` is being printed, which represents the result of the calculation performed by the loop for the last input line. The loop has iterated `n-1` times, where `n` is the number of input lines.
