Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is either `b // 2 + (a - (15 * (b // 2) - 4 * b)) // 15` if `b` is even or `(b // 2) + 1 + (a - (15 * ((b // 2) + 1) - 4 * b)) // 15` if `b` is odd, `t1` is either `15 * (b // 2) - 4 * b` if `b` is even or `15 * ((b // 2) + 1) - 4 * b` if `b` is odd, `t2` is either `a - (15 * (b // 2) - 4 * b)` if `b` is even or `a - (15 * ((b // 2) + 1) - 4 * b)` if `b` is odd.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated by adding `t2 // 15` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t` is now dependent on whether `b` is even or odd, and it is calculated using the updated expression.
