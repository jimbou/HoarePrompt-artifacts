The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is either `b / 2` if `b` is even or `(b + 2) / 2` if `b` is odd, and `t1` is `15 * t - 4 * b`.**
