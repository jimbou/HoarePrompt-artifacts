Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is `b // 2 + 1`**.

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated to be the result of the expression `b // 2 + 1`, which is equivalent to the ceiling of half of `b`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
