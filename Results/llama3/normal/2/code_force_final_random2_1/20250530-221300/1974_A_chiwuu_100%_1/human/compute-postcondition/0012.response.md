Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is either `b / 2` if `b` is even or `(b + 2) / 2` if `b` is odd, `t1` is `15 * t - 4 * b`, `t1` is less than `a`, and `t2` is `a - t1` which is `a - (15 * t - 4 * b)` which is `a - (15 * (b / 2) - 4 * b)` if `b` is even or `a - (15 * ((b + 2) / 2) - 4 * b)` if `b` is odd.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `t2` which is calculated as the difference between `a` and `t1`. The value of `t2` depends on whether `b` is even or odd, and is expressed in terms of `a`, `b`, and `t`.
