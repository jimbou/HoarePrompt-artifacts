Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, list0 is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, count is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains T - 1 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x - 1):
    num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
    if num == 1:
        count += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is at least 2, y is 0, list0 is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, stdin contains T - 1 test cases, i is 0, and either count is 1 and the current value of num is 1, or count is 0 and the current value of num is not 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: T is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is at least 3, y is 0, list0 is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, stdin contains T - 1 test cases, i is 1, and either count is 2 and the current value of num is list0[2] - list0[1] - 1 if num was 1, otherwise count is 1 and the current value of num is list0[2] - list0[1] - 1 or count is 0 and the current value of num is list0[2] - list0[1] - 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: T is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is at least 3, y is 0, list0 is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, stdin contains T - 1 test cases, i is 2. If num was 1, count is either 3 and the current value of num is list0[2] - list0[1] - 1 if count was 2, otherwise count is 2 and the current value of num is list0[2] - list0[1] - 1 or count is 1 and the current value of num is list0[2] - list0[1] - 1, and num is list0[3] - list0[2] - 1. If num was not 1, count is either 2 and the current value of num is list0[2] - list0[1] - 1 if num was 1, otherwise count is 1 and the current value of num is list0[2] - list0[1] - 1 or count is 0 and the current value of num is list0[2] - list0[1] - 1, and num is list0[3] - list0[2] - 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
