Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, list0 is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, stdin contains T - 3 test cases, i is x - 1, num is list0[x] - list0[x-1] - 1, and count is either the number of times num is 1 for all pairs of adjacent elements in list0, plus 3, which is equal to n - list0[-1] + 2 if num is 1, or the number of times num is 1 for all pairs of adjacent elements in list0, plus 2, which is equal to n - list0[-1] + 1 if num is not 1.**

In this output state, the value of count has been incremented by 1. If num is 1, count is now the number of times num is 1 for all pairs of adjacent elements in list0, plus 3, which is equal to n - list0[-1] + 2. Otherwise, count is now the number of times num is 1 for all pairs of adjacent elements in list0, plus 2, which is equal to n - list0[-1] + 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
