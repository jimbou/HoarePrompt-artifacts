Postcondition: **T is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is a positive integer, list0 is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, stdin contains T - 3 test cases, i is x - 1, and the current value of num is 1, which means n - list0[-1] equals 1.**
