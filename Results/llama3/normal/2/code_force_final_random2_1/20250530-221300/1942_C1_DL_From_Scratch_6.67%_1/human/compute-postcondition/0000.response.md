Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, where n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), and y is 0. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.**

In this output state, the value of `T` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, which represents the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, where n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), and y is 0. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.
