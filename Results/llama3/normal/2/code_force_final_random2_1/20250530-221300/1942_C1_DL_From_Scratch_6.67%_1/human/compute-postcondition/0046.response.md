Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is a positive integer, list0 is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, stdin contains T - 3 test cases, i is -1, count is 0, and num is equal to n - list0[-1].**

The code block reads two lines from stdin, assigning the values to `n`, `x`, and `y`. The first line assigns the value of `n`, `x`, and `y` from stdin, making `y` a positive integer. The second line assigns a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` to `list0` and sorts it. The third line initializes `count` to 0. 

The value of `T` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `num` is not explicitly modified by the code, but its value can be determined as `n - list0[-1]`. The value of `count` is initialized to 0. The value of `stdin` is reduced by 2 test cases.
