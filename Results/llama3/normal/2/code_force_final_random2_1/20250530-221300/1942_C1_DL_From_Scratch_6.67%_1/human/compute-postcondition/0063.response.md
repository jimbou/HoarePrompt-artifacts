Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is a positive integer, `list0` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `stdin` contains `T - 3` test cases, `i` is `x - 1`, `num` is 1, `n - list0[-1]` equals 1, and `count` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of count has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged, with T being a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, n being a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x being a positive integer between 2 and the minimum of n and 2 * 10^5, y being a positive integer, list0 being a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, stdin containing T - 3 test cases, i being x - 1, num being 1, and n - list0[-1] still equal to 1.
