The code prints the sum of count and x - 2. Where count is the number of times n - list0[-1] equals 1, and x is the number of distinct integers in the sorted list list0.

Output: **count (where count is the number of times n - list0[-1] equals 1) + x - 2 (where x is the number of distinct integers in the sorted list list0) - 2**
