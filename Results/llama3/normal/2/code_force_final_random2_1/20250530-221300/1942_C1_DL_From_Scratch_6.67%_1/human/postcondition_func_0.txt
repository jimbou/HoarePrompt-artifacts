This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, where n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), and y is 0. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function then sorts these integers, counts the number of times the difference between consecutive integers is 1, and adds the number of distinct integers minus 2. Finally, it prints this count for each test case.
