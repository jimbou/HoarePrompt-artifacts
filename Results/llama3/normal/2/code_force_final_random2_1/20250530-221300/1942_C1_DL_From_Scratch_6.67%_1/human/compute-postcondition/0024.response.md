Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, list0 is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, stdin contains T - 3 test cases, i is x - 1, and count is the number of times num is 1 for all pairs of adjacent elements in list0, plus 1 if the current value of num is 1, which is equal to n - list0[-1]**
