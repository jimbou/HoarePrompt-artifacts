Postcondition: **T is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is at least 3, y is 0, list0 is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, stdin contains T - 1 test cases, i is 2. If num was 1, count is either 3 and the current value of num is list0[2] - list0[1] - 1 if count was 2, otherwise count is 2 and the current value of num is list0[2] - list0[1] - 1 or count is 1 and the current value of num is list0[2] - list0[1] - 1, and num is list0[3] - list0[2] - 1. If num was not 1, count is either 2 and the current value of num is list0[2] - list0[1] - 1 if num was 1, otherwise count is 1 and the current value of num is list0[2] - list0[1] - 1 or count is 0 and the current value of num is list0[2] - list0[1] - 1, and num is list0[3] - list0[2] - 1.**
