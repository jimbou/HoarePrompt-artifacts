Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is a positive integer, list0 is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, stdin contains T - 3 test cases, i is x - 1, and num is equal to n - list0[-1].**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of T, n, x, y, list0, stdin, and i remains the same as in the initial state. The value of num is updated to be equal to n - list0[-1], where list0[-1] is the last element of the sorted list list0.
