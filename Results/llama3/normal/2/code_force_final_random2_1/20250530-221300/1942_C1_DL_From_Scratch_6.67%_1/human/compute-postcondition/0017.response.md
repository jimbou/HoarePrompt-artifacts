Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, list0 is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, stdin contains T - 1 test cases, i is x - 1, count is the number of times num is 1 for all pairs of adjacent elements in list0, and num is n - list0[-1].**

In this output state, the value of `num` is calculated as `n - list0[-1]`, where `list0[-1]` is the last element of the sorted list `list0`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains `T - 1` test cases.
