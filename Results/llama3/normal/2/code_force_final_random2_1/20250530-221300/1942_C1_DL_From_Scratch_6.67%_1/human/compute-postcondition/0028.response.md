Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is 0, `list0` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `stdin` contains `T - 3` test cases, `i` is `x - 1`, `count` is the number of times `num` is 1 for all pairs of adjacent elements in `list0`, plus 2 if the current value of `num` is 1, which is equal to `n - list0[-1] + 1`, and the current value of `num` is 1, which is equal to `list0[x] - list0[x-1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `count` has been incremented by 1. The value of `count` now includes the additional case where the current value of `num` is 1, which is equal to `n - list0[-1] + 1`, and the current value of `num` is 1, which is equal to `list0[x] - list0[x-1]`.
