Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, list0 is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, count is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains T - 1 test cases.**

The code executes the following operations:

1. It reads the first line of the test case from stdin, which contains three integers: n, x, and y. It assigns these values to the variables n, x, and y, respectively. The value of y is 0.

2. It reads the second line of the test case from stdin, which contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. It assigns these values to the list list0.

3. It sorts the list list0 in ascending order.

4. It initializes the variable count to 0.

5. The variable _ is not affected by the code and remains 1.

6. After processing one test case, there are T - 1 test cases remaining in stdin.
