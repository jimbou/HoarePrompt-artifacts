Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, list0 is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, stdin contains T - 3 test cases, i is x - 2, count is the number of times num is 1 for all pairs of adjacent elements in list0, plus 2 if the current value of num is 1, which is equal to n - list0[-1] + 1, and num is list0[x-1] - list0[x-2] - 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: T is still a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, n is still a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is still a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to the minimum of n and 2 * 10^5, y is still 0, list0 is still a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, stdin still contains T - 3 test cases, i is still x - 2, and count has been incremented by 1. The value of count is now the number of times num is 1 for all pairs of adjacent elements in list0, plus 2 if the current value of num is 1, which is equal to n - list0[-1] + 1. The value of num is still list0[x-1] - list0[x-2] - 1.
