To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `x - 1`. Since `i` is 1, we can increment it by 1 to make it 2. Now, for the loop to execute again, `x` must be greater than 2.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is a positive integer, `list0` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `stdin` contains `T - 3` test cases, `i` is 2, `num` is equal to `list0[2] - list0[1] - 1`. If `num` is 1, then `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` is increased by 1.**
