Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is at least 2, y is 0, list0 is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, count is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains T - 1 test cases, i is 0, num is a non-negative integer**.

In this output state, the value of `num` is calculated as the difference between the second element of `list0` and the first element of `list0`, minus 1. Since `list0` is a sorted list of distinct integers from 1 to n, the difference between any two consecutive elements is at least 1, and therefore `num` is a non-negative integer. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
