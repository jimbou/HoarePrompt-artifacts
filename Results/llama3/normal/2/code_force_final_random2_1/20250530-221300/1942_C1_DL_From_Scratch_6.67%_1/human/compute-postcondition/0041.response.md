Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, list0 is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, stdin contains T - 3 test cases, i is -1, count is the number of times num is 1 for all pairs of adjacent elements in list0, plus x, which is equal to n - list0[-1] + x - 1, and the current value of num is 1, which is equal to n - list0[-1].**

In natural language, the output state is: T is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, list0 is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, stdin contains T - 3 test cases, i is -1, count is increased by 1 and is now equal to the number of times num is 1 for all pairs of adjacent elements in list0, plus x, which is equal to n - list0[-1] + x - 1, and the current value of num is still 1, which is equal to n - list0[-1].
