Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is a positive integer, `list0` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `stdin` contains `T - 3` test cases, `i` is 0, `count` is 0, and `num` is equal to `list0[1] - list0[0] - 1`**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to be equal to the difference between the second element of `list0` and the first element of `list0`, minus 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
