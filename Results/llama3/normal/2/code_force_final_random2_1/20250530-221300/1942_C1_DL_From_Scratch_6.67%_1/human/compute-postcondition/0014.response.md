Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is at least 3, y is 0, list0 is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, stdin contains T - 1 test cases, i is 2, count is either 3 and the current value of num is list0[2] - list0[1] - 1 if count was 2, otherwise count is 2 and the current value of num is list0[2] - list0[1] - 1 or count is 1 and the current value of num is list0[2] - list0[1] - 1, and num is list0[3] - list0[2] - 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of count has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of count can be either 3, 2 or 1. If count was 2, it is now 3 and the current value of num is list0[2] - list0[1] - 1. If count was 1, it is now 2 and the current value of num is list0[2] - list0[1] - 1. If count was 0, it is now 1 and the current value of num is list0[2] - list0[1] - 1.
