Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is a positive integer, `list0` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `stdin` contains `T - 3` test cases, `i` is 2, `num` is equal to `list0[3] - list0[2] - 1`. If `num` is 1, then `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `T`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `list0` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `i` is still 2. The value of `num` is updated to be the difference between the third and second elements of `list0` minus 1. The value of `count` depends on the new value of `num`: if `num` is 1, then `count` is 2; otherwise, `count` is increased by 1. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same, `T - 3`.
