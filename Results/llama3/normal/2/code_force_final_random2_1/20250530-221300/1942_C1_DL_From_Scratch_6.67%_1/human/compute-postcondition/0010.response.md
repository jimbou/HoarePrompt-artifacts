Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is at least 3, y is 0, list0 is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, stdin contains T - 1 test cases, i is 1, and count is 2 and the current value of num is list0[2] - list0[1] - 1.**

In this output state, the value of count has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of num is still list0[2] - list0[1] - 1, as it was not affected by the code.
