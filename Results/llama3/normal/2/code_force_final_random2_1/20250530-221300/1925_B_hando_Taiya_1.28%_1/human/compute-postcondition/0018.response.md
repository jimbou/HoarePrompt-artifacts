Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is increased by 1 and it must be less than or equal to the square root of `x`, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `x` still being a positive integer, `n` still being a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, and `stdin` still containing multiple test cases minus one. The value of `i` is still increased by 1 and is still less than or equal to the square root of `x`.
