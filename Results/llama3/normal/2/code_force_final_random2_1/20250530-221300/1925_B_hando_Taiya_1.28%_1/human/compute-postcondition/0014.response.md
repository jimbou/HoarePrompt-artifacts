Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is increased by 1 and it must be less than or equal to the square root of `x`. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`.***
