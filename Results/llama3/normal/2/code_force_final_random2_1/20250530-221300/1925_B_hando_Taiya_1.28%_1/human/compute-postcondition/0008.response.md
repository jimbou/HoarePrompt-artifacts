Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, `ans` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1, the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`, and `n` is larger than `x // i`. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, then `ans` is set to `x // i`.***
