Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is equal to the square root of `x` plus one, `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is such that `x` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop. The variable `i` has reached the end of its range, which is the square root of `x` plus one. The variable `ans` has been updated to store the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`. This means that `ans` now holds the largest factor of `x` that does not exceed `n`.
