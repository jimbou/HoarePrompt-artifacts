The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some positive integer, `x` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and it must be less than or equal to the square root of `x`. Therefore, `i` is increased by 1 and `x` remains the same.
State: **`x` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is increased by 1 and it must be less than or equal to the square root of `x`.**
