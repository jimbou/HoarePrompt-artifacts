Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is increased by 1 and it must be less than or equal to the square root of `x`. `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `n` is still a positive integer less than or equal to `x`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
