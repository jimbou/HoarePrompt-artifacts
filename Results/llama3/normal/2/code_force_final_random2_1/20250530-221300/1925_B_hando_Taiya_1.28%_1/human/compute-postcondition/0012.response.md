The code `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. Since `i` is increased by 1 and must be less than or equal to the square root of `x`, we can conclude that `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and a value that is at most the square root of `x`.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and a value that is at most the square root of `x`, `i` is increased by 1 and is less than or equal to the square root of `x`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one.**
