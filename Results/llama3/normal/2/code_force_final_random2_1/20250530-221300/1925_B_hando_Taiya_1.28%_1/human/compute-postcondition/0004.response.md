The code `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. Since `ans` is initially 0 and `i` is 1, the value of `ans` will be updated to 1.

The other variables are not affected by this code. The value of `x` is still a positive integer, `n` is still a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, and `i` is still 1. The current value of `x` is still divisible by `i`, and the current value of `n` is still less than or equal to the integer division of `x` by `i`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, `ans` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`, and the current value of `n` is less than or equal to the integer division of `x` by `i`.**
