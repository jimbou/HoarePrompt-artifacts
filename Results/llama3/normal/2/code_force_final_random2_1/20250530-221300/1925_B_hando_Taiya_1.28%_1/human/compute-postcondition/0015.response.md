Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is increased by 1 and it must be less than or equal to the square root of `x`. `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and a value that is at most the square root of `x` if `n` is larger than `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`***
