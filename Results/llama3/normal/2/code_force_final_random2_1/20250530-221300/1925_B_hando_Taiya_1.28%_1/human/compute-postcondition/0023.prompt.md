Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is a positive integer, n is a positive integer less than or equal to x, ans is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
    if x % i == 0:
        if n <= x // i:
            ans = max(ans, i)
        elif n <= i:
            ans = max(ans, x // i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then if `n` is less than or equal to the integer division of `x` by `i`, `ans` is 1. If `n` is larger than `x // i`, then if `n` is less than or equal to `i`, `ans` is set to `x // i`, otherwise `ans` is 0. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is increased by 1 and it must be less than or equal to the square root of `x`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and a value that is at most the square root of `x` if `n` is larger than `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is increased by 1 and it must be less than or equal to the square root of `x`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `i`. Otherwise, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and a value that is at most the square root of `x` if `n` is larger than `x // i`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
