The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1 and it must be less than or equal to the square root of `x`. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` must be increased by 1 and it must be less than or equal to the square root of `x`.
State: **`x` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is increased by 1 and it must be less than or equal to the square root of `x`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and a value that is at most the square root of `x` if `n` is larger than `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`.**
