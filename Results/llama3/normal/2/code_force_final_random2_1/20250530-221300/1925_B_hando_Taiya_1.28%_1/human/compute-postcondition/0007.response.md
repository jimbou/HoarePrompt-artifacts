The value of `ans` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `x // i`. Since `x` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`, we can calculate the new value of `ans`.

The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`, which means `x // i` is an integer. Since `n` is larger than `x // i` and `n` is less than or equal to `i`, we know that `x // i` is less than or equal to `n`.

Therefore, the new value of `ans` is the maximum of its current value (0) and `x // i`, which is `x // i`.

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, `ans` is `x // i`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`, and `n` is larger than `x // i`, and the current value of `n` is less than or equal to `i`.**
