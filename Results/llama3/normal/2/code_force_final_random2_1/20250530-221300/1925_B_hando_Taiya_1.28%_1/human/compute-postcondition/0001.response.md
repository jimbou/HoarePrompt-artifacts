To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `x` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `x` is a positive integer, which already satisfies this condition. However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to ensure it starts from 1.

State: **`x` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, `ans` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1**
