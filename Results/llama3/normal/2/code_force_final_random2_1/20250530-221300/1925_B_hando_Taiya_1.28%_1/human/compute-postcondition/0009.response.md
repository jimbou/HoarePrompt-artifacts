Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `n` is less than or equal to the integer division of `x` by `i`, then `ans` is 1. If `n` is larger than `x // i`, then if `n` is less than or equal to `i`, `ans` is set to `x // i`, otherwise `ans` is 0.***
