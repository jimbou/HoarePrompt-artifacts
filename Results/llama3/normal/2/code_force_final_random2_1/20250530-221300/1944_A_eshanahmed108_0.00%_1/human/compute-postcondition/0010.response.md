The code prints the value of `n` if the difference between `n` and `k` is less than or equal to 1, otherwise it prints 1. Since `n` and `k` are integers and their values are not explicitly provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either the value of `n` or 1.

Output: **n if n - k <= 1, otherwise 1 (where n and k are the first and second integers in the stdin, respectively)**
