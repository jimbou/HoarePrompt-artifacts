Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, stdin contains no input**.

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are integers because the `map(int, input().split())` function converts the input into integers. The stdin initially contained an integer `t` that was greater than 0, but after the execution of the code, the stdin is empty because the input has been consumed by the `input().split()` function.
