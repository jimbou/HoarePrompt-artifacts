Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `n` is equal to the first integer in the stdin and `k` is equal to the second integer in the stdin, stdin is empty, and this is printed: `n` if `n` is less than or equal to `k + 1` otherwise 1**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` have been updated to the two integers from the stdin, and the stdin is now empty. The print statement still depends on the values of `n` and `k`, but now `n` and `k` have specific values equal to the two integers from the stdin.
