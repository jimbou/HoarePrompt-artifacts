Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k. For each test case, it prints the value of n if n is less than or equal to k + 1, otherwise it prints 1. The function continues to read and process test cases until all input has been consumed from standard input, leaving it empty.**
