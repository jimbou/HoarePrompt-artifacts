State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 and greater than 1, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, `max` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` if the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is greater than the previous value of `max`, otherwise `max` remains 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `i` is 2**
