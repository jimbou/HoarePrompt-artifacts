Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 and greater than 2, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 3, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If the minimum of `a[3]` and `a[2]` is greater than the current `max`, then `max` is updated to the minimum of `a[3]` and `a[2]`. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.***
