Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, max is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `_` also remains 0 as it is not used or modified in the code. The value of `n` is updated to be an integer between 2 and 10^5, as it is assigned the value of the first line of each test case. The value of `a` is updated to be a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, as it is assigned the value of the second line of each test case. The value of `max` is initialized to 0 and remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The stdin now contains `t-1` test cases, as one test case has been processed by the code.
