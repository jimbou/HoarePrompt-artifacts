Postcondition: ***_ is 2, t is an integer between 3 and 500, n is an integer at least 2, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, if the minimum value between the i-th and (i-1)th elements of a is greater than max, then max is updated to this minimum value, otherwise max remains 0, i is at least 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases.***
