Postcondition: **_ is 2, t is an integer between 3 and 500, n is an integer at least 2, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, max is 0, i is at least 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases. The current value of max is still 0. The current value of i is at least 1. The minimum value between the i-th and (i-1)th elements of a is greater than the current value of max.**
