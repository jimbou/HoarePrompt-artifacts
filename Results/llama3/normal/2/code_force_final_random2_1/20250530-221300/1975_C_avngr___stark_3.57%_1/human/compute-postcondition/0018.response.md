The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, i is n-1 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 and i is now 1. 
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, `max` is 0, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1**
