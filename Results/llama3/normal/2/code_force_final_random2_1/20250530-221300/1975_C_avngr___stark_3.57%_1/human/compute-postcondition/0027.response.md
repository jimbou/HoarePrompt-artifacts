Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 500, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. If the minimum of `a[3]` and `a[2]` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to the minimum of `a[3]` and `a[2]`. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.***
