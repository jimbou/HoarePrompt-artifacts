Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 500, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, max is 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is n-1**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 2 and 500. The value of `_` also remains unchanged, still 1. The value of `n` is updated to a new integer between 2 and 10^5, which is read from the input. The list `a` is updated to a new list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, which are also read from the input. The value of `max` is reset to 0. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 2, now containing `t-3` test cases. The value of `i` is updated to `n-1`.
