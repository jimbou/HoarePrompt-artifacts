Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 and greater than 2, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 3, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `max` is the minimum of `a[3]` and `a[2]`.**

In this output state, the value of `max` has been updated to be the minimum of `a[3]` and `a[2]`, which are the third and second elements of the list `a`, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
