The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 500. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`_` is 2, t is an integer between 3 and 500, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, max is the maximum of the minimum of adjacent pairs of elements in a, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is n-1**
