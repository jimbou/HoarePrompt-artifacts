Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `max` is the minimum of `a[3]` and `a[2]`.**

In this output state, the value of `max` is updated to be the minimum of `a[3]` and `a[2]`, which are the 4th and 3rd elements of the list `a`, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
