Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 and greater than 1, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, `max` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `i` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `max` has been updated to be the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`, which means it now holds the smaller value between the current element and the previous element in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t-1` test cases.
