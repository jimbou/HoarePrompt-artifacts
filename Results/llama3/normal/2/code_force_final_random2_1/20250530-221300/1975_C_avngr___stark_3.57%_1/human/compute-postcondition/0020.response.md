Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, `max` is the minimum value between the current element of `a` at index `i` and the previous element of `a` at index `i-1`, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1.**

In this output state, the value of `max` has been updated to be the minimum value between the current element of `a` at index `i` and the previous element of `a` at index `i-1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The current value of `i` is still 1, and the current value of `n` is still greater than 1.
