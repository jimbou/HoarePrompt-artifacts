The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is an integer between 1 and 500, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, max is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 and i is now 1. 
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 and greater than 1, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, `max` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `i` is 1**
