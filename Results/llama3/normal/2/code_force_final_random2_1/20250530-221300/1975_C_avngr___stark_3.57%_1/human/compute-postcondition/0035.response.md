Output State: **_ is 2, t is an integer between 3 and 500, n is an integer at least 2, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, max is the minimum value between the i-th and (i-1)th elements of a, i is at least 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of max has been updated to be the minimum value between the i-th and (i-1)th elements of a, which is greater than the previous value of max (0). The other variables remain unchanged.
