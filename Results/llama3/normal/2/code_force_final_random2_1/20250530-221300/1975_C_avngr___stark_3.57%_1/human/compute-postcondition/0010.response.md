To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 and greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `n` is already greater than 2, it remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 and greater than 2, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 3, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `max` is either 0 or the minimum of `a[2]` and `a[1]`.**
