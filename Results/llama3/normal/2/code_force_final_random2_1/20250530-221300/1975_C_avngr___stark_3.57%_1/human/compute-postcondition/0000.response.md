The code `t = int(input())` accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10^5). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The number of test cases t (1 <= t <= 500) is given before the test cases. So, the first input is the number of test cases t, which is an integer between 1 and 500. This input is accepted and converted to an integer, and assigned to the variable t. The remaining inputs are the test cases, which are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10^5). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**
