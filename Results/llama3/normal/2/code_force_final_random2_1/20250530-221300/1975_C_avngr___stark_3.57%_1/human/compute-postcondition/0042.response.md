Output State: **`_`*_` is 2, t is an integer between 3 and 500, n is an integer at least 3, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, i is at least 3, stdin contains t-5 test cases, max is the minimum value between the i-th and (i-1)th elements of a.**

In this output state, the value of max is updated to be the minimum value between the i-th and (i-1)th elements of the list a. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-5 test cases.
