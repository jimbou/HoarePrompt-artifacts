Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 500, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. If the minimum value between the current element of `a` at index `i` and the previous element of `a` at index `i-1` is greater than the current `max`, then `max` is updated to this minimum value. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.***
