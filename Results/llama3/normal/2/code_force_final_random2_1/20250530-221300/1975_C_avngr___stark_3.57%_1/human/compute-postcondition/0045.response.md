The code prints the maximum value that is greater than the previous maximum value, found by comparing each element in the list `a` with its previous element, starting from the second element (at index 1) up to the last element (at index `n-1`). If no such maximum value is found, it prints 0.

Output: **the maximum value that is greater than the previous maximum value found in the list `a`, or 0 if no such value exists**
