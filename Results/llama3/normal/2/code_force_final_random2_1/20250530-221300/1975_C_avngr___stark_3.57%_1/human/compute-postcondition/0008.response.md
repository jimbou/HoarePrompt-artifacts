Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 and greater than 1, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, `max` is the minimum of `a[2]` and `a[1]`, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `max` has been updated to be the minimum of `a[2]` and `a[1]`, which are the second and first elements of the list `a`, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
