Output State: **_*_ is 2, t is an integer between 3 and 500, n is an integer at least 3, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, max is the minimum value between the i-th and (i-1)th elements of a, i is at least 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of max has been updated to the minimum value between the i-th and (i-1)th elements of list a. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin now contains t-5 test cases instead of t-4 because one test case has been processed.
