The only variables in the loop head are variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is at least 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 3.
State: **_*_ is 2, t is an integer between 3 and 500, n is an integer at least 3, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, if the minimum value between the i-th and (i-1)th elements of a is greater than max, then max is updated to this minimum value, otherwise max remains 0, i is at least 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases.**
