Output State: **_ is t, t is an integer between 1 and 500, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, max is the maximum of the minimum of adjacent pairs of elements in a, stdin contains 0 test cases, i is n-1, and max (which is the maximum of the minimum of adjacent pairs of elements in a) is being printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the loop counter `_` will be equal to the initial value of `t`, which is an integer between 1 and 500. The variables `n` and `a` will still be defined as in the previous iterations, with `n` being an integer between 2 and 10^5 and `a` being a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9. The variable `max` will hold the maximum of the minimum of adjacent pairs of elements in `a`. The standard input `stdin` will be empty, containing 0 test cases. The loop index `i` will be at its final value, which is `n-1`. Finally, the maximum of the minimum of adjacent pairs of elements in `a`, which is stored in `max`, will be printed.
