The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n-1`, which means `i` is at least 1. So, `i` needs to be adjusted to be at least 1 and `n` needs to be adjusted to be at least 2.

State: **_ is 2, t is an integer between 3 and 500, n is an integer at least 2, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, max is 0, i is at least 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases**
