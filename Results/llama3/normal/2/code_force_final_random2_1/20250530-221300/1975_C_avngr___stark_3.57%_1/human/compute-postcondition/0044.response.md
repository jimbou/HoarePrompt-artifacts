Output State: **_ is 2, t is an integer between 3 and 500, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, max is the minimum value between the i-th and (i-1)th elements of a if this minimum value is greater than the previous max, otherwise max remains 0, i is n-1, stdin contains t-4 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The variable `_` remains 2, the variable `t` remains an integer between 3 and 500, the variable `n` remains an integer between 2 and 10^5, the list `a` remains a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, the variable `max` is the minimum value between the `i-th` and `(i-1)th` elements of `a` if this minimum value is greater than the previous `max`, otherwise `max` remains 0, the variable `i` is `n-1`, and the standard input `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases.
