To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is at least 2, and `n` is an integer at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes at least 3. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`_`*_` is 2, t is an integer between 3 and 500, n is an integer at least 3, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, i is at least 3, stdin contains t-5 test cases. max is the minimum value between the i-th and (i-1)th elements of a if this minimum value is greater than the previous max, otherwise max remains 0.**
