The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. If the minimum of `a[2]` and `a[1]` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to the minimum of `a[2]` and `a[1]`.**
