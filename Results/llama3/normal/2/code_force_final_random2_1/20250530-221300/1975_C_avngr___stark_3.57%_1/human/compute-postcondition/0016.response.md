State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `max` is the maximum of the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` for all `i` between 1 and `n-1`, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is `n-1`, and `max` (which is the maximum of the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` for all `i` between 1 and `n-1`) is being printed**
