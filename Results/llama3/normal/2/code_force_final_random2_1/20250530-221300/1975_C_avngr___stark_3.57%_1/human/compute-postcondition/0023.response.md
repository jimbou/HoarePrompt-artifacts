Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `max` is the minimum of `a[2]` and `a[1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `max` is now the smaller of the third and second elements in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still between 2 and 500, `_` still 1, `n` still between 3 and 10^5, `a` still a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `stdin` still containing `t-3` test cases, `i` still 2, and `n` still greater than 2.
