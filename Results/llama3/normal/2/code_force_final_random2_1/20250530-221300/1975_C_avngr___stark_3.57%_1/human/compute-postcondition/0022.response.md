The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2**
