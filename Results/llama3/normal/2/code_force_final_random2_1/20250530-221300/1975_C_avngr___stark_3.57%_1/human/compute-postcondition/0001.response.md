The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, which ensures that the loop will execute, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, `_` is not defined before the loop starts, so it needs to be adjusted to be 0, which is the initial value of the loop variable.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10^5). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**
