Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, p is a list of integers of length n, sorted in non-decreasing order, such that the absolute value of each element in p is less than or equal to n, t is an integer, index is 1, results is an empty list, data is a list of strings split from the input, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    result = func_1(n, p)
    results.append(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is the integer value at index 1 in data, p is a list of n integers from index 2 to index n+1 in data, index is n+1, results contains the result of func_1(n, p), data is a list of strings split from the input, stdin is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is the integer value at index n+1 in data, p is a list of n integers from index n+2 to index 2n+1 in data, index is 2n+1, results contains the result of func_1(n, p) appended to its original value, data is a list of strings split from the input, stdin is empty, t is greater than 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is the integer value at index 2n+2 in data, p is a list of n integers from index 2n+3 to index 3n+2 in data, index is 3n+2, results contains the result of func_1(n, p) appended to its original value, data is a list of strings split from the input, stdin is empty, t is greater than 0




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
