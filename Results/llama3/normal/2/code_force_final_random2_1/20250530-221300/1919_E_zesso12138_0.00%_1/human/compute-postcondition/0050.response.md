Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers of length `n`, and the elements of `p` are sorted in non-decreasing order, `dp` is a list of 2n+1 integers where `dp[j - 1]` is `(dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j - 1 >= 0`, otherwise `dp[j + 1]` is `(dp[j] + dp[j + 1]) % MOD` if `j + 1 <= 2 * n`, otherwise `dp` remains unchanged, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 2, `new_dp` is not defined, `2 * n + 1` is greater than 0, and `j` is `2 * n`. If `dp[j]` is greater than 0 and `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, then `dp[j + 1]` is `(dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `dp` has been updated to be the same as `new_dp`, which means that the elements of `dp` have been updated according to the rules specified in the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged.
