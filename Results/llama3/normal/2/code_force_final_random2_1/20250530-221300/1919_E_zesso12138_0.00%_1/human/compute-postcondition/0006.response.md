Output State: **n is the integer value at index 2n+2 in data, p is a list of n integers from index 2n+3 to index 3n+2 in data, index is 3n+2, results contains the result of func_1(n, p) appended to its original value, data is a list of strings split from the input, stdin is empty, t is greater than 0**

The code block modifies the values of `n`, `p`, `index`, and `results`. The first line assigns the integer value at index `index` in `data` to `n`, which was previously the integer value at index `n+1`. The second line increments `index` by 1. The third line assigns a list of `n` integers from index `index` to `index + n` in `data` to `p`, which was previously a list of `n` integers from index `n+2` to `2n+1`. The fourth line increments `index` by `n`. The fifth line assigns the result of `func_1(n, p)` to `result`, and the sixth line appends `result` to `results`. The values of `data`, `stdin`, and `t` remain unchanged.
