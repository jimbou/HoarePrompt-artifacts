To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for res in results:`. Therefore, we can only adjust the states of `res` and `results`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 2 results, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 1 result, `res` is the first result in the list.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `results` must have at least 2 results, and `res` must be the second result in the list.

State: **`n` is the integer value at index `t*n+1` in `data`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from index `t*n+2` to index `(t+1)*n+1` in `data`, `index` is `(t+1)*n+1`, `results` is a list of results that must have at least 2 results, `res` is the second result in the list, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `stdin` is empty**
