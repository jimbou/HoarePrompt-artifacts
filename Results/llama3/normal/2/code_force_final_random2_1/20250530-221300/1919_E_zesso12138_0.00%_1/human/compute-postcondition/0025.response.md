Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers of length `n`, and the elements of `p` are sorted in non-decreasing order, `dp` is a list of 2n+1 integers where `dp` is updated such that if there exists an element `dp[j]` greater than 0, then `dp[j - 1]` is `(dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` and `dp[j + 1]` is `(dp[j] + dp[j + 1]) % MOD` and the rest of the elements are 0, and `j` is the index of the element in `dp` that is greater than 0, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 1, `new_dp` is a list of 2n+1 integers and is equal to `dp`.**

In this output state, the value of `dp` is updated based on the previous values of `new_dp` and the index `j` of the element in `dp` that is greater than 0. The values of `n`, `p`, `offset`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `new_dp` is now equal to `dp`.
