Functionality: This function calculates and returns the value at a specific index in a dynamic programming (dp) table. The index is determined by adding the last element of a sorted list of integers (p) to the length of the list (n). The dp table is initialized with a length of 2n+1, and its values are updated iteratively based on the previous values, using modular arithmetic with a modulus (MOD). The function takes a positive integer n and a sorted list of integers p as input and returns an integer value from the dp table.
