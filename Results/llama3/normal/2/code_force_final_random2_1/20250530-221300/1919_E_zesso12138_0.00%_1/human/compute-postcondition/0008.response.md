According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. If `results` has at least 1 result the loop executes. Before the loop starts, `n` is the integer value at index `t*n+1` in `data`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from index `t*n+2` to index `(t+1)*n+1` in `data`, `index` is `(t+1)*n+1`, `results` contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to its original value, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `stdin` is empty. So for the loop to be executed `results` must have at least 1 result and `res` is the first result in the list.
State: **`n` is the integer value at index `t*n+1` in `data`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from index `t*n+2` to index `(t+1)*n+1` in `data`, `index` is `(t+1)*n+1`, `results` is a list of results that must have at least 1 result, `res` is the first result in the list, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `stdin` is empty**
