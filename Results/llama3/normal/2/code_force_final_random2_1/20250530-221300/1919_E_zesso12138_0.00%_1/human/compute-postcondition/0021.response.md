Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers of length `n`, and the elements of `p` are sorted in non-decreasing order, `dp` is a list of 2n+1 integers where `dp[n]` is 1, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `new_dp` is a list of 2n+1 integers where `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`, and if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, then `new_dp[j + 1]` is still `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `p`, `dp`, `offset`, and `i` remain the same. The value of `j` is still 3. The list `new_dp` is updated at index `j - 1` (which is 2) with the value `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. The value of `new_dp[j + 1]` remains the same as before, which is `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`.
