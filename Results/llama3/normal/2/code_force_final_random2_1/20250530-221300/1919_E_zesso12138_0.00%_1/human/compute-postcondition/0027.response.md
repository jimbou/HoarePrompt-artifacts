Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers of length `n`, and the elements of `p` are sorted in non-decreasing order, `dp` is a list of 2n+1 integers where `dp` is updated such that if there exists an element `dp[j]` greater than 0, then `dp[j - 1]` is `(dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` and `dp[j + 1]` is `(dp[j] + dp[j + 1]) % MOD` and the rest of the elements are 0, and `j` is the index of the element in `dp` that is greater than 0, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 2, `new_dp` is a list of 2n+1 zeros.**

In natural language, the output state is that all the variables retain their initial values except for `new_dp`, which is now a list of 2n+1 zeros. The initial values of `n`, `p`, `dp`, `offset`, and `i` are preserved, but `new_dp` is reset to a list of zeros with the same length as `dp`.
