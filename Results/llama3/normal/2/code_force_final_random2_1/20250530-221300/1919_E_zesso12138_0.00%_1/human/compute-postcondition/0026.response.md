To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers of length `n`, and the elements of `p` are sorted in non-decreasing order, `dp` is a list of 2n+1 integers where `dp` is updated such that if there exists an element `dp[j]` greater than 0, then `dp[j - 1]` is `(dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` and `dp[j + 1]` is `(dp[j] + dp[j + 1]) % MOD` and the rest of the elements are 0, and `j` is the index of the element in `dp` that is greater than 0, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 2, `new_dp` is a list of 2n+1 integers and is equal to `dp`.**
