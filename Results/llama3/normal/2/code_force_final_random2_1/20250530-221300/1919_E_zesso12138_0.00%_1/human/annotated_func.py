#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function calculates and returns the value at a specific index in a dynamic programming (dp) table. The index is determined by adding the last element of a sorted list of integers (p) to the length of the list (n). The dp table is initialized with a length of 2n+1, and its values are updated iteratively based on the previous values, using modular arithmetic with a modulus (MOD). The function takes a positive integer n and a sorted list of integers p as input and returns an integer value from the dp table.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and p is a list of integers of length n, sorted in non-decreasing order, such that the absolute value of each element in p is less than or equal to n.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads input from standard input, processes it into a list of integers and a count, calls the function func_1 with these values, and appends the result to a list of results. It repeats this process a specified number of times, then prints each result in the list.
