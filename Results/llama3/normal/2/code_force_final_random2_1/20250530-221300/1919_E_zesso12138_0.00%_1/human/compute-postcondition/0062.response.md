The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `2 * n + 1`. If `j` is less than `2 * n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `2 * n + 1` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `p` is a list of integers of length `n`, and the elements of `p` are sorted in non-decreasing order, `dp` is a list of 2n+1 integers where `dp[j - 1]` is `(dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j - 1 >= 0`, otherwise `dp[j + 1]` is `(dp[j] + dp[j + 1]) % MOD` if `j + 1 <= 2 * n`, otherwise `dp` remains unchanged, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 3, `new_dp` is a list of 2n+1 integers where `new_dp[j + 1]` is `(dp[j] + new_dp[j + 1]) % MOD` if `j + 1 <= 2 * n`, otherwise `new_dp` remains unchanged, `2 * n + 1` is at least 2, and `j` is 1. If `dp[j] > 0`, then `new_dp[j - 1]` is `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j - 1 >= 0`, otherwise `new_dp` remains unchanged.**
