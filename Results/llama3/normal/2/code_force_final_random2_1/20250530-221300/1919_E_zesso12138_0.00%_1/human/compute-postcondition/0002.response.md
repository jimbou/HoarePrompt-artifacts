Output State: **n is the integer value at index 1 in data, p is a list of n integers from index 2 to index n+1 in data, index is n+1, results contains the result of func_1(n, p), data is a list of strings split from the input, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer value at index 1 in the `data` list. The list `p` now contains `n` integers from index 2 to index `n+1` in the `data` list. The `index` variable has been incremented by `n`, so it now points to the position after the `n` integers that were used to update `p`. The `results` list now contains the result of the function `func_1` called with the updated `n` and `p` as arguments. The `data` list remains unchanged, and the `stdin` remains empty.
