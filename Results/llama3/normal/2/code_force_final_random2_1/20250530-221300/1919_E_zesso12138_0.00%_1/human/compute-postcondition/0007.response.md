Output State: **n is the integer value at index t*n+1 in data, p is a list of n integers from index t*n+2 to index (t+1)*n+1 in data, index is (t+1)*n+1, results contains the result of func_1(n, p) appended to its original value, data is a list of strings split from the input, stdin is empty**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable n takes the integer value at index t*n+1 in the data list, the variable p is a list of n integers from index t*n+2 to index (t+1)*n+1 in the data list, the index variable is (t+1)*n+1, the results list contains the result of func_1(n, p) appended to its original value, the data list remains unchanged as a list of strings split from the input, and the stdin remains empty.
