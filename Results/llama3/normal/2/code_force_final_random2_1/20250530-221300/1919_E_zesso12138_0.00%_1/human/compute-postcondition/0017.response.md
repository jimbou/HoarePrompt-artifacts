Output State: **`n` is the integer value at index `t*n+1` in `data`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from index `t*n+2` to index `(t+1)*n+1` in `data`, `index` is `(t+1)*n+1`, `results` is a list of results that must have at least as many results as the length of `results`, `res` is the last result in the list, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `stdin` is empty, and the last result in the list of results which is `res` has been printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has executed for all the iterations, and the last result in the list of results has been printed. The values of `n`, `p`, `index`, and `data` remain unchanged, and `stdin` is still empty. The loop has iterated over all the results in the `results` list, and the last result has been printed.
