Output State: **n is the integer value at index n+1 in data, p is a list of n integers from index n+2 to index 2n+1 in data, index is 2n+1, results contains the result of func_1(n, p) appended to its original value, data is a list of strings split from the input, stdin is empty, t is greater than 1**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer value at index `n+1` in `data`. The list `p` now contains `n` integers from index `n+2` to index `2n+1` in `data`. The `index` variable has been incremented by `n` and now points to `2n+1`. The `results` list has been appended with the result of `func_1(n, p)`, adding a new element to its original value. The `data` list remains unchanged, and `stdin` is still empty. The value of `t` remains greater than 1.
