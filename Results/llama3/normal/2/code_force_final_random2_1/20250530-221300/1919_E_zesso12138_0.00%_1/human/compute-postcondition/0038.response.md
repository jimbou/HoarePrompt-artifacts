Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers of length `n`, and the elements of `p` are sorted in non-decreasing order, `dp` is a list of 2n+1 integers where `dp` is updated such that if there exists an element `dp[j]` greater than 0, then `dp[j - 1]` is `(dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` and `dp[j + 1]` is `(dp[j] + dp[j + 1]) % MOD` and the rest of the elements are 0, and `j` is the index of the element in `dp` that is greater than 0, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 2, `new_dp` is a list of 2n+1 integers where `new_dp[j + 1]` is `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j + 1 <= 2 * n`, otherwise `new_dp` remains unchanged, `2 * n + 1` is greater than 0, and `j` is either 1 or 2. If `dp[j]` is greater than 0, then `new_dp` is updated accordingly, otherwise `new_dp` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `new_dp` has been updated. Specifically, if `j` is either 1 or 2 and `dp[j]` is greater than 0, then `new_dp[j + 1]` has been updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. Otherwise, `new_dp` remains unchanged.
