The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again t must be greater than 1.
State: **n is the integer value at index 1 in data, p is a list of n integers from index 2 to index n+1 in data, index is n+1, results contains the result of func_1(n, p), data is a list of strings split from the input, stdin is empty, t is greater than 1**
