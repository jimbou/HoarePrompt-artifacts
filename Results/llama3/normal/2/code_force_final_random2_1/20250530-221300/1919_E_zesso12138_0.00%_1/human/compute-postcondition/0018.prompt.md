You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and p is a list of integers of length n, sorted in non-decreasing order, such that the absolute value of each element in p is less than or equal to n.
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(n, p)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: n is the integer value at index t*n+1 in data, p is a list of n integers from index t*n+2 to index (t+1)*n+1 in data, index is (t+1)*n+1, results contains the result of func_1(n, p) appended to its original value, data is a list of strings split from the input, stdin is empty
    for res in results:
        print(res)
        
    #State: `n` is the integer value at index `t*n+1` in `data`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from index `t*n+2` to index `(t+1)*n+1` in `data`, `index` is `(t+1)*n+1`, `results` is a list of results that must have at least as many results as the length of `results`, `res` is the last result in the list, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `stdin` is empty, and the last result in the list of results which is `res` has been printed.

```

Return Postconditions: `n` is the integer value at index `t*n+1` in `data`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from index `t*n+2` to index `(t+1)*n+1` in `data`, `index` is `(t+1)*n+1`, `results` is a list of results that must have at least as many results as the length of `results`, `res` is the last result in the list, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `stdin` is empty, and the last result in the list of results which is `res` has been printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
