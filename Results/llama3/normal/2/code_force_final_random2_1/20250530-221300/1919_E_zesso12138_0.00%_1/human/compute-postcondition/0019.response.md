Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers of length `n`, and the elements of `p` are sorted in non-decreasing order, `dp` is a list of 2n+1 integers where `dp[n]` is 1, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `new_dp` is a list of 2n+1 integers where `new_dp[j + 1]` is `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `new_dp[j + 1]` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value and `dp[j]`, modulo `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged.
