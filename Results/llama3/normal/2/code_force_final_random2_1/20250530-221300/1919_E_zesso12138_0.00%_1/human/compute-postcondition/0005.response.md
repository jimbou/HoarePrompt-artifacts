To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable in the loop head is `t`. The loop will execute again if `t` is greater than 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`n` is the integer value at index n+1 in data, `p` is a list of n integers from index n+2 to index 2n+1 in data, `index` is 2n+1, `results` contains the result of func_1(n, p) appended to its original value, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `stdin` is empty, `t` is greater than 0**
