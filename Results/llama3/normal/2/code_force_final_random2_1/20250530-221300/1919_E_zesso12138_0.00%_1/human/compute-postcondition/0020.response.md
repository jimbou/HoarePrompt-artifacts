Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers of length `n`, and the elements of `p` are sorted in non-decreasing order, `dp` is a list of 2n+1 integers where `dp[n]` is 1, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `new_dp` is a list of 2n+1 integers. If `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, then `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.***
