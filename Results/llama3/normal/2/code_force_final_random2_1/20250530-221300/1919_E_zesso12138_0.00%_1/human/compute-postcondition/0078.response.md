Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `p` is a list of integers of length `n`, and the elements of `p` are sorted in non-decreasing order, `dp` is a list of 2n+1 integers where `dp[j - 1]` is (`dp[j - 1]` + `dp[j]`) % MOD if `j - 1` >= 0, otherwise `dp[j + 1]` is (`dp[j]` + `dp[j + 1]`) % MOD if `j + 1` <= 2 * `n`, otherwise `dp` remains unchanged, `offset` is `n`, `i` is `n`, `new_dp` is a list of 2n+1 integers where `new_dp[j + 1]` is (`new_dp[j + 1]` + `dp[j]`) % MOD if `j + 1` <= 2 * `n`, otherwise `new_dp` remains unchanged, 2 * `n` + 1 is at least 2 * `n` + 1, and `j` is 2 * `n`. If `dp[j]` is greater than 0, then `new_dp[j - 1]` is (`new_dp[j - 1]` + `dp[j]`) % MOD if `j - 1` >= 0, otherwise `new_dp` remains unchanged. If `j + 1` <= 2 * `n`, then `new_dp[2 * n]` is (`new_dp[2 * n]` + `dp[2 * n - 1]`) % MOD, otherwise `new_dp` remains unchanged. If `j - 1` >= 0, then `new_dp[2 * n - 1]` is (`new_dp[2 * n - 1]` + `dp[2 * n]`) % MOD, otherwise `new_dp` remains unchanged. If `dp[j]` is not greater than 0, then `new_dp` remains unchanged. `final_sum` is `p[-1]` + `offset` which is `p[-1]` + `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `final_sum` is calculated by adding the last element of the list `p` and the value of `offset`, which is equal to `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
