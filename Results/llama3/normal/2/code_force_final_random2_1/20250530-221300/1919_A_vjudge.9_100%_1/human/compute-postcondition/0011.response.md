Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).**

Explanation: The code `a, b = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads a line from the input, splits it into two integers, and assigns them to `a` and `b`, respectively. Since `stdin` initially contains `t-2` lines, each containing two integers, after reading one line, `stdin` will contain `t-3` lines. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
