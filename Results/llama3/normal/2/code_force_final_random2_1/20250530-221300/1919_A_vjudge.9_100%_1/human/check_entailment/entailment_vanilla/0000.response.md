Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, who take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The key observation is that the game's outcome depends on the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

The provided program uses the absolute difference between `a` and `b` to determine the winner. If the difference is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This approach is based on the idea that if the difference is even, Alice and Bob can mirror each other's moves, resulting in Bob winning. If the difference is odd, Alice can make a move that forces Bob to lose.

The program correctly implements this logic using the modulo operator (`%`). If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, the remainder of the division by 2 is 0, and Bob wins. Otherwise, Alice wins.

The program also correctly handles the input and output formats, reading the number of test cases and the values of `a` and `b` for each test case, and printing the winner for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
