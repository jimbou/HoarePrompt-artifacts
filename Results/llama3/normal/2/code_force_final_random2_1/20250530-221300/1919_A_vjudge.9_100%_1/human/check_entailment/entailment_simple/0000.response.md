Reasoning:

The problem can be solved by analyzing the parity of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. If the difference is even, Bob will win; otherwise, Alice will win.

The given program correctly implements this logic. It calculates the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and checks if it is even by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder is 0, it means the difference is even, and 'Bob' is printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is printed.

The program's logic is correct because:

* If the difference is even, Alice and Bob can keep swapping wallets and removing coins until both wallets are empty. Since the difference is even, they will both run out of coins at the same time, and Bob will win because he makes the last move.
* If the difference is odd, Alice can swap wallets and remove coins to make the difference even. Then, Bob will be forced to make a move that will make the difference odd again. This process will continue until both wallets are empty, and Alice will win because she makes the last move.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
