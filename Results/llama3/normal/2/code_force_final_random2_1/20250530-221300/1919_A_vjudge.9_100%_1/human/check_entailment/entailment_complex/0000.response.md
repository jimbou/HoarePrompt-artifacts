Reasoning:

The problem statement describes a game where Alice and Bob take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The game ends when one player cannot make a valid move, and that player loses. The problem asks to determine who will win the game if both players play optimally.

The provided Python program uses a simple strategy to determine the winner. It calculates the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets and checks if it is even or odd. If the difference is even, it prints "Bob", and if it is odd, it prints "Alice".

The reasoning behind this strategy is that if the difference is even, Alice will always be forced to make a move that will leave Bob with an even number of coins, allowing Bob to win. On the other hand, if the difference is odd, Alice can always make a move that will leave Bob with an odd number of coins, forcing Bob to lose.

This strategy is correct because it takes into account the optimal moves that both players can make. If Alice plays optimally, she will always try to leave Bob with an odd number of coins, and if Bob plays optimally, he will always try to leave Alice with an even number of coins. The program's strategy correctly determines the winner based on the initial number of coins in each wallet.

Correctness: **True**
