Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The game ends when one player cannot make a valid move. The program provided uses a simple strategy based on the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

The program works by iterating over each test case, reading the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, and calculating the absolute difference between them. If the absolute difference is even, it prints "Bob", and if it's odd, it prints "Alice".

The reasoning behind this strategy is that if the absolute difference is even, Alice and Bob can keep exchanging wallets and removing coins in a way that maintains the even difference. Eventually, both players will have an equal number of coins, and since Alice makes the first move, Bob will be the one who cannot make a valid move and will lose.

On the other hand, if the absolute difference is odd, Alice can always make a move that will leave Bob with an even number of coins. This will force Bob to make a move that will leave Alice with an odd number of coins, and so on. Eventually, Alice will be the one who can make a valid move, and Bob will be the one who cannot, resulting in Alice's win.

Correctness: **True**
