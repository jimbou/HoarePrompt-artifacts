Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-5 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, 'Bob' is printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the next pair of integers from the input, which are still between 1 and 10^9. The stdin now contains t-5 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). The condition for printing 'Bob' or 'Alice' remains the same, based on the absolute difference between `a` and `b`.
