Output: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). The current value of the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, and 'Bob' is being printed**
