Output: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-5 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, 'Bob' is printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is printed, and 'Alice' is printed**
