Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `t`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin is empty. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, 'Bob' is printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, the loop counter `i` has reached the value of `t`, the values of `a` and `b` are still integers between 1 and 10^9, and the standard input (stdin) is empty because all lines have been processed. The loop prints 'Bob' if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, and 'Alice' otherwise.
