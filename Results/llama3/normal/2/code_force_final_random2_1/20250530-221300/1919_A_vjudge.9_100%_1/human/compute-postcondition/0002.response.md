Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9)**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values of the two integers from the first line of the input, which are between 1 and 10^9. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), since one line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
