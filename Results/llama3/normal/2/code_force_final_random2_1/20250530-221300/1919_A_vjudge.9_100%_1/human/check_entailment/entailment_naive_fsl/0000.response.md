Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly determines the winner of the game based on the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key insight is that the player who wins is determined by the parity of the difference between the number of coins in the two wallets. If the difference is even, Bob wins; if the difference is odd, Alice wins.

The program correctly implements this logic by calculating the absolute difference between the number of coins in the two wallets and checking if it is even or odd using the modulo operator (`%`). If the result is 0, the difference is even, and Bob wins; otherwise, the difference is odd, and Alice wins.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles all possible inputs, including cases where the number of coins in one or both wallets is 0, and cases where the difference between the number of coins is large. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
