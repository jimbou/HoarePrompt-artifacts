Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `sz` is the third element in the list `a`, `mexsize` is increased by 1**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, and `sz` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The only change is in the value of `mexsize`, which is incremented by 1.
