Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`. If the first element in the list `a` is equal to 1, then `mexsize` is 2 and the first element in the list `a` is still 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
