Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, tc is 2, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of positive integers, maxsize is the maximum value in a, mexsize is 1, sz is not defined**.

The code snippet provided modifies the values of `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, and `mexsize`. The first line assigns a new value to `n` from the input, which is a positive integer. The second line assigns a new list of positive integers to `a` from the input, and the third line calculates the maximum value in `a` and assigns it to `maxsize`. The fourth line sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The fifth line assigns the value 1 to `mexsize`, which is the smallest positive integer not in `a`. The variable `sz` is not defined in the code snippet, so its value is not updated.

Note that the initial state of `sz` is not explicitly defined in the precondition, so it is not included in the output state. The values of `t` and `tc` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.
