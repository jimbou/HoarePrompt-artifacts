Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer and then a list of integers. The first integer is a positive integer and represents the number of piles in the game. The list of integers represents the initial number of stones in each pile and contains the same number of elements as the first integer. Each element in the list is a positive integer.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first input integer from the stdin, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin now contains one less test case, but the structure of each test case remains the same, with two inputs: a positive integer representing the number of piles and a list of positive integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile.
