Let's analyze the given state and the for loop statement.

The state at the end of the previous iteration is:

* `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2
* `tc` is 2
* `n` is a positive integer
* `a` is a sorted list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element
* `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`
* If the first element in the list `a` is equal to 1, then `mexsize` is 2 and the first element in the list `a` is still 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.

The for loop statement is:
```
for sz in a:
    # the loop body is omit
```
The only variable in the loop head is `sz`, which is an element of the list `a`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

* The list `a` must have at least one more element for the loop to execute again.
* The variable `sz` will take on the value of the next element in the list `a`.

Since the list `a` is sorted, the next element in the list will be greater than or equal to the current first element in the list.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `sz` is the second element in the list `a`**

Note that we didn't change the values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, or `maxsize` as they are not related to the loop head. We only adjusted the state of `a` and `sz` to reflect the next iteration of the loop.
