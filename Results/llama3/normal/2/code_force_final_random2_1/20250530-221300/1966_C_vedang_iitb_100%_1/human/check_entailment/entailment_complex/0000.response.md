Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The problem can be solved by finding the smallest positive integer that is not in the list of stones (mexsize) and checking if it is even or odd. If mexsize is even, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. The program correctly implements this logic.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of piles and the list of stones, sorts the list, finds the maximum number of stones, and determines mexsize. It then prints 'Alice' if mexsize is even or 'Bob' if mexsize is odd.

The program's logic is correct because the game is won by the player who can make the last move. If mexsize is even, Alice can make the last move by choosing a number that is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile, which is mexsize. If mexsize is odd, Bob can make the last move by choosing a number that is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile, which is mexsize - 1.

Therefore, the program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the number of stones in each pile.

Correctness: **True**
