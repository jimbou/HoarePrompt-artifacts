Functionality: **This function determines the winner of a game based on the number of stones in each pile. It accepts multiple test cases as input, where each test case consists of a positive integer representing the number of piles and a list of positive integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The function sorts the list of stones, finds the maximum number of stones, and determines the smallest positive integer that is not in the list (mexsize). It then prints 'Alice' if mexsize is even or 'Bob' if mexsize is odd, regardless of whether mexsize is greater than the maximum number of stones or not.**
