Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, tc is 1, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, sz is the second element in a, maxsize is the maximum value in a. If sz is equal to mexsize, then mexsize is increased by 1 if sz is not equal to 2, otherwise mexsize is set to 4. Otherwise, the values of mexsize remains unchanged.***
