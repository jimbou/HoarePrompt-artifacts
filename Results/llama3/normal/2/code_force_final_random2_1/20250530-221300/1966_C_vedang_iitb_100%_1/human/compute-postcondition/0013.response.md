Output State: **t is a positive integer, tc is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of positive integers, maxsize is the maximum value in a, mexsize is the smallest positive integer that is not in a, sz is the last element in a.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer that is not present in the list `a`. The variable `sz` will be the last element in the list `a`. The other variables `t`, `tc`, `n`, `maxsize` remain unchanged.
