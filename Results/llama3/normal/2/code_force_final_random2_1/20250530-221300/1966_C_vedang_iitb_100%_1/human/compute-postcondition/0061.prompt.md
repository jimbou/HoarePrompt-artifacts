Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer and then a list of integers. The first integer is a positive integer and represents the number of piles in the game. The list of integers represents the initial number of stones in each pile and contains the same number of elements as the first integer. Each element in the list is a positive integer.
Code of the loop:
for tc in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    maxsize = max(a)
    a.sort()
    mexsize = 1
    for sz in a:
        if sz == mexsize:
            mexsize = mexsize + 1
    if mexsize > maxsize:
        print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 0 else 'Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer, tc is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of positive integers, maxsize is the maximum value in a, mexsize is the smallest positive integer that is not in a, sz is the last element in a. If mexsize is greater than maxsize, either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether mexsize is even or odd. If mexsize is less than or equal to maxsize, the result of the condition "mexsize % 2 == 1" is printed, which is either 'Alice' if mexsize is odd or 'Bob' if mexsize is even.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer, tc is 1, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of positive integers, maxsize is the maximum value in a, mexsize is the smallest positive integer not in a, sz is the last element in a. If mexsize is greater than maxsize, either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether mexsize is even or odd. If mexsize is less than or equal to maxsize, 'Alice' is printed if mexsize is odd, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `sz` is the last element in the list `a`, and `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer that is not in the list `a`. Either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether `mexsize` is even or odd, regardless of whether `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize` or less than or equal to `maxsize`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
