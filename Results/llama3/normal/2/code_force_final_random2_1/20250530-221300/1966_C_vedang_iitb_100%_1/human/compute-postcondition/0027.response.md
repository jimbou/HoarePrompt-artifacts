The only variable in the loop head is variable sz and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a. If the list a has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, a is a sorted list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, sz is the first element in a. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list a must have at least 2 elements and sz is the second element in a.
State: **t is a positive integer, tc is 1, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, sz is the second element in a, maxsize is the maximum value in a. If the second element in a is equal to 2, then mexsize is 3. Otherwise, the values of mexsize remains unchanged.**
