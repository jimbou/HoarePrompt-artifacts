To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states accordingly.

The loop head is `for sz in a:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `sz` and `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, and `sz` is the last element processed.

For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least one more element, and `sz` should be the next element in the list.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `tc` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, if the first element of `a` is 1, then `mexsize` is 2 and `sz` is the second element in `a`. Otherwise, `mexsize` and `sz` remain unchanged.**
