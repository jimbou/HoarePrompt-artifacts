Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, tc is 1, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of positive integers, maxsize is the maximum value in a, mexsize is 1, sz is the last element in a.
Code of the loop:
for sz in a:
    if sz == mexsize:
        mexsize = mexsize + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer, tc is 1, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, maxsize is the maximum value in a. If the first element in a is equal to 1, then mexsize is 2. Otherwise, the values of mexsize remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer, tc is 1, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, sz is the second element in a, maxsize is the maximum value in a. If sz is equal to mexsize, then mexsize is increased by 1 if sz is not equal to 2, otherwise mexsize is set to 4. Otherwise, the values of mexsize remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `tc` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers with at least 3 elements, `sz` is the third element in `a`, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains unchanged or is increased by 1 if `sz` is not equal to 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
