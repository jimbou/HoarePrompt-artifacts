Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `tc` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, if the first element of `a` is 1, then `mexsize` is 2 and `sz` is 1. Otherwise, `mexsize` and `sz` remain unchanged.***
