Output State: **t is a positive integer, tc is 1, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of positive integers, maxsize is the maximum value in a, mexsize is 1, sz is the last element in a.**

The code snippet consists of four lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `a`. The third line assigns the maximum value in `a` to `maxsize`. The fourth line assigns 1 to `mexsize`. 

The initial state of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, `mexsize`, and `sz` remains unchanged. The value of `n` is updated to the input value, and `a` is updated to the list of integers from stdin. The value of `maxsize` is updated to the maximum value in `a`, and `mexsize` is set to 1. The value of `sz` remains the last element in `a`. 

Note that the code does not modify the values of `t`, `tc`, or `sz`. The values of `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, and `mexsize` are updated based on the input and the operations performed in the code.
