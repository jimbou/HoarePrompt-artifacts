Output State: **t is a positive integer, tc is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of positive integers, maxsize is the maximum value in a, mexsize is 1**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `tc` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1 as two inputs are read from stdin. The value of `n` is a positive integer as it is assigned the value of the first input from stdin. The list `a` is a sorted list of positive integers as it is assigned the value of the second input from stdin, which is a list of positive integers, and then sorted in ascending order. The value of `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a` as it is assigned the maximum value of the list `a`. The value of `mexsize` is 1 as it is assigned the value 1.
