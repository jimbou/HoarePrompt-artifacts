Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `sz` is the second element in the list `a`, `mexsize` is `mexsize + 1`**

In this output state, the value of `mexsize` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` is still sorted and has at least 2 elements, with `maxsize` being the maximum value in `a` and `sz` being the second element in the list. The values of `t`, `tc`, and `n` are still positive integers, with `t` being greater than or equal to 2.
