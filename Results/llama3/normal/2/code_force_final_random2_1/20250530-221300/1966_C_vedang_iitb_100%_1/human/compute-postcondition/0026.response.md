Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, tc is 1, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, maxsize is the maximum value in a. If the first element in a is equal to 1, then mexsize is 2. Otherwise, the values of mexsize remains unchanged.***
