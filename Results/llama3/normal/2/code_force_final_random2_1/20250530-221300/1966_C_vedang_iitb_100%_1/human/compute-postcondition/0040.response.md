Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, tc is 1, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of positive integers, maxsize is the maximum value in a, mexsize is the smallest positive integer not in a, sz is the last element in a. If mexsize is greater than maxsize, either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether mexsize is even or odd. If mexsize is less than or equal to maxsize, 'Alice' is printed if mexsize is odd, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.***
