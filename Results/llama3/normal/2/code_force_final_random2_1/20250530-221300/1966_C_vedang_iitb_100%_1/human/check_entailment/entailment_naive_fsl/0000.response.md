Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the `mexsize` variable. The `mexsize` is supposed to be the smallest positive integer that is not present in the array `a`. However, the program increments `mexsize` only when it finds an element in `a` that is equal to the current `mexsize`. This means that if there are gaps in the array `a`, the program will not correctly calculate the `mexsize`.

For example, consider the input `[1, 3, 4, 5]`. The `mexsize` should be 2, but the program will calculate it as 5, because it only increments `mexsize` when it finds an element in `a` that is equal to the current `mexsize`.

Therefore, the program does not correctly determine the winner of the game in all cases, and its correctness is **False**.
