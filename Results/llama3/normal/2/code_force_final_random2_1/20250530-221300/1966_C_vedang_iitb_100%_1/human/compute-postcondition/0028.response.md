Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `tc` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `sz` is the second element in `a`, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`. If the second element in `a` is equal to 2, then `mexsize` is 4. Otherwise, `mexsize` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, all variables from the initial state remain unchanged except for `mexsize`. The value of `mexsize` is incremented by 1. If the second element in `a` is equal to 2, then `mexsize` becomes 4; otherwise, its value is increased by 1.
