To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `tc` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `t` is a positive integer, it is already guaranteed to be at least 1. However, to make the loop execute, `tc` needs to be adjusted to 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `tc` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer and then a list of integers. The first integer is a positive integer and represents the number of piles in the game. The list of integers represents the initial number of stones in each pile and contains the same number of elements as the first integer. Each element in the list is a positive integer.**
