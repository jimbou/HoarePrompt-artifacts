To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head, which are `tc` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `tc` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `tc` is 1, and `t` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `tc` must be incremented by 1, so `tc` becomes 2. The value of `t` remains the same, but for the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than or equal to 2.

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `maxsize`, `mexsize`, and `sz`) are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not in `a`, `sz` is the last element in `a`.**
