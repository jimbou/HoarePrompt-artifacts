To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `sz` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, we can adjust the state of `a` to have at least 1 element. Additionally, we can adjust the state of `sz` to be the first element in the list `a`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `mexsize` is 1, `sz` is the first element in the list `a`**
