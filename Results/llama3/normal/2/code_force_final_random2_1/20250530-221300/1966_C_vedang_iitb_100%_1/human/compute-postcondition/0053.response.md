Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `sz` is the last element in the list `a`, `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer that is not in the list `a`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the state of the variables not affected by the loop remains unchanged. The loop iterates over the sorted list `a`, and for each element `sz`, it checks if `sz` is equal to `mexsize`. If it is, `mexsize` is incremented by 1. This process continues until all elements in the list `a` have been checked. As a result, `mexsize` becomes the smallest positive integer that is not in the list `a`. The last element in the list `a` is assigned to `sz`.
