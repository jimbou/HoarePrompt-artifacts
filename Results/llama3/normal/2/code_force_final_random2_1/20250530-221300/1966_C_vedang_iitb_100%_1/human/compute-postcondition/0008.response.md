Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `tc` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, if the first element of `a` is 1, then `mexsize` is 3 and `sz` is the second element in `a`. Otherwise, `mexsize` is increased by 1 and `sz` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `mexsize` is increased by 1. If the first element of `a` is 1, then `mexsize` is now 3 and `sz` is the second element in `a`. Otherwise, `mexsize` is increased by 1 and `sz` remains unchanged. The values of the other variables are not affected.
