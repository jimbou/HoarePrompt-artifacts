stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer and then a list of integers. The first integer is a positive integer and represents the number of piles in the game. The list of integers represents the initial number of stones in each pile and contains the same number of elements as the first integer. Each element in the list is a positive integer.
