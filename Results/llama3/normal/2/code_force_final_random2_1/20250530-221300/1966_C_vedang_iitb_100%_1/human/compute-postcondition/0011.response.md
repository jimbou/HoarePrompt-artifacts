Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `tc` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers that must have at least 3 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `sz` is the third element in `a`, `mexsize` is 4 if the first element of `a` is 1 and `sz` is equal to 3, otherwise `mexsize` is 3 if the first element of `a` is 1 and `sz` is not equal to 3, otherwise `mexsize` is increased by 1 if `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, otherwise `mexsize` remains unchanged**

In this output state, the value of `mexsize` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `mexsize` have been updated to reflect the new value.
