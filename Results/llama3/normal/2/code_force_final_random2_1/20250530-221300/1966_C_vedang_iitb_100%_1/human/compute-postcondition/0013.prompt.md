Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, tc is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of positive integers, maxsize is the maximum value in a, mexsize is 1
Code of the loop:
for sz in a:
    if sz == mexsize:
        mexsize = mexsize + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer, `tc` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, if the first element of `a` is 1, then `mexsize` is 2 and `sz` is 1. Otherwise, `mexsize` and `sz` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `tc` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`. If the first element of `a` is 1 and `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is 3 and `sz` is the second element in `a`. Otherwise, if the first element of `a` is 1 and `sz` is not equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is 2 and `sz` is the second element in `a`. If the first element of `a` is not 1, then `mexsize` is increased by 1 if `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, otherwise `mexsize` and `sz` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `tc` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers that must have at least 3 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `sz` is the third element in `a`. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is updated to 4 if the first element of `a` is 1 and `sz` is equal to 3, otherwise `mexsize` is updated to 3 if the first element of `a` is 1 and `sz` is not equal to 3, otherwise `mexsize` is increased by 1. If `sz` is not equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
