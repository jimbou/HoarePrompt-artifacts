To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `tc` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `tc` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `tc` is 0 and `t` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `tc` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `tc` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer that is not in `a`, `sz` is the last element in `a`. If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether `mexsize` is even or odd. If `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`, the result of the condition "mexsize % 2 == 1" is printed, which is either 'Alice' if `mexsize` is odd or 'Bob' if `mexsize` is even.**
