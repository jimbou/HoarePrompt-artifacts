Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `tc` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers with at least 3 elements, `sz` is the third element in `a`, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains unchanged or is increased by 1 if `sz` is not equal to 2.***
