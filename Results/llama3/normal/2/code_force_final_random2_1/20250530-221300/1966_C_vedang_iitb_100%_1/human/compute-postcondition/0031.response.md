Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `tc` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers with at least 3 elements, `sz` is the third element in `a`, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `mexsize` is increased by 1**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial properties, except for `mexsize`, which is incremented by 1. The list `a` remains sorted with at least 3 elements, and `sz` is still the third element in `a`. The maximum value in `a` is still represented by `maxsize`. The values of `t`, `tc`, and `n` remain unchanged.
