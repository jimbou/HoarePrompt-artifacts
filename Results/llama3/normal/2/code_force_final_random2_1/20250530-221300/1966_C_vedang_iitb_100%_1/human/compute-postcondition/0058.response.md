The code prints 'Alice' if the smallest positive integer that is not in the list `a` (mexsize) is odd, otherwise it prints 'Bob'. Since mexsize is less than or equal to maxsize and maxsize is the maximum value in the list `a`, mexsize is a positive integer that is not in the list `a` and is less than or equal to the maximum value in the list `a`. The value of mexsize is not explicitly provided, but it is described by the given information.

Output: **'Alice' if mexsize is odd, otherwise 'Bob' (where mexsize is the smallest positive integer that is not in the list `a` and is less than or equal to the maximum value in the list `a`)**
