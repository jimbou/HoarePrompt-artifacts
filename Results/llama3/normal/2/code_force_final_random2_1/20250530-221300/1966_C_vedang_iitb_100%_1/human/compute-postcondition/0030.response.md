To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state.

The loop head is `for sz in a:`, which means the loop will iterate over the elements of list `a`. Since `a` is a sorted list of positive integers with at least 2 elements, we can infer that the next element in the list will be the third element (since the second element is already processed).

The state at the end of the previous iteration is:

* `t` is a positive integer
* `tc` is 1
* `n` is a positive integer
* `a` is a sorted list of positive integers with at least 2 elements
* `sz` is the second element in `a`
* `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`
* `mexsize` is either increased by 1 (if `sz` is not equal to 2) or set to 4 (if `sz` is equal to 2)

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to update the values of `sz` and `mexsize` (if necessary).

Since `sz` is the second element in `a`, the next element in the list will be the third element. Let's call this new element `sz_new`. We can update the state as follows:

* `sz` becomes the third element in `a` (i.e., `sz_new`)
* If `sz_new` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is increased by 1 (if `sz_new` is not equal to 2), otherwise `mexsize` remains unchanged.

The other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `a`, and `maxsize`) do not need to be updated, as they are not directly affected by the loop iteration.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `tc` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers with at least 3 elements, `sz` is the third element in `a`, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `mexsize` is either increased by 1 (if `sz` is not equal to 2) or remains unchanged**
