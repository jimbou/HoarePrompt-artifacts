The code prints 'Alice' if the smallest positive integer that is not in the list a (mexsize) is odd, otherwise it prints 'Bob'. Since mexsize is less than or equal to maxsize, and maxsize is the maximum value in the sorted list a, mexsize is either the next integer after the last element in a (sz) or it is an integer that is missing from the list a.

Output: **'Alice' if mexsize is odd, 'Bob' if mexsize is even**
