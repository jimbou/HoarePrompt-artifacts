The only variable in the loop head is variable sz and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a. If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, sz is the last element in a. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and sz is the first element in the list.
State: **t is a positive integer, tc is 1, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, maxsize is the maximum value in a, mexsize is 1, sz is the first element in a**
