Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `tc` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`. If the first element of `a` is 1 and `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is 3 and `sz` is the second element in `a`. Otherwise, if the first element of `a` is 1 and `sz` is not equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is 2 and `sz` is the second element in `a`. If the first element of `a` is not 1, then `mexsize` is increased by 1 if `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, otherwise `mexsize` and `sz` remain unchanged.***
