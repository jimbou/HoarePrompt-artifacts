To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `sz` and `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `sz` is the second element in `a`. For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 3 elements. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `a` to have at least 3 elements.

The state of `sz` can be adjusted to be the third element in `a`.

The other variables `t`, `tc`, `stdin`, `n`, `maxsize`, and `mexsize` are not in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `tc` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers that must have at least 3 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `sz` is the third element in `a`, `mexsize` is 3 if the first element of `a` is 1 and `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, otherwise `mexsize` is 2 if the first element of `a` is 1 and `sz` is not equal to `mexsize`, otherwise `mexsize` is increased by 1 if `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, otherwise `mexsize` remains unchanged**
