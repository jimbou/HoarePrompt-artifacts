To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet.

The initial state provides the following information:

- `t` is a positive integer.
- `tc` is 1.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of positive integers.
- `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`.
- `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not in `a`.
- `sz` is the last element in `a`.
- The current value of `mexsize` is greater than the current value of `maxsize`.

The Python code snippet contains a `print` statement with a conditional expression:

```python
print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 0 else 'Bob')
```

This statement checks whether `mexsize` is even (i.e., `mexsize % 2 == 0`) and prints 'Alice' if it is, or 'Bob' if it is not.

Based on the initial state, we know that `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not in the list `a`, and its value is greater than `maxsize`. However, we do not have explicit values for `mexsize` or `maxsize`.

Since we cannot determine the exact value of `mexsize` or whether it is even or odd based on the provided information, we can only describe the output in terms of the condition.

Output: **'Alice' if mexsize is even, 'Bob' if mexsize is odd**
