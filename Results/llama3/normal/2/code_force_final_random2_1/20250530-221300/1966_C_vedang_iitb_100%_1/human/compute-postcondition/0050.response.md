To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for sz in a:`, which means we are iterating over the elements of the list `a`. The state at the end of the previous iteration is:

* `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2
* `tc` is 2
* `n` is a positive integer
* `a` is a sorted list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements
* `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`
* `sz` is the second element in the list `a`
* If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

* Since we are iterating over the elements of `a`, the next value of `sz` will be the next element in the list `a`.
* Since `a` is a sorted list, the next element will be greater than or equal to the current value of `sz`.
* The value of `maxsize` will not change, as it is the maximum value in `a`, which does not depend on the current iteration.
* The value of `mexsize` may change if the current value of `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, but this is not relevant to the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `sz` is the third element in the list `a`**

Note that we only adjusted the state of `sz`, as it is the only variable in the loop head that needs to be updated. The other variables remain unchanged.
