Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `tc` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `mexsize` is 2, and `sz` is equal to the first element of `a` which is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `mexsize` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `sz` is still equal to the first element of `a`, which is 1.
