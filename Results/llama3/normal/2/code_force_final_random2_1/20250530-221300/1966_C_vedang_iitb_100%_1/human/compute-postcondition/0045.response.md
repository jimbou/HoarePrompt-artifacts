Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `mexsize` is 2, and the current value of `sz` is still equal to 1, which is also the first element in the list `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `mexsize` has been incremented by 1, from 1 to 2. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties. The list `a` is still sorted and contains at least one positive integer, with `maxsize` being the maximum value in `a`. The value of `sz` remains equal to 1, which is also the first element in the list `a`.
