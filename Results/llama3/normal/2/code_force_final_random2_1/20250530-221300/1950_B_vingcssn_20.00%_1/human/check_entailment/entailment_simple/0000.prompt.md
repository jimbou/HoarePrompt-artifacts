Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n . Output a 2n \times 2n checkerboard made of 2
\times 2 squares alternating '\texttt{#} ' and '\texttt{.} ', with the top-
left cell being '\texttt{#} '.

The picture above shows the answers for n=1,2,3,4 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 20 ) — the number of test
cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20
) — it means you need to output a checkerboard of side length 2n .

Output

For each test case, output 2n lines, each containing 2n characters without
spaces — the checkerboard, as described in the statement. Do not output empty
lines between test cases.

Input

# Annotated Program:

        else:
            print('No esta en el rango')
        
    #State: `casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 and greater than or equal to 0, `c` is equal to `casos`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20, stdin contains 0 lines each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). If `n` is 1, '##' is printed. If `n` is 2, '##..' and '..##' are printed. If `n` is 3, '##..##', '..##..', '..##..', '##..##', and '##..##' are printed. If `n` is 4, '##..##..' and '..##..##' are printed eight times. If `n` is not 1, 2, 3, or 4, 'No esta en el rango' is printed.
