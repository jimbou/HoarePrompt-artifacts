Output State: **`casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 and greater than or equal to 0, `c` is equal to `casos`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20, stdin contains 0 lines each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). If `n` is 1, '##' is printed. If `n` is 2, '##..' and '..##' are printed. If `n` is 3, '##..##', '..##..', '..##..', '##..##', and '##..##' are printed. If `n` is 4, '##..##..' and '..##..##' are printed eight times. If `n` is not 1, 2, 3, or 4, 'No esta en el rango' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `casos` will be the same as the initial value, `c` will be equal to `casos`, and `n` will be the last integer read from stdin. The loop will have printed the corresponding patterns for each value of `n` read from stdin, and stdin will be empty.
