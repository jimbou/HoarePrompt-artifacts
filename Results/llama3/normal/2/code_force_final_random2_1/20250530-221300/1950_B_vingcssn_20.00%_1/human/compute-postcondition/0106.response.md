The only variable in the loop head is variable  c and casos, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c` and `casos`. If `c` is less than `casos`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 1 and `casos` is an integer between 2 and 20 and greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `c` must be increased by 1 so `c` is 2 and `casos` must be greater than 2.
State: **`casos` is an integer between 3 and 20 and greater than 2, `c` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20, stdin contains 16 lines each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20).**
