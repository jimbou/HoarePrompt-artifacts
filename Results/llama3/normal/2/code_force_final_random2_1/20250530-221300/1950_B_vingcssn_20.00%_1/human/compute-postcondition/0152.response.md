Postcondition: ***`casos` is an integer between 3 and 20 and greater than 2, `c` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20, stdin contains 15 lines each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). If `n` is 2, '##..' is printed, '..##' is printed, and '..##' is printed. If `n` is 3, '##..##' is printed, '..##..' is printed, '..##..' is printed, and '##..##' is printed, and '##..##' is printed. If `n` is 4, '##..##..' is printed six times, and '..##..##' is printed four times. Otherwise, 'No esta en el rango' is printed.***
