Postcondition: **`casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 and greater than 0, `c` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20, stdin contains 19 lines each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). If `n` is 1, '##' is printed. If `n` is 2, '##..' and '..##' are printed. If `n` is 3, '##..##', '..##..', '..##..', '##..##', and '##..##' are printed. If `n` is 4, '##..##..' and '..##..##' are printed eight times. If `n` is not 1, 2, 3, or 4, 'No esta en el rango' is printed.**
