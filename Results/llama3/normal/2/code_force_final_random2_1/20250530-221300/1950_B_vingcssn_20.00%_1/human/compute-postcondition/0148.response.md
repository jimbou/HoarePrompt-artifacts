Based on the initial state, the code will print the string 'No esta en el rango' because the value of `casos` is between 3 and 20 and greater than 2, and the value of `n` is between 1 and 20. The print statement is not dependent on the values of `casos`, `c`, or `n`, so it will always print the same string.

Output: **No esta en el rango**
