Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. It only handles the cases where n is 1, 2, 3, or 4, and for any other value of n, it prints "No esta en el rango" (which means "Not in the range" in Spanish). However, the problem description does not specify that n should only be in the range of 1 to 4. In fact, it states that n can be any integer between 1 and 20.

For example, if n is 5, the program should output a 10x10 checkerboard, but instead, it prints "No esta en el rango". This is a clear indication that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
