The code accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `n`. The stdin contains 20 lines each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). Since one line is read, 19 lines are left in the stdin. The value of `casos` is not affected, so it is still an integer between 1 and 20 and greater than 0. The value of `c` is also not affected, so it is still 0. 

Output State: **`casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 and greater than 0, `c` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20, stdin contains 19 lines each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20)**
