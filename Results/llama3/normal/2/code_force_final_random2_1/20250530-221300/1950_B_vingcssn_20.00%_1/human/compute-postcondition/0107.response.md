Output State: **`casos` is an integer between 3 and 20 and greater than 2, `c` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20, stdin contains 15 lines each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20).**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to an integer between 1 and 20, which is the input from the first line of stdin. The values of `casos` and `c` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains 15 lines, as one line has been consumed to read the value of `n`.
