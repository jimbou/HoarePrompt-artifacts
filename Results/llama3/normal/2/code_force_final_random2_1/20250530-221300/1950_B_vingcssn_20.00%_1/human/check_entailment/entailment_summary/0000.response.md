Reasoning: 
The given program is incorrect because it only handles specific cases for n = 1, 2, 3, and 4. It does not provide a general solution for any n within the given range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). For n > 4, it prints 'No esta en el rango' instead of generating the correct checkerboard pattern. A correct solution should be able to generate the checkerboard pattern for any n within the specified range.

Correctness: **False**
