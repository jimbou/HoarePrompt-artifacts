Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly generate the checkerboard pattern for all values of n between 1 and 20. The program only handles specific cases for n = 1, 2, 3, and 4, and prints a message "No esta en el rango" for any other value of n. However, the problem statement requires the program to generate the checkerboard pattern for all values of n between 1 and 20.

The program should use a loop to generate the pattern for any value of n, rather than hardcoding specific cases. The correct approach would be to use nested loops to generate the 2n x 2n checkerboard pattern, alternating between '#' and '.' characters.

Correctness: **False**
