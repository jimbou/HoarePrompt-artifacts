Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints a specific pattern of '#' and '.' characters based on the value of `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints two lines of '##'. If `n` is 2, it prints four lines of '##..' and '..##'. If `n` is 3, it prints six lines of '##..##', '..##..', and '##..##'. If `n` is 4, it prints eight lines of '##..##..' and '..##..##'. If `n` is not between 1 and 4, it prints 'No esta en el rango'. The function repeats this process for all `t` test cases.**
