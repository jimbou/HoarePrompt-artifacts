The value of `n` is assigned the value of an integer from the input, where `input()` accepts an integer and `int` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains 18 lines each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) first and that integer is assigned into n. So stdin now contains 17 lines each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`casos` is an integer between 2 and 20 and greater than 1, `c` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20, stdin contains 17 lines each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20)**
