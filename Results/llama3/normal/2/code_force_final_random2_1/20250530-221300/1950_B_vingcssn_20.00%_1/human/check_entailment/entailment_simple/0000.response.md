Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle all possible values of `n` between 1 and 20. The program only handles the cases where `n` is 1, 2, 3, or 4, and for all other values of `n`, it prints 'No esta en el rango'. However, the problem statement requires the program to output a 2n x 2n checkerboard for all values of `n` between 1 and 20.

The program should use a loop to generate the checkerboard pattern for all values of `n`, rather than hardcoding the output for specific values of `n`.

Correctness: **False**
