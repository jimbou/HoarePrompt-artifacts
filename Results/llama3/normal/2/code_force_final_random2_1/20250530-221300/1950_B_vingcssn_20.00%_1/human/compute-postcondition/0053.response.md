Postcondition: ***`casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 and greater than 0, `c` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20 and not equal to 1, stdin contains 19 lines each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and `n` is not equal to 2, and `n` is not equal to 3. If `n` is equal to 4, then '##..##..' is being printed eight times, and '..##..##' is being printed eight times. If `n` is not equal to 4, then the string 'No esta en el rango' is being printed.***
