Reasoning:

The given program is designed to output a 2n x 2n checkerboard made of 2x2 squares alternating '#' and '.' characters, with the top-left cell being '#'. The program takes an integer n as input and outputs the corresponding checkerboard.

However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the program only handles specific cases for n = 1, 2, 3, and 4. For any other value of n, the program prints 'No esta en el rango' (which translates to 'Not in the range').

This is a clear indication that the program is incomplete and does not correctly handle all possible inputs within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). The program should be able to generate the checkerboard for any value of n within this range, not just the specific cases that are hardcoded.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the given program, it is clear that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
