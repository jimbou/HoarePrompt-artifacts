Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is t-1, n is an integer, s is a string without 'map' and 'pie', m is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original string, p is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the string without 'map', stdin contains 0 test cases, and the sum of the number of occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' which is m+p is being printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has executed for all test cases (t times), and the loop variable i has reached its final value of t-1. The string s has been processed to remove all occurrences of 'map' and 'pie', and the counts of 'map' and 'pie' have been calculated and printed. The input stream (stdin) is now empty, as all test cases have been processed.
