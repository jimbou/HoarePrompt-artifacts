Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the string contains overlapping substrings "map" and "pie". For example, if the input string is "mapie", the program will count it as two separate substrings and print 2, but the correct output should be 1 because only one character needs to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

The program replaces all occurrences of "map" with an empty string, and then counts the occurrences of "pie" in the resulting string. However, this approach does not consider the case where "map" and "pie" overlap. A correct solution would need to handle this case by checking for overlapping substrings and counting them correctly.
