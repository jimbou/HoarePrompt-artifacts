Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a string s. It then counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the string, removes these substrings from the string, and prints the total count of 'map' and 'pie' occurrences. The function processes all test cases and outputs the total count for each case, leaving the input string without 'map' and 'pie' substrings.**
