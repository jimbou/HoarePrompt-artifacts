To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `t` is an integer and stdin contains `t-1` test cases, we can infer that `t` must be greater than 0.

Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer, but we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1. We also need to initialize `i` to 0, as it will be the starting value for the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` test cases**
