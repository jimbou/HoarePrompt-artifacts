Based on the initial state, the code will print the sum of the number of occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the original string.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

* `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original string.
* `p` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the string without 'map'. This means that the string has already been modified to remove 'map', so `p` only counts the occurrences of 'pie' in the modified string.
* The `print` statement simply adds `m` and `p` together.

Since `m` and `p` are both counts of occurrences of specific substrings, their values are integers. Therefore, the sum `m + p` is also an integer.

Output: **the sum of the number of occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the original string**
