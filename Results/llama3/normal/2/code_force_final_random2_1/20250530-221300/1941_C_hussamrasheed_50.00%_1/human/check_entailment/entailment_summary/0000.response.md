Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the input string, removes these substrings from the string, and prints the total count of 'map' and 'pie' occurrences. This is in line with the problem description, which requires the minimum number of characters to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
