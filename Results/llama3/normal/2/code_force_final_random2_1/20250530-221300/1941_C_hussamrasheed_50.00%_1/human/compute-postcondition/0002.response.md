Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer, s is a string without 'map', m is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original string, p is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the string without 'map', stdin contains t-2 test cases**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

After executing the code, the value of `t` remains unchanged as an integer greater than 0. The value of `i` also remains unchanged at 0. The variable `n` is assigned an integer value from the input, which is one of the `t-1` test cases. The string `s` is initially assigned a value from the input, but then all occurrences of 'map' are removed from it. The variable `m` is assigned the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original string `s`. Finally, the variable `p` is assigned the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the modified string `s` without 'map'. The stdin now contains `t-2` test cases, as two inputs have been consumed by the code.
