Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, n is an integer, s is a string without 'map' and 'pie', m is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original string, p is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the string without 'map', stdin contains t-6 test cases, and the sum of the number of occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' which is m+p is being printed**

The code snippet executes as follows:

1. The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by 1, making it `t-6`.

2. The second line reads a string from stdin and assigns it to `s`. This string does not contain 'map' and 'pie'.

3. The third line counts the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original string `s` and assigns it to `m`.

4. The fourth line replaces all occurrences of 'map' in `s` with an empty string, effectively removing 'map' from `s`.

5. The fifth line counts the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the modified string `s` (which does not contain 'map') and assigns it to `p`.

After executing all the lines, the state of the variables is as follows:

- `t` remains an integer greater than 2.
- `i` remains 2.
- `n` is now an integer read from stdin.
- `s` is a string without 'map' and 'pie'.
- `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original string.
- `p` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the string without 'map'.
- `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases.
- The sum of the number of occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' which is `m+p` is being printed.
