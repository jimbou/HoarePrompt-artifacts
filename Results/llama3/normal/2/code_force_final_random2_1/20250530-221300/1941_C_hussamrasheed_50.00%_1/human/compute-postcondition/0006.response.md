Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, i is 1, n is an integer, s is a string without 'map' and 'pie', m is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original string, p is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the string without 'map', stdin contains t-4 test cases.**

The code snippet reads an integer `n` from stdin and assigns it to the variable `n`. It then reads a string `s` from stdin and assigns it to the variable `s`. The number of occurrences of 'map' in the original string `s` is counted and assigned to the variable `m`. The string `s` is then modified by replacing all occurrences of 'map' with an empty string, effectively removing 'map' from `s`. Finally, the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the modified string `s` is counted and assigned to the variable `p`. The variables `t` and `i` are not modified by the code. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 2.
