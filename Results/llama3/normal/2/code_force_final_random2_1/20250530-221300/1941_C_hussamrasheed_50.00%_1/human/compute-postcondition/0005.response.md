To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `t` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. Since `t` is an integer greater than 0, it remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string without 'map', `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original string, `p` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the string without 'map', stdin contains t-3 test cases, and the sum of the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original string and the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the string without 'map' is printed**
