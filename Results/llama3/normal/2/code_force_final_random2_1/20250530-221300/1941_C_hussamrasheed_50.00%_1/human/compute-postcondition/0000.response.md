The code `t = int(input())` accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^6) and then a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The first input is assigned into t. So stdin now contains t-1 test cases. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^6) and then a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
Output State: **`t` is an integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^6) and then a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.**
