Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There are 𝑛 lamps numbered 1 to 𝑛 lined up in a row, initially turned off. You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): Choose two non-adjacent† lamps that are currently turned off, then turn them on. Determine whether you can reach configuration 𝑠, where 𝑠𝑖=1 means the 𝑖-th lamp is turned on, and 𝑠𝑖=0 otherwise. † Only lamp 𝑖 and 𝑖+1 are adjacent for all 1≤𝑖<𝑛. Note that lamp 𝑛 and 1 are not adjacent when 𝑛≠2. Input: Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤1000) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer 𝑛 (1≤𝑛≤50) — the number of lamps. The second line of each test case contains a binary string 𝑠 of size 𝑛 — the final desired configuration. Output: For each test case, print on one line "YES" if we can reach the configuration 𝑠 via applying the given operation any number of times. Otherwise, print "NO".

# Annotated Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (between 1 and 1000) and then a binary string of the same length as the integer.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        cnt1 = s.count('1')
        
        if cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        elif cnt1 > 2 and (cnt1 % 2 == 1 or cnt1 == 1):
            print('NO')
        elif '11' in s:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: t is 0, n is an integer equal to the input value, s is a binary string of the same length as n, cnt1 is the number of '1's in s, stdin contains no test cases. If cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 is even, 'YES' is printed. If cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 is odd or cnt1 is 1, 'NO' is printed. If '11' is in s, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines whether a given binary string meets certain conditions and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The function accepts multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a binary string of the same length. It counts the number of '1's in the binary string and checks if the count is greater than 2 and even, or if the string contains consecutive '1's. Based on these conditions, it prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.
