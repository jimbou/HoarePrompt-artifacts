Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a given binary string can be reached by performing a specific operation on a row of lamps. The operation involves choosing two non-adjacent lamps that are currently turned off and turning them on.

The program correctly handles multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a binary string of the same length. It counts the number of '1's in the binary string and checks if the count is greater than 2 and even, or if the string contains consecutive '1's.

The program's logic is based on the following rules:

1. If the count of '1's is greater than 2 and even, it prints 'YES', indicating that the configuration can be reached.
2. If the count of '1's is greater than 2 and odd, or if the count is 1, it prints 'NO', indicating that the configuration cannot be reached.
3. If the string contains consecutive '1's, it prints 'NO', indicating that the configuration cannot be reached.
4. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', indicating that the configuration can be reached.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
