Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, n is an integer, s is a binary string of the same length as n, cnt1 is the number of '1's in s, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

After executing the code, the value of `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 1000. The value of `n` is now an integer that was inputted from stdin, and the value of `s` is a binary string of the same length as `n`, also inputted from stdin. The variable `cnt1` now holds the count of '1's in the binary string `s`. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, as two inputs have been consumed by the code.
