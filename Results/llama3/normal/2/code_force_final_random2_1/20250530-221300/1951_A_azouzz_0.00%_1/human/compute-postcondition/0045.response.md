Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 0 and 998, n is an integer equal to the input value, s is a binary string of the same length as n, cnt1 is the number of '1's in s, stdin contains multiple test cases minus six test cases. If cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 is even, 'YES' is printed. If cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 is odd or cnt1 is 1, 'NO' is printed. If '11' is in s, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.***
