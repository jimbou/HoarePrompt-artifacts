Functionality: **Determines whether a given binary string meets certain conditions and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The function accepts multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a binary string of the same length. It counts the number of '1's in the binary string and checks if the count is greater than 2 and even, or if the string contains consecutive '1's. Based on these conditions, it prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.**
