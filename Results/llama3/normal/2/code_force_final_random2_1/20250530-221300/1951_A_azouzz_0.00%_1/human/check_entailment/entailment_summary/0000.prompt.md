Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
There are 𝑛 lamps numbered 1 to 𝑛 lined up in a row, initially turned off. You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): Choose two non-adjacent† lamps that are currently turned off, then turn them on. Determine whether you can reach configuration 𝑠, where 𝑠𝑖=1 means the 𝑖-th lamp is turned on, and 𝑠𝑖=0 otherwise. † Only lamp 𝑖 and 𝑖+1 are adjacent for all 1≤𝑖<𝑛. Note that lamp 𝑛 and 1 are not adjacent when 𝑛≠2. Input: Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤1000) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer 𝑛 (1≤𝑛≤50) — the number of lamps. The second line of each test case contains a binary string 𝑠 of size 𝑛 — the final desired configuration. Output: For each test case, print on one line "YES" if we can reach the configuration 𝑠 via applying the given operation any number of times. Otherwise, print "NO".

# Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        cnt1 = s.count('1')
        if cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        elif cnt1 > 2 and (cnt1 % 2 == 1 or cnt1 == 1):
            print('NO')
        elif '11' in s:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')





# Execution Summary:
Determines whether a given binary string meets certain conditions and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The function accepts multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a binary string of the same length. It counts the number of '1's in the binary string and checks if the count is greater than 2 and even, or if the string contains consecutive '1's. Based on these conditions, it prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.
