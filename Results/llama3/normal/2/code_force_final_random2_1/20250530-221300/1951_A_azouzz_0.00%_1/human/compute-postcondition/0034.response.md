Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 998, n is an integer equal to the input value, s is a binary string of the same length as n, cnt1 is the number of '1's in s, stdin contains multiple test cases minus six test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `n` is updated to the input value, which is an integer. The value of `s` is also updated to a binary string of the same length as `n`. The value of `cnt1` is updated to the number of '1's in the binary string `s`. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by one, as one test case is consumed by the `input()` function.
