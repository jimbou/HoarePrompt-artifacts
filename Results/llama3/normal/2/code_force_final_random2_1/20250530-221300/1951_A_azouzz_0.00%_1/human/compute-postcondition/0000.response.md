Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains one input: a binary string of the same length as the integer that was inputted before this binary string.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first integer input from stdin, which is between 1 and 1000. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains one input: a binary string of the same length as the integer that was inputted before this binary string.
