Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 999, n is an integer equal to the input value, s is a binary string of the same length as n, cnt1 is the number of '1's in s, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the input value from stdin, and `s` is now a binary string of the same length as `n`. The value of `cnt1` has also been updated to the number of '1's in the string `s`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and stdin now contains one less test case.
