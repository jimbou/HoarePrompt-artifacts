The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decreased by 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 999, `n` is an integer, `s` is a binary string of the same length as `n`, `cnt1` is the number of '1's in `s`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and is an even number, 'YES' is being printed. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and is an odd number, 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, if the string `s` contains the substring '11', then 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is being printed.**
