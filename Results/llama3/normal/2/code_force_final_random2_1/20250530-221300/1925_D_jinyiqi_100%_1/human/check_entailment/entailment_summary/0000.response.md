Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly reads the input, calculates the sum of all friendship values, and then uses this sum to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The program also correctly handles the modular arithmetic operation to find the result modulo 10^9+7.

The program uses the formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values, which is derived from the problem description. The formula is:

E(sum of friendship values) = (2 \* k \* n \* (n-1) / 2 \* sum of friendship values + m \* k \* (k-1)) / (2 \* (n \* (n-1) / 2)^2)

The program correctly calculates the numerator and denominator of this formula, and then uses the math.gcd function to find the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator. It then divides both the numerator and denominator by the greatest common divisor to simplify the fraction.

Finally, the program uses the pow function to calculate the modular inverse of the denominator modulo 10^9+7, and then multiplies the numerator by this modular inverse to find the result modulo 10^9+7.

Correctness: **True**
