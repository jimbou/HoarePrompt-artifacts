In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the final values of the variables are: t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, M is 1000000007, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), m is an integer between 0 and min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2) (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 (inclusive), sum_f is the sum of all f values from the input, a is an integer, b is an integer, f is an integer, j is m, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains multiple lines minus one, cn2 is n*(n-1)/2, p is (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) divided by the greatest common divisor of (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) and (2*cn2^2), q is (2*cn2^2) divided by the greatest common divisor of (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) and (2*cn2^2), gcd is the greatest common divisor of (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) and (2*cn2^2), and the result of the modular arithmetic operation int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M) is being printed, i is t-1, and this is printed: the result of the modular arithmetic operation int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M) which is equal to int(((2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) / gcd) * pow((2*cn2^2)/gcd, -1, M) % M).
