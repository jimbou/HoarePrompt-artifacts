Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, M is 1000000007, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), m is an integer between 0 and min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2) (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 (inclusive), sum_f is 0, a is an integer, b is an integer, f is an integer, j is m-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains multiple lines minus one, cn2 is n*(n-1)/2, p is (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) divided by the greatest common divisor of (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) and (2*cn2^2), q is (2*cn2^2) divided by the greatest common divisor of (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) and (2*cn2^2), gcd is the greatest common divisor of (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) and (2*cn2^2), and the result of the modular arithmetic operation int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M) is being printed, i is 1**

The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. It then initializes `sum_f` to 0. The values of `t`, `M`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `j`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, `gcd`, and `i` remain unchanged. The input state is updated to reflect that one test case has been processed.
