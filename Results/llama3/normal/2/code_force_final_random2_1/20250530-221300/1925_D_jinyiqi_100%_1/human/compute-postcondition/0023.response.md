The code prints the result of the modular arithmetic operation `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)`, where `p` is `(2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1))` divided by the greatest common divisor of `(2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1))` and `(2*cn2^2)`, `q` is `(2*cn2^2)` divided by the greatest common divisor of `(2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1))` and `(2*cn2^2)`, and `M` is `1000000007`.

Since the exact values of `k`, `cn2`, `sum_f`, `m`, and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the modular arithmetic operation.

Output: **the result of the modular arithmetic operation int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M) (where p, q, and M are defined as above)**
