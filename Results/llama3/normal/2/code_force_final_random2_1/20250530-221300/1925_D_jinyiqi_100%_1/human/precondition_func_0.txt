stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains multiple lines. The first line contains three integers: n, m, and k. The next m lines contain three integers each: a_i, b_i, and f_i. n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), m is an integer between 0 and min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2) (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 (inclusive), a_i and b_i are integers between 1 and n (inclusive), and f_i is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
