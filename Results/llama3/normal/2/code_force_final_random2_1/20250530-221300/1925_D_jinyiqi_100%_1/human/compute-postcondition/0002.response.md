Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, M is 1000000007, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), m is an integer between 0 and min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2) (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 (inclusive), sum_f is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains multiple lines minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `M` also remains the same. The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`, respectively. The value of `sum_f` is initialized to 0. The state of `stdin` is updated to reflect that one line of input has been consumed.
