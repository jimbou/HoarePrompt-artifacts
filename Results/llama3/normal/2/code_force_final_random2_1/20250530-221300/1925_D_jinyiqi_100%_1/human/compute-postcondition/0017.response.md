The only variable in the loop head is variable j and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j and m. If j is less than m, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 0, m is an integer between 1 and min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2) (inclusive). For the loop to execute again j must be increased by 1 so j is 1 and for the loop to execute again m must be greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer greater than 1, M is 1000000007, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), m is an integer between 2 and min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2) (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 (inclusive), sum_f is the previous value of sum_f plus f, a is an integer, b is an integer, f is an integer, j is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains multiple lines minus one, cn2 is n*(n-1)/2, p is (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) divided by the greatest common divisor of (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) and (2*cn2^2), q is (2*cn2^2) divided by the greatest common divisor of (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) and (2*cn2^2), gcd is the greatest common divisor of (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) and (2*cn2^2), and the result of the modular arithmetic operation int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M) is being printed, i is 1**
