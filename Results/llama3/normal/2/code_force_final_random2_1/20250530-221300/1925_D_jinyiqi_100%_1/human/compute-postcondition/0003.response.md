The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If m is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is an integer greater than 0, M is 1000000007, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), m is an integer between 0 and min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2) (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 (inclusive), sum_f is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains multiple lines minus one. So for the loop to be executed  the m must be greater than 0 and j is 0.
State: **t is an integer greater than 0, M is 1000000007, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2) (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 (inclusive), sum_f is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains multiple lines minus one, j is 0**
