Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, M is 1000000007, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), m is an integer between 0 and min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2) (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 (inclusive), sum_f is equal to the original value of sum_f plus the sum of all f values, a is an integer, b is an integer, f is an integer, j is m-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains multiple lines minus one**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for t, M, n, and k as in the initial state. The value of m will be between 0 and the minimum of 10^5 and n*(n-1)/2 (inclusive), because the loop will have executed m times. The value of sum_f will be the original value of sum_f plus the sum of all f values read from the input during the loop executions. The values of a, b, and f will be the last values read from the input during the loop executions. The value of j will be m-1, because the loop will have executed m times and the loop variable j starts at 0. The state of the input (stdin) will be the same as in the initial state, with multiple test cases minus one, each containing multiple lines minus one.
