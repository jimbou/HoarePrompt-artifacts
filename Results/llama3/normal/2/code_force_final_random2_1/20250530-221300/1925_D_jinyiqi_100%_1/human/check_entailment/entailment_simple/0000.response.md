Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The program correctly reads the input, calculates the sum of friendship values, and then calculates the expected value using the formula provided in the problem description.

The program uses the `math.gcd` function to calculate the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator of the expected value, which is necessary to simplify the fraction and avoid overflow. The program then uses the `pow` function with three arguments to calculate the modular inverse of the denominator, which is necessary to calculate the expected value modulo 10^9 + 7.

The program correctly handles the case where there are no pairs of friends (i.e., m = 0) by setting the sum of friendship values to 0. The program also correctly handles the case where there is only one pair of friends (i.e., m = 1) by calculating the expected value as the sum of the friendship values of the pair.

The program's use of variables and data structures is clear and concise, and the program's logic is easy to follow. The program's use of comments is also helpful in understanding the program's logic.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, I conclude that the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
