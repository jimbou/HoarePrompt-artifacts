Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 2, M is 1000000007, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), m is an integer between 0 and min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2) (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 (inclusive), sum_f is 0, a is an integer, b is an integer, f is an integer, j is m, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains multiple lines minus one, cn2 is n*(n-1)/2, p is (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) divided by the greatest common divisor of (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) and (2*cn2^2), q is (2*cn2^2) divided by the greatest common divisor of (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) and (2*cn2^2), gcd is the greatest common divisor of (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) and (2*cn2^2), and the result of the modular arithmetic operation int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M) is being printed, i is 2, and this is printed: the result of the modular arithmetic operation int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M) which is equal to int(((2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) / gcd) * pow((2*cn2^2)/gcd, -1, M) % M)
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    a, b, f = map(int, input().split())
    sum_f += f


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 2, M is 1000000007, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2) (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 (inclusive), sum_f is equal to its original value plus f, a is an integer equal to the first integer from stdin, b is an integer equal to the second integer from stdin, f is an integer equal to the third integer from stdin, j is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains multiple lines minus one, cn2 is n*(n-1)/2, p is (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) divided by the greatest common divisor of (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) and (2*cn2^2), q is (2*cn2^2) divided by the greatest common divisor of (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) and (2*cn2^2), gcd is the greatest common divisor of (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) and (2*cn2^2), and the result of the modular arithmetic operation int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M) is being printed, i is 2, and this is printed: the result of the modular arithmetic operation int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M) which is equal to int(((2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) / gcd) * pow((2*cn2^2)/gcd, -1, M) % M)

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than 2, M is 1000000007, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), m is an integer between 2 and min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2) (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 (inclusive), sum_f is equal to its original value plus f, a is an integer equal to the first integer from stdin, b is an integer equal to the second integer from stdin, f is an integer equal to the third integer from stdin, j is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains multiple lines minus one, cn2 is n*(n-1)/2, p is (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) divided by the greatest common divisor of (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) and (2*cn2^2), q is (2*cn2^2) divided by the greatest common divisor of (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) and (2*cn2^2), gcd is the greatest common divisor of (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) and (2*cn2^2), and the result of the modular arithmetic operation int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M) is being printed, i is 2, and this is printed: the result of the modular arithmetic operation int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M) which is equal to int(((2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) / gcd) * pow((2*cn2^2)/gcd, -1, M) % M).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer greater than 2, M is 1000000007, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), m is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2) (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 (inclusive), sum_f is equal to its original value plus f, a is an integer equal to the first integer from stdin, b is an integer equal to the second integer from stdin, f is an integer equal to the third integer from stdin, j is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains multiple lines minus one, cn2 is n*(n-1)/2, p is (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) divided by the greatest common divisor of (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) and (2*cn2^2), q is (2*cn2^2) divided by the greatest common divisor of (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) and (2*cn2^2), gcd is the greatest common divisor of (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) and (2*cn2^2), and the result of the modular arithmetic operation int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M) is being printed, i is 2, and this is printed: the result of the modular arithmetic operation int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M) which is equal to int(((2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) / gcd) * pow((2*cn2^2)/gcd, -1, M) % M)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
