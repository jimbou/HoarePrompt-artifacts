The code prints the integer value of `p` multiplied by the modular multiplicative inverse of `q` modulo `M`, where `p` is the quotient of `(2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1))` divided by the greatest common divisor of `(2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1))` and `(2*cn2^2)`, `q` is the quotient of `(2*cn2^2)` divided by the greatest common divisor of `(2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1))` and `(2*cn2^2)`, and `M` is 1000000007.

Output: **(p * q^(-1)) mod M (where p is the quotient of (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) divided by the greatest common divisor of (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) and (2*cn2^2), q is the quotient of (2*cn2^2) divided by the greatest common divisor of (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) and (2*cn2^2), and M is 1000000007)**
