This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing multiple lines. For each test case, it reads three integers (n, m, and k) and then m lines, each containing three integers (a, b, and f). It calculates the sum of all f values and uses this sum, along with n, m, and k, to compute two values (p and q) and their greatest common divisor (gcd). The function then prints the result of a modular arithmetic operation involving p, q, and gcd for each test case.
