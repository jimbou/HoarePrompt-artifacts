Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, M is 1000000007, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2) (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 (inclusive), sum_f is equal to the original value of sum_f plus f, a is an integer, b is an integer, f is an integer, j is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains multiple lines minus one**

The code snippet reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `f` from the input and assigns them to the corresponding variables. It then increments the value of `sum_f` by the value of `f`. The values of `t`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged. The input state is updated to reflect that one test case has been processed, leaving multiple test cases minus one, each containing multiple lines minus one.
