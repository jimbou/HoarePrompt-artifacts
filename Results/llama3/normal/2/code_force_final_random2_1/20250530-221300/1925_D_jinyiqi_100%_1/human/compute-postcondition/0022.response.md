The code snippet modifies the values of `cn2`, `p`, `q`, and `gcd`. The first line calculates the value of `cn2` as `n*(n-1)/2`, which is a new variable introduced by the code. The second line calculates the value of `p` as `2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)`, which is a new variable introduced by the code. The third line calculates the value of `q` as `2*cn2**2`, which is a new variable introduced by the code. The fourth line calculates the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q` and assigns it to `gcd`, which is a new variable introduced by the code. The fifth and sixth lines divide `p` and `q` by `gcd`, respectively, updating their values. The seventh line is a no-op, so it does not affect any variables.
