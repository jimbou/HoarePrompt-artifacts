Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, M is 1000000007, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), m is an integer between 0 and min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2) (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 (inclusive), sum_f is the sum of all f values from the input, a is an integer, b is an integer, f is an integer, j is m, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains multiple lines minus one, cn2 is n*(n-1)/2, p is (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) divided by the greatest common divisor of (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) and (2*cn2^2), q is (2*cn2^2) divided by the greatest common divisor of (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) and (2*cn2^2), gcd is the greatest common divisor of (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) and (2*cn2^2), and the result of the modular arithmetic operation int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M) is being printed, i is 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the input values for 'a', 'b', and 'f', and the variable 'sum_f' now holds the sum of all the 'f' values. The loop counter 'j' has reached its final value 'm', and the other variables remain unchanged.
