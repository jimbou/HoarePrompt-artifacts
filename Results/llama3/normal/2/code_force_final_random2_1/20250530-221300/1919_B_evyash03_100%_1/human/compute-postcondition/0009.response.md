Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" that must have at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in the `expression`, `length` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3. If `char` is '+', then `count` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `count` is either 1 or 2.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1. If `char` is '+', then `count` was either 1 or 2 initially, so it is now either 2 or 3. If `char` is '-', then `count` was either 0 or 1 initially, so it is now either 1 or 2. The values of `expression`, `char`, and `length` remain unchanged.
