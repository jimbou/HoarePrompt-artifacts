To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `char` and `expression`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `expression`. If the `expression` has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is 0. So for the loop to be executed, the `expression` must have at least 1 character and the `char` is the first character in the `expression`.

State: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" that must have at least 1 character, `char` is the first character in the `expression`, `length` is a positive integer equal to the length of `expression`, `count` is 0**
