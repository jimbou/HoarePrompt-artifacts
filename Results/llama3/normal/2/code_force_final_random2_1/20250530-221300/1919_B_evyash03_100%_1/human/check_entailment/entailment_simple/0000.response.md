Reasoning:

The problem asks to find the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty of each subarray. The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `expression` and an integer `length` as input. The function iterates over the characters in the string, increments a counter `count` for each '+' character, and then calculates the number of '-' characters by subtracting `count` from `length`. Finally, it returns the absolute difference between the number of '-' characters and the number of '+' characters.

The program's logic is correct because it effectively calculates the minimum possible penalty by considering the optimal way to split the array. The optimal way to split the array is to group all '+' characters together and all '-' characters together, which results in two subarrays with sums equal to the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters, respectively. The penalty of each subarray is then the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, which is equal to the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters.

Therefore, the program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty.

Correctness: **True**
