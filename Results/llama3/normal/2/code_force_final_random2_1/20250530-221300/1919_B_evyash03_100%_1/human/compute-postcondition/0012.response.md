Output State: **expression is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" of length equal to the value of length, char is the last character in the expression, length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression, sub is equal to the number of '-' characters in expression if char is '+', otherwise sub is equal to the number of '-' characters in expression plus 1, count is equal to the number of '+' characters in expression if char is '+', otherwise count is equal to the number of '+' characters in expression minus 1.**

In this output state, the value of `sub` is calculated based on the value of `length` and `count`. If `char` is '+', then `sub` is equal to the number of '-' characters in `expression`, which is `length - count`. If `char` is '-', then `sub` is equal to the number of '-' characters in `expression` plus 1, which is `length - (count - 1)`. The values of `expression`, `char`, `length`, and `count` remain the same as in the initial state.
