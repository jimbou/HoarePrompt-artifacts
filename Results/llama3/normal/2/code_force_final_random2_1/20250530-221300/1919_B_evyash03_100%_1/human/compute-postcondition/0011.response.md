Output State: **expression is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" of length equal to the value of length, char is the last character in the expression, length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression. If char is '+', then count is equal to the number of '+' characters in expression. Otherwise, count is equal to the number of '+' characters in expression minus 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the expression remains unchanged, the character variable points to the last character in the expression, the length variable remains equal to the length of the expression, and the count variable is equal to the total number of '+' characters in the expression.
