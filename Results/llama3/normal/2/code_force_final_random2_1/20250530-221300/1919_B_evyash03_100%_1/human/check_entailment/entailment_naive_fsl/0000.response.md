Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array into subarrays with equal numbers of '+' and '-' characters. The function `func_1` takes the expression and its length as input, counts the number of '+' characters, and then calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters. This difference represents the minimum possible penalty.

The program works correctly for all potential cases because it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It splits the array into subarrays with equal numbers of '+' and '-' characters, which minimizes the penalty. The program also handles edge cases, such as when the input expression contains only '+' or only '-' characters, or when the length of the expression is 1.

The program's correctness can be verified by testing it with various inputs, including the examples provided in the problem statement. For instance, when the input is "+", the program correctly outputs 1, which is the minimum possible penalty. Similarly, when the input is "-----", the program correctly outputs 5, which is the minimum possible penalty.

In summary, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all potential cases, including edge cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
