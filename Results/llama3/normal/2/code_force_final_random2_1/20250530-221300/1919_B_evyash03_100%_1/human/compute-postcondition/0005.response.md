To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables in the loop head and how they change.

The loop head is `for char in expression:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `char` and `expression`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" that must have at least 1 character, `char` is the first character in the `expression`, and `length` is a positive integer equal to the length of `expression`.

For the loop to execute again, `expression` must have at least one more character. Since `char` is the first character in the `expression`, it will be the next character in the `expression` for the next iteration. Therefore, `char` will be the second character in the `expression`.

The state of `length` is not directly related to the loop head, so we cannot adjust it. However, since `expression` must have at least one more character, `length` will be at least 2.

The state of `count` is not related to the loop head, so we cannot adjust it.

State: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" that must have at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in the `expression`, `length` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `count` is either 0 or 1**
