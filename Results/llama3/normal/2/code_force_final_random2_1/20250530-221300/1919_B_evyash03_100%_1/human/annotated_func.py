#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression.
    count = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            count += 1
        
    #State: expression is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" of length equal to the value of length, char is the last character in the expression, length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression. If char is '+', then count is equal to the number of '+' characters in expression. Otherwise, count is equal to the number of '+' characters in expression minus 1.
    sub = length - count
    return abs(sub - count)
    #The program returns the absolute difference between the number of '-' characters in the expression and the number of '+' characters in the expression, considering the last character in the expression.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in a given string expression, taking into account the last character in the expression. It accepts a string expression as input and returns a non-negative integer value representing the difference.
