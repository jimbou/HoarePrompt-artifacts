Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.

3. The function `func_1` is called with the string `s` and its length `n` as arguments.

4. Inside the function `func_1`, it initializes a variable `count` to 0 and then iterates over each character in the string `s`. If the character is '+', it increments the `count` variable.

5. After the loop, it calculates the number of '-' characters in the string by subtracting the `count` from the length of the string `n`. This is stored in the variable `sub`.

6. Finally, it returns the absolute difference between `sub` and `count`, which represents the minimum possible penalty.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and calculates the minimum possible penalty by taking the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters.

Correctness: **True**
