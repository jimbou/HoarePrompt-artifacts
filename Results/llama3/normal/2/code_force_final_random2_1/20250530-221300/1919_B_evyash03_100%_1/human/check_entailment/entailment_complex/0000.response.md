Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `expression` and an integer `length` as input. The function iterates through the characters in the string, incrementing a counter `count` whenever it encounters a '+' character. After the loop, it calculates the number of '-' characters in the string by subtracting `count` from `length`. Finally, it returns the absolute difference between the number of '-' characters and the number of '+' characters.

The key insight here is that the optimal way to split the array is to group consecutive '+' characters together and consecutive '-' characters together. This is because the penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, so grouping consecutive '+' characters together will result in a subarray with a positive sum, and grouping consecutive '-' characters together will result in a subarray with a negative sum. By doing so, the total penalty will be minimized.

The given program correctly implements this insight by counting the number of '+' characters and '-' characters in the string and returning the absolute difference between them. Therefore, the program is correct.
