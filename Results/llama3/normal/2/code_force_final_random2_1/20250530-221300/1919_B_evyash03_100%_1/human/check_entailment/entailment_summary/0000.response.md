Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by finding the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the given string expression. This is because the optimal way to split the array is to group consecutive '+' and '-' characters together, and the penalty is the absolute value of the sum of each group multiplied by its length. By finding the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, the program effectively calculates the minimum possible penalty.

Correctness: **True**
