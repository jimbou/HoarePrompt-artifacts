Output State: **The program returns the absolute difference between the number of '-' characters in the expression and the number of '+' characters in the expression, considering the last character in the expression.**

In this output state, the absolute difference is calculated based on the values of 'sub' and 'count', which are determined by the last character 'char' in the expression. If 'char' is '+', 'sub' is the number of '-' characters in the expression, and 'count' is the number of '+' characters in the expression. If 'char' is '-', 'sub' is the number of '-' characters in the expression plus 1, and 'count' is the number of '+' characters in the expression minus 1. The program returns the absolute difference between these two values.
