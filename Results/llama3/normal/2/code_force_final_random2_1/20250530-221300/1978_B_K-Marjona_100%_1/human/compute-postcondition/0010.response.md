Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, a is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, b is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 10^9, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input**

The code first reads a line from stdin and assigns the values to n, a, and b. Since stdin contains t lines of input, after reading one line, it now contains t-1 lines of input. The second line calculates the minimum value between n and b-a and assigns it to k. The value of k is now an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 10^9. The values of t, _, and the remaining input lines in stdin are not affected by the code.
