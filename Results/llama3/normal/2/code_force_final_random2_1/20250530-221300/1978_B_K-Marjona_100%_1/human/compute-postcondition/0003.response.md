The code prints the product of `a` and `n`, where `a` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9.

Output: **a*n (where a is an integer between 1 and 10^9 and n is an integer between 1 and 10^9)**
