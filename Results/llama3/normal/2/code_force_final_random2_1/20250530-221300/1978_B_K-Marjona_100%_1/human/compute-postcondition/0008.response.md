Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, a is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, b is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 10^9, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input. If b is less than or equal to a, the product of a and n is printed. Otherwise, b is larger than a, and the expression b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a is printed.**
