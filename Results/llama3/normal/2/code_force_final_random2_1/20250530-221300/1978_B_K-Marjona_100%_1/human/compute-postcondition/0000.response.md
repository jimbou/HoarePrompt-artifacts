The only objects in the loop head are variables  _ and input, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is at least 1 the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). Each of the following t lines contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9). So for the loop to be executed  the input must have at least 1 line and the _ is 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). Each of the following t lines contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), _ is 0**
