Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, a is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, b is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 10^9, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input.**

The first line reads the first line of input from stdin, which contains a single integer t. This line does not affect any variables. The second line reads the next line of input from stdin, which contains three integers n, a, and b. This line assigns the values of n, a, and b to the corresponding variables. The third line calculates the minimum value between n and b - a and assigns it to k. Since n and b - a are both integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, k is also an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 10^9. The value of _ remains unchanged at 0. Stdin now contains t - 1 lines of input.
