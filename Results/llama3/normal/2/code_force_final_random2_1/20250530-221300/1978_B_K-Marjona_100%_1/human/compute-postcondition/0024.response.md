Functionality: **This function reads a series of input lines from standard input, where the first line contains a positive integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and each subsequent line contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9). For each set of n, a, and b, it calculates and prints the minimum cost based on the condition that if b is less than or equal to a, it prints the product of a and n; otherwise, it prints the result of the expression b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a, where k is the minimum of n and b - a. After processing all input lines, the function concludes, leaving the standard input empty.**
