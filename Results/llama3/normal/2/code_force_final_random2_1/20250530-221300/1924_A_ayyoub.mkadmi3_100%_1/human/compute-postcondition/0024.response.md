Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing three values. The first value is a boolean indicating whether the length of string `s1` is greater than or equal to the product of `n` and `k`. The second value is a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end, where `r` is the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`. The third value is a string `s2` of length `m - k` consisting of the last `m - k` characters in the string `s` if `m > k`, otherwise an empty string.**
