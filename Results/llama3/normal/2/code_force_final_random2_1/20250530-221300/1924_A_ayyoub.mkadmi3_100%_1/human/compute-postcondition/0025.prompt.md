You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length m consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26.
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
        
    #State: `s` is a string of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the last character in the string `s`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `s1` is a string of length `m` consisting of all characters in the string `s`, `s2` is a string of length `m - k` consisting of the last `m - k` characters in the string `s` if `m > k`, otherwise `s2` is an empty string, `alphabet` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a tuple containing three values. The first value is a boolean indicating whether the length of string `s1` is greater than or equal to the product of `n` and `k`. The second value is a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end, where `r` is the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`. The third value is a string `s2` of length `m - k` consisting of the last `m - k` characters in the string `s` if `m > k`, otherwise an empty string.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a tuple containing three values. The first value is a boolean indicating whether the length of string `s1` is greater than or equal to the product of `n` and `k`. The second value is a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end, where `r` is the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`. The third value is a string `s2` of length `m - k` consisting of the last `m - k` characters in the string `s` if `m > k`, otherwise an empty string.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
