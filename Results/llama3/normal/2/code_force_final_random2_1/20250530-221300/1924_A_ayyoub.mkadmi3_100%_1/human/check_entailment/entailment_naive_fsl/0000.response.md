Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. 

For example, if the input is:

3
2 2 4
abba
2 2 3
abb
3 3 10
aabbccabab

The program will output:

YES
NO
aa
NO
ccc

However, the correct output should be:

YES
NO
aa
NO
ccc

The issue lies in the function `func_1`. The function is trying to find the first `n` characters in the string `s` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. However, it does not correctly handle the case when the string `s` contains less than `n` characters that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

For example, in the second test case, the string `s` is "abb" and `n` is 2. The function `func_1` will return `('No', 'b', '')`, which is incorrect because the string "aa" is not a subsequence of "abb".

To fix this issue, the function `func_1` needs to be modified to correctly handle the case when the string `s` contains less than `n` characters that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
