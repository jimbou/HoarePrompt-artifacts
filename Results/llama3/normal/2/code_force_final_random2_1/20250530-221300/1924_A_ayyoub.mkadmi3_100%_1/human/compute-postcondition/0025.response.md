Functionality: **This function processes a string `s` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and returns a tuple containing three values. The first value is a boolean indicating whether the length of the processed string is greater than or equal to the product of `n` and `k`. The second value is a substring of the processed string, starting from a calculated index based on the length of the string and `k`, to the end. The third value is a string consisting of the last `m - k` characters of the original string `s` if its length is greater than `k`, otherwise an empty string. The function effectively extracts and returns specific parts of the input string based on the given parameters `k` and `n`.**
