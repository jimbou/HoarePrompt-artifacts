    #State: `s` is a string of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the last character in the string `s`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `s1` is a string of length `m` consisting of all characters in the string `s`, `s2` is a string of length `m - k` consisting of the last `m - k` characters in the string `s` if `m > k`, otherwise `s2` is an empty string, `alphabet` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

    #The program returns a tuple containing three values. The first value is a boolean indicating whether the length of string `s1` is greater than or equal to the product of `n` and `k`. The second value is a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end, where `r` is the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`. The third value is a string `s2` of length `m - k` consisting of the last `m - k` characters in the string `s` if `m > k`, otherwise an empty string.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function processes a string `s` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and returns a tuple containing three values. The first value is a boolean indicating whether the length of the processed string is greater than or equal to the product of `n` and `k`. The second value is a substring of the processed string, starting from a calculated index based on the length of the string and `k`, to the end. The third value is a string consisting of the last `m - k` characters of the original string `s` if its length is greater than `k`, otherwise an empty string. The function effectively extracts and returns specific parts of the input string based on the given parameters `k` and `n`.
