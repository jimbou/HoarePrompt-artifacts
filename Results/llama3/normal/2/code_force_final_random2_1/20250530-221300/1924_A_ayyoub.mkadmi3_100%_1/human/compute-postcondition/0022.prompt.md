Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a string of length m consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, s1 is an empty string, s2 is an empty string, alphabet is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i in alphabet:
        if len(alphabet) != 1:
            alphabet.remove(i)
        else:
            s2 += i
            alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
        s1 += i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a string of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the first character in the string `s`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `s1` is a string of length 1 consisting of the first character in the string `s`, `s2` is an empty string if `alphabet` has more than one element, otherwise `s2` is a string of length 1 consisting of the first character in the string `s`, `alphabet` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets excluding the character `i` if `alphabet` has more than one element, otherwise `alphabet` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The current value of `i` is not a member of the set `alphabet` if `alphabet` has more than one element, otherwise the current value of `i` is a member of the set `alphabet`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a string of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character in the string `s`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `s1` is a string of length 2 consisting of the first two characters in the string `s`, `s2` is an empty string if `alphabet` has more than one element, otherwise `s2` is a string of length 1 consisting of the first character in the string `s`, `alphabet` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets excluding the character `i` if `alphabet` has more than one element, otherwise `alphabet` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If `alphabet` has more than one element and `i` is in `alphabet`, the size of `alphabet` is reduced by 1. If `alphabet` has only one element, `s2` is a string of length 1 consisting of the first character in the string `s` and the second character in the string `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a string of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the string `s`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26. If `i` is in `alphabet`, then `s1` is a string of length 3 consisting of the first three characters in the string `s`. If `alphabet` has more than one element, `s2` is an empty string and `alphabet` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets excluding the character `i`, with its size reduced by 1. If `alphabet` has only one element, `s2` is a string of length 2 consisting of the first two characters in the string `s` and `alphabet` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If `i` is not in `alphabet`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
