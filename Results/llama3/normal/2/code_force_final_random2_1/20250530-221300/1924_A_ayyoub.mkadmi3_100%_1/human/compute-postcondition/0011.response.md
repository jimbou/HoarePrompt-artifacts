Output State: **`s` is a string of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character in the string `s`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `s1` is a string of length 1 consisting of the first character in the string `s`, `s2` is an empty string if `alphabet` has more than one element, otherwise `s2` is a string of length 1 consisting of the first character in the string `s`, `alphabet` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets excluding the character `i` if `alphabet` has more than one element, otherwise `alphabet` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The current value of `i` is not a member of the set `alphabet` if `alphabet` has more than one element, otherwise the current value of `i` is a member of the set `alphabet` and the size of `alphabet` is reduced by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` and the values of `k`, `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged. The set `alphabet` has been updated by removing the character `i` from it, and the size of `alphabet` is reduced by 1. The current value of `i` is no longer a member of the set `alphabet` if `alphabet` has more than one element, otherwise the current value of `i` is still a member of the set `alphabet`.
