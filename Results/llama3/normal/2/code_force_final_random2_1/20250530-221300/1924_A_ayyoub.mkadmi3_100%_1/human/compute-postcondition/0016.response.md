The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and string `s`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If the string `s` has at least 3 characters the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character in the string `s`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string `s` must have at least 3 characters and `i` is the third character in the string `s`.
State: **`s` is a string of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the string `s`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `s1` is a string of length 2 consisting of the first two characters in the string `s`, `s2` is an empty string if `alphabet` has more than one element, otherwise `s2` is a string of length 1 consisting of the first character in the string `s`, `alphabet` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets excluding the character `i` if `alphabet` has more than one element, otherwise `alphabet` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If `alphabet` has more than one element and `i` is in `alphabet`, the size of `alphabet` is reduced by 1. If `alphabet` has only one element, `s2` is a string of length 1 consisting of the first character in the string `s` and the second character in the string `s`.**
