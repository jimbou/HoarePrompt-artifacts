Output State: **`s` is a string of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the string `s`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `s1` is a string of length 3 consisting of the first three characters in the string `s`. If `alphabet` has more than one element, `s2` is an empty string and `alphabet` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets excluding the character `i`, with its size reduced by 1 if `i` is in `alphabet`. If `alphabet` has only one element, `s2` is a string of length 2 consisting of the first two characters in the string `s` and `alphabet` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.**

In this output state, the value of `s1` has been updated to include the third character `i` of the string `s`, resulting in a string of length 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
