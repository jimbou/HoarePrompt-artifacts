Output State: **`s` is a string of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the first character in the string `s`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `s1` is an empty string, `s2` is an empty string, `alphabet` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets excluding the character `i`. The current value of `i` is not a member of the set `alphabet`. The current value of `alphabet` has at least one element.**

In this output state, the code has removed the character `i` from the set `alphabet`, so `alphabet` now contains all the first `k` lowercase English alphabets except `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
