Output State: **`s` is a string of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the last character in the string `s`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `s1` is a string of length `m` consisting of all characters in the string `s`, `s2` is a string of length `m - k` consisting of the last `m - k` characters in the string `s` if `m > k`, otherwise `s2` is an empty string, `alphabet` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `r` is the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`**.

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `r` which is the result of the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`. The value of `r` is equal to the integer division of `m` by `k`, since `s1` has the same length as `s`.
