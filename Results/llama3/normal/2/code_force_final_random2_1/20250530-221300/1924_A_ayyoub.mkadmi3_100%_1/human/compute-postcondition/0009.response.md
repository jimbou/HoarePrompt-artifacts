Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the first character in the string `s`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `s1` is a string of length 1 consisting of the first character in the string `s`, `s2` is an empty string if `alphabet` has more than one element, otherwise `s2` is a string of length 1 consisting of the first character in the string `s`, `alphabet` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets excluding the character `i` if `alphabet` has more than one element, otherwise `alphabet` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The current value of `i` is not a member of the set `alphabet` if `alphabet` has more than one element, otherwise the current value of `i` is a member of the set `alphabet`.***
