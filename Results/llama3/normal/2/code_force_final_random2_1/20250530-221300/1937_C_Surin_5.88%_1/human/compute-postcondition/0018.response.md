To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `i` is 2 and `n` is an integer greater than 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is 2, we need to increment it by 1 to make it 3. The value of `n` remains the same, but we need to ensure that it is still greater than the new value of `i`, which is 3.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `i` is 3
* `n` is an integer greater than 3

The other variables and objects in the state, such as `g`, `v1`, `I`, `R`, `kp`, `v2`, `r`, and the contents of `stdin`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is 2, `I` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, `kp` is 0, `i` is 3, `v2` is 2, `r` is '<', stdin contains at least 1 input less than before, and the string "? 0 0 1 1" and "? 1 1 2 2" are printed.**
