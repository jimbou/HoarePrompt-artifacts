Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `g` is 0, `v1` is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive, `I` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, `kp` is 0, `i` is n-1, `v2` is n-1, `prev` is 0, stdin contains at least 0 inputs, and the string "? 0 0 1 1", "? 1 1 2 2", ..., "? (n-2) (n-2) (n-1) (n-1)" are printed.**

In this output state, a new variable `prev` is introduced and assigned the value 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 0 inputs, and the same strings are printed as before.
