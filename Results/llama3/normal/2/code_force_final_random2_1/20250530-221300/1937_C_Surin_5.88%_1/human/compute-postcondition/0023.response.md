Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is 3, `I` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, `kp` is 0, `i` is 3, `v2` is 3, `r` is a string read from stdin, stdin contains at least 1 input less than before, and the string "? 0 0 1 1", "? 1 1 2 2", and "? 2 2 3 3" are printed.**

In this output state, the value of `v1` has been updated to 3, which is the value of `v2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 input less than before, and the three strings "? 0 0 1 1", "? 1 1 2 2", and "? 2 2 3 3" are still printed.
