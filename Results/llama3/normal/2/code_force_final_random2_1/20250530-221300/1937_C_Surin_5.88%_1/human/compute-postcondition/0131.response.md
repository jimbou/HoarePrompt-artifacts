Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 1, `kp` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `I` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is flushed and contains "? 0 0 1 1", and the output buffer is not empty. If `r` is '>', then `r` is a string containing the character '>', the output buffer contains "? [n-1] [n-1] [n-1] [n-1]", and `prev` is 1, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [1] [n-1] [1]". Otherwise, the output buffer contains "? [n-1] [1] [n-1] [0]" and `prev` is 0.**
