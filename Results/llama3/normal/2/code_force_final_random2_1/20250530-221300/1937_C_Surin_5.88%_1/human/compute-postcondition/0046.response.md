Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, g is 0, v1 is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive, I is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, kp is 0, i is n-1, v2 is n-1, prev is n-1 if r is '>', otherwise prev is 0, stdin contains at least 0 inputs, and the string "? 0 0 1 1", "? 1 1 2 2", ..., "? (n-2) (n-2) (n-1) (n-1)" are printed, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive, i is n-1, and prev is n-1 if r is '>', otherwise prev is 0, and r is a string read from stdin.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variables `i` and `prev` have reached their final values. The value of `i` is now `n-1`, and the value of `prev` is `n-1` if the last input `r` was '>', otherwise it is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The loop has printed all the required strings to the standard output, and the standard input has been read accordingly.
