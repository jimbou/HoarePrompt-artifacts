Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, g is 0, v1 is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive, I is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, kp is 0, i is 1, v2 is n-1, prev is 1, stdin contains at least 0 inputs, and the string "? 0 0 1 1", "? 1 1 2 2", ..., "? (n-2) (n-2) (n-1) (n-1)" are printed, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]", r is a string read from stdin and its current value is '>'**

In this output state, the value of `prev` has been updated to `i`, which is 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
