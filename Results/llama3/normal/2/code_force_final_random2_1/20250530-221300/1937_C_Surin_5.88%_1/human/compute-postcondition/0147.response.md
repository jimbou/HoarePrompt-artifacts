Output State: **`n` is an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `kp` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `I` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is empty, and prev is `n-1`, and this is printed: "! [n-1] [n-1] ? [n-1] [n-1] [n-1] [n-1]"**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, which means it forces the output buffer to be written to the console immediately. In this case, the output buffer contains the string "? [n-1] [n-1] [n-1] [n-1]" and "! [n-1] [n-1]" is already printed. After flushing the buffer, the output buffer becomes empty. The values of the other variables are not affected.
