Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is 3, `i` is 3, `kp` is 2, `v2` is 3, `I` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is flushed and contains "? 0 0 1 1", and the output buffer is not empty, and this is printed: "?  [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" where v1 is 3 and v2 is 3, r is an empty string, and the output buffer contains "? 3 3 3 3"**

In this output state, the value of `v1` has been updated to 3, which is the value of `v2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer now contains "? 3 3 3 3" because the value of `v1` has been updated to 3.
