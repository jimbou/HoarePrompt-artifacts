According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `kp` and the input from `stdin`. For the loop to execute, `stdin` must have at least 1 input. Before the loop starts, I is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin and R is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, but they are not used in the loop head. So, they do not need to be adjusted. 
State: **`I` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, `stdin` contains at least 1 input: an integer (the number of test cases), `kp` is 0**
