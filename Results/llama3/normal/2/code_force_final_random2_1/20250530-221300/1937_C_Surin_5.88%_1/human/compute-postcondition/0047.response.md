The code prints a formatted string indicating the values of `prev` and `v1`. 

`prev` is `n-1` if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is 0. Since the exact value of `r` is not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `prev`. However, based on the structure of the problem, `prev` will be either `n-1` or 0.

`v1` is an integer between 0 and `n-1` inclusive.

Output: **! [prev] [v1] (where prev is either n-1 or 0, and v1 is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive)**
