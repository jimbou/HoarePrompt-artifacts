Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, g is 0, v1 is 0, I is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, kp is 1, i is n-1, v2 is n-1, prev is n-1 if r is '>', otherwise prev is 0, stdin contains no input, and the string "? 0 0 1 1", "? 1 1 2 2", ..., "? (n-2) (n-2) (n-1) (n-1)" are printed, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is 0, i is n-1, and prev is n-1 if r is '>', otherwise prev is 0, and r is a string read from stdin, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is n-1 if r is '>', otherwise prev is 0, and v1 is 0, and the output buffer is flushed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    v2 = i
    print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    r = input('')
    if r == '<':
        v1 = v2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is at least 2, i is 1, g is 0, I is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, kp is 1, v2 is 1, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is flushed, and the output buffer contains the string "? 0 0 1 1", "? 1 1 2 2", ..., "? (n-2) (n-2) (n-1) (n-1)", "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is 0 or 1, i is n-1, and prev is n-1 if r is '>', otherwise prev is 0, and "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is n-1 if r is '>', otherwise prev is 0, and v1 is 0 or 1, and "? 0 0 1 1", and the current value of r is '<' if v1 is 1, otherwise r is '>'

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The program's state after executing the if-else block is as follows: `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `g` is 0, `I` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, `kp` is 1, `v2` is 2, `stdin` contains an empty string, the output buffer is flushed, and the output buffer contains a series of strings in the format "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" and "! [prev] [v1]" where `v1` is either 0, 1, or 2, and `prev` is either 0 or `n-1` depending on the value of `r`. If `r` is '<', then `v1` is 2, otherwise `v1` is either 0 or 1. The current value of `r` is either '<' or '>' depending on the value of `v1`. Additionally, the string "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" is printed where `v1` is either 0, 1, or 2, and `v2` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is at least 3, i is 3, g is 0, I is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, kp is 1, v2 is 3, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is flushed, and the output buffer contains a series of strings in the format "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" and "! [prev] [v1]" where v1 is either 0, 1, or 2, and prev is either 0 or n-1 depending on the value of r. If r is '<', then v1 is 2, otherwise v1 is either 0 or 1. The current value of r is either '<' or '>' depending on the value of v1. Additionally, the string "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" is printed where v1 is either 0, 1, or 2, and v2 is 3, and r is assigned the value of the input from stdin. If r is '<', then v1 is 3, otherwise v1 is either 0, 1, or 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
