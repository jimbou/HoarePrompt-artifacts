The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 3 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 3.
State: **n is an integer greater than 3, g is 0, v1 is 2 if the current value of r is '<', otherwise v1 is 1, i is 3, kp is 2, v2 is 2, I is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is flushed and contains "? 0 0 1 1", and the output buffer is not empty, and this is printed: "?  [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" where v1 is 2 if the current value of r is '<', otherwise v1 is 1 and v2 is 2, r is an empty string.**
