Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is 2, `I` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, `kp` is 0, `i` is 3, `v2` is 3, `r` is '<', stdin contains at least 1 input less than before, and the string "? 0 0 1 1" and "? 1 1 2 2" are printed.**

The value of `v2` is updated to be equal to the value of `i`, which is 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The state of the stdin and the printed strings also remain the same.
