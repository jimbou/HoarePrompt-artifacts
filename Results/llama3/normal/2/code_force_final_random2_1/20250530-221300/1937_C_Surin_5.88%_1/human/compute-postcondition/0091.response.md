Output: **n is greater than 3, i is 3, g is 0, I is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, kp is 1, v2 is n-1, stdin contains an empty string except for the first character which is either '<' or '>', the output buffer is flushed, and the output buffer contains a series of strings in the format "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" and "! [prev] [v1]" where v1 is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n-1, and prev is either 0 or n-1 depending on the value of r. Additionally, the string "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" is printed where v1 is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n-1, and v2 is n-1, and prev is 0, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n-1, i is 3, and prev is either 0 or n-1 depending on the value of r. If r is '>', then prev is 1, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n-1, i is 3, and prev is either 0 or n-1 depending on the value of r, and this is printed: '? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]' where v1 is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n-1, i is 3, and prev is either 0 or n-1 depending on the value of r.**
