Output State: **n is an integer, g is 0, v1 is 0, i is n-1, kp is 2, v2 is n-1, I is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed and is empty**

The code first assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, overwriting its previous value. Since `n` is now an integer, it is no longer greater than `n-1`. The second line sets `g` to 0, which was already 0, so no change occurs. The third line sets `v1` to 0, which was not previously defined, so it is now 0. The values of `i`, `kp`, `v2`, `I`, `R`, `stdin`, and the output buffer remain unchanged.
