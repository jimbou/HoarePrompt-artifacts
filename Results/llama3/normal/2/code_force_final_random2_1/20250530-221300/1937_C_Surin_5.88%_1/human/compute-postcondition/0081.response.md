Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `g` is 0, `I` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, `kp` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 1, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is flushed, and the output buffer contains a series of strings in the format "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" and "! [prev] [v1]" where `v1` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or `n-1`, and `prev` is either 0 or `n-1` depending on the value of `r`. Additionally, the string "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" is printed where `v1` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or `n-1`, and `v2` is `n-1`, and `prev` is 0, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where `v1` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or `n-1`, `i` is 1, and `prev` is either 0 or `n-1` depending on the value of `r`, and `r` is '>' depending on the value of `v1`. The current value of `r` is '>'.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `prev` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
