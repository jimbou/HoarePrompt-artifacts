The code defines two lambda functions, `I` and `R`, which are used to read input from stdin. The `I` function reads a line of input, splits it into integers separated by spaces, and returns them as a list. The `R` function reads a single integer from stdin and returns it.

After executing this code, the state of the program is as follows:

* The `I` function is defined and can be used to read a list of integers from stdin.
* The `R` function is defined and can be used to read a single integer from stdin.
* Stdin still contains one input: an integer (the number of test cases).

Note that the code does not modify the input in stdin, so the number of test cases is still available to be read.

Output State: **I is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, stdin contains 1 input: an integer (the number of test cases)**
