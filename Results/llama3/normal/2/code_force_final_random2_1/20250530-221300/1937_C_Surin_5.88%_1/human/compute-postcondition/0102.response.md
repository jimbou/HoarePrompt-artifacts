Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 1, `kp` is 2, `v2` is 1, `I` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed and is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `v2` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin and output buffer remain empty.
