Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required functionality of finding two indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized, where ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation. The program uses a binary search-like approach to find the maximum element in the permutation, and then finds the second maximum element by comparing each element with the maximum element. The program also correctly handles the interaction with the input by printing the queries in the required format and reading the responses.

Correctness: **True**
