The code prints a formatted string containing a question mark followed by the values of `v1` and `v2`. 

`v1` is 1 if the current value of `r` is '<', otherwise `v1` is 0. However, the value of `r` is not specified in the precondition, so we can't determine the exact value of `v1`. 

`v2` is 2.

Output: **? [v1] [v1] 2 2 (where v1 is 1 if the current value of r is '<', otherwise v1 is 0)**
