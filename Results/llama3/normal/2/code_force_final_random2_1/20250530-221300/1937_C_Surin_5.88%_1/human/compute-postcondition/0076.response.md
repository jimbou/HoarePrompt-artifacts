To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 1, and since `i` is the loop variable, it should start at 1 for the loop to begin its first iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `g` is 0, `I` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, `kp` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is flushed, and the output buffer contains a series of strings in the format "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" and "! [prev] [v1]" where `v1` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or `n-1`, and `prev` is either 0 or `n-1` depending on the value of `r`. If `r` is '<', then `v1` is `n-1`, otherwise `v1` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or `n-2`. The current value of `r` is either '<' or '>' depending on the value of `v1`. Additionally, the string "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" is printed where `v1` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or `n-1`, and `v2` is `n-1`, and `prev` is 0.**
