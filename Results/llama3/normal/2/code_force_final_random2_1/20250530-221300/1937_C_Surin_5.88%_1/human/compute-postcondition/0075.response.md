Output State: **n is at least n, i is n, g is 0, I is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, kp is 1, v2 is n-1, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is flushed, and the output buffer contains a series of strings in the format "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" and "! [prev] [v1]" where v1 is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n-1, and prev is either 0 or n-1 depending on the value of r. If r is '<', then v1 is n-1, otherwise v1 is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n-2. The current value of r is either '<' or '>' depending on the value of v1. Additionally, the string "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" is printed where v1 is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n-1, and v2 is n-1, and prev is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the variable "prev" has been assigned the value 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
