Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, g is 0, v1 is 1, I is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, kp is 0, i is 2, v2 is 2, stdin contains at least 1 input, and the string "? 0 0 1 1" is printed. If r is '<', then v1 is 1 and r is '<'.**

In this output state, the value of `v2` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions and functions defined in the initial state are still valid.
