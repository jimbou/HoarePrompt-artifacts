Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: I is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, stdin contains 1 input: an integer (the number of test cases)
Code of the loop:
for kp in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    g = 0
    v1 = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        v2 = i
        print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r = input('')
        if r == '<':
            v1 = v2
    prev = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r = input()
        if r == '>':
            prev = i
    print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
    sys.stdout.flush()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `g` is 0, `v1` is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive, `I` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, `kp` is 0, `i` is n-1, `v2` is n-1, `prev` is n-1 if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is 0, stdin contains at least 0 inputs, and the string "? 0 0 1 1", "? 1 1 2 2", ..., "? (n-2) (n-2) (n-1) (n-1)" are printed, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where `v1` is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive, `i` is n-1, and `prev` is n-1 if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is 0, and `r` is a string read from stdin, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is n-1 if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is 0, and `v1` is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive, and the output buffer is flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The output buffer is flushed and is empty, n is greater than n-1, i is n-1, g is 0, I is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, kp is 1, v2 is n-1, stdin contains an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `kp` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `I` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is empty, and prev is `n-1`, and this is printed: "! [n-1] [n-1] ? [n-1] [n-1] [n-1] [n-1]"




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
