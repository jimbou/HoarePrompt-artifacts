Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, g is 0, v1 is 1 if the current value of r is '<', otherwise v1 is 0, i is 2, kp is 2, v2 is 2, I is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is flushed and contains "? 0 0 1 1", and the output buffer is not empty, and this is printed: "?  [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" where v1 is 1 if the current value of r is '<', otherwise v1 is 0 and v2 is 2, r is an empty string.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line, `sys.stdout.flush()`, flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the output stream. This line does not modify any variables.

The second line, `r = input('')`, reads a single line of input from stdin and assigns it to the variable `r`. Since stdin contains an empty string, `r` becomes an empty string.

The initial state of the variables remains unchanged, except for `r`, which is now an empty string. The output buffer is still flushed and contains the same output as before. The functions `I` and `R` remain unchanged, and the values of `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, `kp`, and `v2` are not affected by the code.
