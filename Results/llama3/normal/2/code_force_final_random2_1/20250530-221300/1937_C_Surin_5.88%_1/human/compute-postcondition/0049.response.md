Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `g` is 0, `v1` is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive, `I` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, `kp` is 0, `i` is n-1, `v2` is n-1, `prev` is n-1 if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is 0, stdin contains at least 0 inputs, and the string "? 0 0 1 1", "? 1 1 2 2", ..., "? (n-2) (n-2) (n-1) (n-1)" are printed, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where `v1` is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive, `i` is n-1, and `prev` is n-1 if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is 0, and `r` is a string read from stdin, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is n-1 if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is 0, and `v1` is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive, and the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the output buffer is flushed. This means that any pending output is immediately written to the output stream, but the values of the variables and the state of the input buffer remain unchanged.
