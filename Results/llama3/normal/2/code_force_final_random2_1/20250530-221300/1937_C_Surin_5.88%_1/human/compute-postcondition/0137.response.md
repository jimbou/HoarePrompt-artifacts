Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 2, g is 0, v1 is n-1, i is 2, kp is 2, v2 is n-1, I is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, stdin contains a single character string: either '>' or another character, the output buffer is flushed and contains either "? [n-1] [n-1] [n-1] [n-1]" or "? [n-1] [1] [n-1] [0]" or "? [n-1] [2] [n-1] [prev]" or "? [n-1] [1] [n-1] [1]", and the output buffer is not empty, and prev is either 0 or 1, and r is a string containing a single character: either '>' or another character. If r is '>', then prev is 2. Otherwise, the state of prev is either 0 or 1.***
