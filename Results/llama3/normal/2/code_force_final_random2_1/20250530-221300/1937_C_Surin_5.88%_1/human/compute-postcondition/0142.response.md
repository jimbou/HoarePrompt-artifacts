Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 3, `kp` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `I` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, stdin is empty, the output buffer is empty, `r` is a string containing a single character: either '>' or another character, and `prev` is 3. If `r` is '>', then the state of `prev` was 2 before being updated to 3. Otherwise, the state of `prev` was either 0 or 1 before being updated to 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `prev` has been updated to 3, which was previously either 0, 1, or 2 (if `r` is '>'). All other variables remain unchanged.
