Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `g` is 0, `I` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, `kp` is 1, `v2` is 3, `stdin` contains an empty string, the output buffer is flushed, and the output buffer contains a series of strings in the format "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" and "! [prev] [v1]" where `v1` is either 0, 1, or 2, and `prev` is either 0 or `n-1` depending on the value of `r`. If `r` is '<', then `v1` is 2, otherwise `v1` is either 0 or 1. The current value of `r` is either '<' or '>' depending on the value of `v1`. Additionally, the string "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" is printed where `v1` is either 0, 1, or 2, and `v2` is 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `v2` has been updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
