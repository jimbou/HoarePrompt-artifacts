The code prints a formatted string containing the characters '?' and the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1`, and `prev`. 
`v1` is `n-1` and `n` is an integer greater than 1, so `v1` is an integer greater than 0. 
`i` is 1, and `prev` is 0.
Output: **? [n-1] 1 [n-1] 0 (where n-1 is an integer greater than 0)**
