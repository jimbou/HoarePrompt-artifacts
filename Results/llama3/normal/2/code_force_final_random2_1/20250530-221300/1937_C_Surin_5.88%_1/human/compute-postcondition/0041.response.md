The code prints a formatted string containing the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1`, and `prev`. 

`v1` is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive. 
`i` is 3. 
`prev` is 2 if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is 0.

Output: **? [v1] 3 [v1] [prev] (where v1 is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive, and prev is 2 if r is '>', otherwise prev is 0)**
