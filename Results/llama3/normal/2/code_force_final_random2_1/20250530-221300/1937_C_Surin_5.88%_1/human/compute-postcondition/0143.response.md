Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 3, g is 0, v1 is n-1, i is 3, kp is 2, v2 is n-1, I is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, stdin is empty, the output buffer is empty, r is a string containing a single character: either '>' or another character, and prev is 3. If r is '>', then the state of prev was 2 before being updated to 3. Otherwise, the state of prev was either 0 or 1 before being updated to 3.***
