Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, g is 0, v1 is 0, i is 1, kp is 2, v2 is 1, I is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is flushed and contains "? 0 0 1 1", and the output buffer is not empty.**

Explanation:
The first line, `sys.stdout.flush()`, flushes the output buffer, which means that any buffered output is immediately written to the output stream. In this case, the output buffer contains the string "? 0 0 1 1", so this string is printed to the output stream. The output buffer is now empty.

The second line, `r = input('')`, reads a line of input from stdin and assigns it to the variable `r`. Since stdin is empty, the input function will block until a line of input is available. Once a line of input is available, it is assigned to `r`. The state of stdin is not changed, as the input function does not modify stdin.

The values of the variables `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, `kp`, `v2`, `I`, and `R` are not modified by the code, so their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Note that the output buffer is not empty after the code executes, as it contains the string "? 0 0 1 1" that was printed by the first line.
