Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `I` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, `kp` is 0, `i` is 1, `v2` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 input**

In this output state, the value of `v2` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 input.
