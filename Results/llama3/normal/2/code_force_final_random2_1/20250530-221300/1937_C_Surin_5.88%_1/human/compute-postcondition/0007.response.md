Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, g is 0, v1 is 0, I is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, kp is 0, i is 1, v2 is 1, stdin contains at least 1 input, and the string "? 0 0 1 1" is printed, r is an empty string**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line, `sys.stdout.flush()`, forces the output buffer to be flushed, ensuring that any pending output is immediately printed. In this case, the string "? 0 0 1 1" is printed as a result of this operation. The second line, `r = input('')`, reads an empty string from stdin and assigns it to the variable `r`. Since stdin contains at least one input, this operation does not affect the state of stdin. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
