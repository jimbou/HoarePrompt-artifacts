Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required functionality of finding two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, where p_i and p_j are elements of a secret permutation.

The program first finds the maximum element in the permutation by comparing each element with the current maximum. It then finds the second maximum element by comparing each element with the current maximum and the previous maximum.

The program uses a specific query format to compare elements, which is allowed by the problem statement. It also ensures that the number of queries does not exceed 3n, which is the limit specified in the problem.

The program correctly handles the case where n is 2, in which case it simply prints the indices of the two elements.

The program also correctly handles the case where the maximum element is not unique, in which case it prints the indices of any two elements that have the maximum value.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
