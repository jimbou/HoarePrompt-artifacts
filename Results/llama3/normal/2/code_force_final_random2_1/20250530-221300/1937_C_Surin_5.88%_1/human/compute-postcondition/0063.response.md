The code prints a formatted string indicating the values of `v1` and `v2`. Where `v1` is 0 or 1, and `v2` is 2.
Output: ** `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `g` is 0, `I` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, `kp` is 1, `v2` is 2, `stdin` contains an empty string, the output buffer is flushed, and the output buffer contains the string "? 0 0 1 1", "? 1 1 2 2", ..., "? (n-2) (n-2) (n-1) (n-1)", "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where `v1` is 0 or 1, `i` is `n-1`, and `prev` is `n-1` if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is 0, and "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is `n-1` if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is 0, and `v1` is 0 or 1, and "? 0 0 1 1", and the current value of `r` is '<' if `v1` is 1, otherwise `r` is '>', and this is printed: "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" where `v1` is 0 or 1, and `v2` is 2**
