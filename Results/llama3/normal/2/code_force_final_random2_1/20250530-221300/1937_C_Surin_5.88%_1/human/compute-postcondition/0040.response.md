The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive, `I` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, `kp` is 0, `i` is 3, `v2` is n-1, `prev` is 2 if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is 0, stdin contains at least 0 inputs, and the string "? 0 0 1 1", "? 1 1 2 2", ..., "? (n-2) (n-2) (n-1) (n-1)" are printed, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive, i is 3, and prev is 2 if `r` is '>', otherwise prev is 0.**
