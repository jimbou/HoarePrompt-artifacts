The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 2, `kp` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `I` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is flushed and contains "? 0 0 1 1", and the output buffer is not empty. If `r` is '>', then `r` is a string containing the character '>', the output buffer contains "? [n-1] [n-1] [n-1] [n-1]", and `prev` is 1, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [1] [n-1] [1]". Otherwise, the output buffer contains "? [n-1] [1] [n-1] [0]" and `prev` is 0.**
