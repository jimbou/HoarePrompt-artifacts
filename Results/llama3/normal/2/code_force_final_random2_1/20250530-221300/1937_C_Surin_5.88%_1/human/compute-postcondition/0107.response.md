Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `i` is 1, `kp` is 2, `v2` is 1, `I` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is flushed and contains "? 0 0 1 1", and the output buffer is not empty, and the current value of `r` is '<'.**

In this output state, the value of `v1` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `v2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer still contains the string "? 0 0 1 1" and is not empty. The stdin is still empty, and the functions `I` and `R` remain unchanged. The current value of `r` is still '<'.
