Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, g is 0, v1 is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive, I is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, kp is 0, i is n-1, v2 is n-1, stdin contains at least 0 inputs, and the string "? 0 0 1 1", "? 1 1 2 2", ..., "? (n-2) (n-2) (n-1) (n-1)" are printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the loop has iterated `n-1` times, and the value of `v1` is the last value of `v2` that was less than the input `r`. The loop has printed a series of strings to the console, each in the format "? x x y y" where `x` is the previous value of `v1` and `y` is the current value of `v2`. The input `r` is a string read from stdin, and the value of `i` is `n-1`. The other variables `g`, `I`, `R`, and `kp` remain unchanged.
