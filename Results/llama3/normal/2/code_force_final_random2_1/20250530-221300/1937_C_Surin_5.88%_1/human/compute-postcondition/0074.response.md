Output State: **n is at least n, i is n, g is 0, I is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, kp is 1, v2 is n-1, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is flushed, and the output buffer contains a series of strings in the format "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" and "! [prev] [v1]" where v1 is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n-1, and prev is either 0 or n-1 depending on the value of r. If r is '<', then v1 is n-1, otherwise v1 is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n-2. The current value of r is either '<' or '>' depending on the value of v1. Additionally, the string "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" is printed where v1 is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n-1, and v2 is n-1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: The loop has finished executing, and the value of `i` is now equal to `n`. The value of `v2` is `n-1`. The output buffer contains a series of strings in the format "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" and "! [prev] [v1]" where `v1` can take any value from 0 to `n-1`, and `prev` is either 0 or `n-1` depending on the value of `r`. If `r` is '<', then `v1` is `n-1`, otherwise `v1` can take any value from 0 to `n-2`. The current value of `r` is either '<' or '>' depending on the value of `v1`. Additionally, the string "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" is printed where `v1` can take any value from 0 to `n-1`, and `v2` is `n-1`.
