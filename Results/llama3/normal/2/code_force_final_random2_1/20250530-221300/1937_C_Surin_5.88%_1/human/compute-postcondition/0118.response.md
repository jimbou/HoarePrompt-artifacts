To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet.

The initial state provides the following information:

*   `n` is an integer greater than 3.
*   `g` is 0.
*   `v1` is 2 if the current value of `r` is '<', otherwise `v1` is 1.
*   `i` is 3.
*   `kp` is 2.
*   `v2` is 3.
*   `I` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin.
*   `R` is a function that reads a single integer from stdin.
*   stdin contains an empty string.
*   The output buffer is flushed and contains "? 0 0 1 1".
*   The output buffer is not empty.
*   `r` is an empty string.

Given the initial state, let's evaluate the print statement:

```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Based on the initial state, we know that `r` is an empty string. Therefore, `v1` will be 1 (since `r` is not '<').

The value of `v2` is given as 3.

So, when the print statement is executed, it will print:

Output: **? 1 1 3 3**
