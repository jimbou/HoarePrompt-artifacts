Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, g is 0, v1 is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive, I is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, kp is 0, i is 3, v2 is n-1, prev is 3, stdin contains at least 0 inputs, and the string "? 0 0 1 1", "? 1 1 2 2", ..., "? (n-2) (n-2) (n-1) (n-1)" are printed, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive, i is 3, and prev is 3, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive, i is 3, and prev is 3, and r is a string read from stdin.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `prev` has been updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
