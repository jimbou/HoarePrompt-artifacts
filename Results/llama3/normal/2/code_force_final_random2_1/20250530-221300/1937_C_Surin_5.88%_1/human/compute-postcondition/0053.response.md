Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `I` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, `kp` is 1, `v2` is 1, `prev` is n-1 if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is 0, stdin contains no input, and the string "? 0 0 1 1", "? 1 1 2 2", ..., "? (n-2) (n-2) (n-1) (n-1)" are printed, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where `v1` is 0, `i` is n-1, and `prev` is n-1 if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is 0, and `r` is a string read from stdin, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is n-1 if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is 0, and `v1` is 0, and the output buffer is flushed**

In this output state, the value of `v2` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
