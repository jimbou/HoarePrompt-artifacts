To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` has increased, `n` must still be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables in the state (`g`, `v1`, `kp`, `v2`, `I`, `R`, `stdin`, `output buffer`, and `r`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is n-1, `i` is 3, `kp` is 2, `v2` is n-1, `I` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, `stdin` contains a single character string: either '>' or another character, the output buffer is flushed and contains either "? [n-1] [n-1] [n-1] [n-1]" or "? [n-1] [1] [n-1] [0]" or "? [n-1] [2] [n-1] [prev]" or "? [n-1] [1] [n-1] [1]", and the output buffer is not empty, and `prev` is either 0 or 1, and `r` is a string containing a single character: either '>' or another character. If `r` is '>', then `prev` is 2. Otherwise, the state of `prev` is either 0 or 1.**
