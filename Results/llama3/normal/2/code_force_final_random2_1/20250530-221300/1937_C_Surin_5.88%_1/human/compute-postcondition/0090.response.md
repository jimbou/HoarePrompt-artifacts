The code prints a formatted string in the format "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n-1, i is 3, and prev is either 0 or n-1 depending on the value of r.

Output: **? [v1] 3 [v1] [prev] (where v1 is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n-1, and prev is either 0 or n-1 depending on the value of r)**
