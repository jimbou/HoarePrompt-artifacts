Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `I` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, `kp` is 0, `i` is 1, `v2` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 input, and the string "? 0 0 1 1" is printed, `r` is a string that is equal to '<'**

In this output state, the value of `v1` has been updated to 1, which is the same as the value of `v2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The string "? 0 0 1 1" is still printed, and the stdin still contains at least 1 input.
