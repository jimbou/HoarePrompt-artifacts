Based on the precondition, the `print` statement will print a formatted string containing the values of `prev` and `v1`.

The value of `prev` is `n-1`, which is the value of `n` minus 1.

The value of `v1` is also `n-1`, which is the same as the value of `prev`.

Therefore, the output will be a string containing the exclamation mark `!`, followed by the value of `prev` (which is `n-1`), a space, and then the value of `v1` (which is also `n-1`).

Output: **! [n-1] [n-1]**
