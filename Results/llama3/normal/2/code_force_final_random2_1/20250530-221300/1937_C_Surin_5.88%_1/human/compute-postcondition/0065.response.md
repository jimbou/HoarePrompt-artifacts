Output State: **n is at least 3, i is 2, g is 0, I is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, kp is 1, v2 is 2, v1 is 2, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is flushed, the output buffer contains the string "? 0 0 1 1", "? 1 1 2 2", ..., "? (n-2) (n-2) (n-1) (n-1)", "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is 2, i is n-1, and prev is n-1 if r is '>', otherwise prev is 0, and "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is n-1 if r is '>', otherwise prev is 0, and v1 is 2, and "? 0 0 1 1", and the current value of r is '<' if v1 is 1, otherwise r is '>', and this is printed: "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" where v1 is 2, and v2 is 2, and r is an empty string.**

In this output state, the value of v1 has been updated to 2, which is the value of v2. The rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
