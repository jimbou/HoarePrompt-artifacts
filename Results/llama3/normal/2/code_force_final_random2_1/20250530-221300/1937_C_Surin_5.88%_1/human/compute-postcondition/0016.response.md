Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is 2, `I` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, `kp` is 0, `i` is 2, `v2` is 2, `r` is '<', stdin contains at least 1 input less than before, and the string "? 0 0 1 1" and "? 1 1 2 2" are printed.**

In this output state, the value of `v1` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `v2`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `n`, `g`, `kp`, `i`, `v2`, `r`, and stdin are still valid. The strings "? 0 0 1 1" and "? 1 1 2 2" are still printed.
