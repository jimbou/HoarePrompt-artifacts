Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 2, `kp` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `I` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, `r` is a string containing a single character: either '>' or another character, `prev` is 2, stdin contains a single character string: either '>' or another character, the output buffer is flushed and contains either "? [n-1] [n-1] [n-1] [n-1]" or "? [n-1] [1] [n-1] [0]" or "? [n-1] [2] [n-1] [prev]" or "? [n-1] [1] [n-1] [1]", and the output buffer is not empty.**

In this output state, the value of `prev` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer still contains one of the specified strings, and the stdin still contains a single character string.
