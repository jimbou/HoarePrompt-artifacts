The code prints a formatted string containing the character '?', the value of `v1` which is `n-1`, the value of `i` which is 2, the value of `v1` again which is `n-1`, and the value of `prev` which depends on the value of `r`. If `r` is '>', then `prev` is 1, otherwise `prev` is 0.
Output: **? [n-1] [2] [n-1] [1] (if r is '>') or ? [n-1] [2] [n-1] [0] (otherwise)**
