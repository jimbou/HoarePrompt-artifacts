Based on the precondition, the print statement will print a string in the format "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]".

Here's a breakdown of the values:

* `v1` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or `n-1`, depending on the value of `r`. Since `r` is either '<' or '>' depending on the value of `v1`, we can't determine the exact value of `v1` without knowing the value of `r`. However, we know that `v1` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, inclusive.
* `i` is 1, as specified in the precondition.
* `prev` is either 0 or `n-1`, depending on the value of `r`. If `r` is '<', then `prev` is `n-1`, otherwise `prev` is 0.

Therefore, the output will be a string in the format "? [v1] 1 [v1] [prev]", where `v1` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, inclusive, and `prev` is either 0 or `n-1`.

Output: **? [v1] 1 [v1] [prev] (where v1 is an integer between 0 and n-1, inclusive, and prev is either 0 or n-1)**
