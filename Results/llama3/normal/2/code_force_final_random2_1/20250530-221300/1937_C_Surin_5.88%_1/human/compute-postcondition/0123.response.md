Output State: **n is an integer, g is 0, v1 is n-1, i is n, kp is 2, v2 is n-1, I is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is flushed and contains "? 0 0 1 1", and the output buffer is not empty, and this is printed: "?  [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" where v1 is n-1 and v2 is n-1, r is an empty string, and the output buffer contains "? [n-1] [n-1] [n-1] [n-1]"**.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `v1` has been updated to `n-1`, which is the last value of `v2` in the loop. The variable `i` has reached the value of `n`, which is the upper limit of the loop. The output buffer contains the last printed string, which is "? [n-1] [n-1] [n-1] [n-1]". The other variables remain unchanged.
