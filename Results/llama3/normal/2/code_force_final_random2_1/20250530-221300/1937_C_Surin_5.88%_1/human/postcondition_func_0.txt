This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. For each test case, it finds the maximum and second maximum elements in the permutation by querying the input in a specific format and prints the indices of these elements in the format "! prev v1". The function iterates over all test cases and performs the same operations for each case.
