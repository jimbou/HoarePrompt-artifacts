Postcondition: ***n is at least 2, i is 1, g is 0, I is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, kp is 1, v2 is 1, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is flushed, and the output buffer contains the string "? 0 0 1 1", "? 1 1 2 2", ..., "? (n-2) (n-2) (n-1) (n-1)", "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is 0 or 1, i is n-1, and prev is n-1 if r is '>', otherwise prev is 0, and "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is n-1 if r is '>', otherwise prev is 0, and v1 is 0 or 1, and "? 0 0 1 1", and the current value of r is '<' if v1 is 1, otherwise r is '>'***
