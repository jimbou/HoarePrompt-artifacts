Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `I` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, `kp` is 1, `v2` is 1, `prev` is 0, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is flushed, and the output buffer contains the string "? 0 0 1 1", "? 1 1 2 2", ..., "? (n-2) (n-2) (n-1) (n-1)", "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is 1, i is n-1, and prev is 0, and "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is 0, and v1 is 1, and "? 0 0 1 1", and the current value of r is '<'**

The value of `v1` is updated to be equal to `v2`, which is 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The output buffer still contains the same strings, but now the string "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" has `v1` equal to 1, and the string "! [prev] [v1]" also has `v1` equal to 1.
