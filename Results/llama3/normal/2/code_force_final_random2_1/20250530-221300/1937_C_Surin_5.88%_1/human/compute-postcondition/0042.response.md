Output: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive, `I` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, `kp` is 0, `i` is 3, `v2` is n-1, `prev` is 2 if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is 0, stdin contains at least 0 inputs, and the string "? 0 0 1 1", "? 1 1 2 2", ..., "?

[v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive, i is 3, and prev is 2 if `r` is '>', otherwise prev is 0, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive, i is 3, and prev is 2 if `r` is '>', otherwise prev is 0**
