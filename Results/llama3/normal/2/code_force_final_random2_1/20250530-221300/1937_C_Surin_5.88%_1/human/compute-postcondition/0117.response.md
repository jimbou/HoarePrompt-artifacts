Output State: **n is an integer greater than 3, g is 0, v1 is 2 if the current value of r is '<', otherwise v1 is 1, i is 3, kp is 2, v2 is 3, I is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, stdin contains an empty string, the output buffer is flushed and contains "? 0 0 1 1", and the output buffer is not empty, and this is printed: "?  [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" where v1 is 2 if the current value of r is '<', otherwise v1 is 1 and v2 is 3, r is an empty string.**

In this output state, the value of v2 has been updated to 3, which is the current value of i. The other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer still contains the same string, and the output buffer is still not empty. The value of v1 is still dependent on the value of r, which is an empty string.
