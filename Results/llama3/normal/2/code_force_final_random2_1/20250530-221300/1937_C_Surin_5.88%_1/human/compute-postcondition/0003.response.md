To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` will start at 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `I` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, `kp` is 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 input**
