Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, g is 0, v1 is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive, I is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that reads a single integer from stdin, kp is 0, i is 1, v2 is n-1, prev is 0, stdin contains at least 0 inputs, and the string "? 0 0 1 1", "? 1 1 2 2", ..., "? (n-2) (n-2) (n-1) (n-1)" are printed, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]", r is a string read from stdin**.

The code snippet provided does not modify any of the variables in the initial state. The first line, `sys.stdout.flush()`, is used to force the output buffer to be written to the console, but it does not affect any variables. The second line, `r = input()`, reads a string from stdin and assigns it to the variable `r`, which is a new variable introduced by the code. The initial state remains unchanged, except for the addition of the new variable `r` with a value read from stdin.
