Functionality: This function takes as input a list of integers and a string of characters, where each character is either 'L' or 'R', and returns a list of values. The function first rearranges the input list based on the characters in the string, where 'L' indicates taking the next element from the left and 'R' indicates taking the next element from the right. Then, it calculates the product of each element in the rearranged list with a running product, starting from the last element and moving backwards. The function returns the list of these products in reverse order.
