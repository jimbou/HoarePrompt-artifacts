Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^4 for all i, s is a string of n characters such that each character is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list of n integers, l is n, and r is -1.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same values for n, m, and a as in the initial state. The string s will also remain the same. However, the list b will now contain all the integers from the list a, in the order determined by the string s. If s[i] is 'L', the integer a[i] will be appended to b, and if s[i] is 'R', the integer a[n-1-i] will be appended to b. The variables l and r will be updated accordingly, with l becoming n and r becoming -1.
