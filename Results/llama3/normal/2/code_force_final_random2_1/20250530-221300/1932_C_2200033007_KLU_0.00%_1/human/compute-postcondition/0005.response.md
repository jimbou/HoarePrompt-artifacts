Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^4 for all i, s is a string of n characters such that each character is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list containing one integer which is a[n - 1], l is 0, r is n - 2, and i is 0.**

In this output state, the code has appended the integer at index `r` of list `a` to list `b`, and then decremented `r` by 1. The value of `r` is now `n - 2`, and list `b` contains the integer that was previously at index `n - 1` of list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
