Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^4 for all i, s is a string of n characters such that each character is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list containing either the integer a[l] or a[n - 1], l is either 1 or 0, r is either n - 1 or n - 2, and i is 1.**

The code appends the integer at index `r` of list `a` to list `b`. Since `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, the appended integer is either `a[n - 1]` or `a[n - 2]`. Then, `r` is decremented by 1, making it either `n - 2` or `n - 3`. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged.
