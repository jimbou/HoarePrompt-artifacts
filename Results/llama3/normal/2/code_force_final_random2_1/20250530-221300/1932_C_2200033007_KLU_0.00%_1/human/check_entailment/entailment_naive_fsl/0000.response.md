Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m after each command. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the product of the elements. It multiplies all the elements together and then takes the remainder when divided by m, which is not the same as taking the remainder of the product of the elements at each step.

For example, consider the input:

3 6
3 1 4
LRL

The correct output should be:

0 2 4

However, the program will output:

0 2 8

This is because the program calculates the product of all elements (3*1*4 = 12) and then takes the remainder when divided by 6 (12 % 6 = 0), instead of taking the remainder of the product of the elements at each step (3 % 6 = 3, 3*1 % 6 = 3, 3*1*4 % 6 = 12 % 6 = 0).

To fix this issue, the program should calculate the product of the elements at each step and take the remainder when divided by m, instead of multiplying all the elements together and then taking the remainder.
