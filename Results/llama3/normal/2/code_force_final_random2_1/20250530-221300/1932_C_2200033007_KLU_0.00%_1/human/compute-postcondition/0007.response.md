State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^4 for all `i`, `s` is a string of `n` characters such that each character is either 'L' or 'R'. If `s[i]` is 'L', then `b` is a list containing the integer `a[l]`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, and `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is 'R', then `b` is a list containing one integer which is `a[n - 1]`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 2`, and `i` is 1.**
