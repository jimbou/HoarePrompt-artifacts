Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^4 for all i, s is a string of n characters such that each character is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list containing the integer a[l-1] if s[i] is 'L' or a[n-1] if s[i] is 'R', l is 2 if s[i] is 'L' or 0 if s[i] is 'R', r is n - 1 if s[i] is 'L' or n - 2 if s[i] is 'R', and i is 1.**

In this final state, the value of `n` and `m` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The list `a` also remains the same as it is not altered by the code. The string `s` remains unchanged as well. The list `b` now contains one additional integer, which is `a[l-1]` if `s[i]` is 'L' or `a[n-1]` if `s[i]` is 'R'. The value of `l` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 2 if `s[i]` is 'L' or remains 0 if `s[i]` is 'R'. The value of `r` is not modified by the code, so it remains `n - 1` if `s[i]` is 'L' or `n - 2` if `s[i]` is 'R'. The value of `i` remains 1 as it is not modified by the code.
