Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^4 for all `i`, `s` is a string of `n` characters such that each character is either 'L' or 'R', `b` is an empty list, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'R'.***
