Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^4 for all i, s is a string of n characters such that each character is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list containing the integer a[l-1] if s[i] is 'L' or a[n-1] if s[i] is 'R', l is 3 if s[i] is 'L' or 1 if s[i] is 'R', r is n - 1 if s[i] is 'L' or n - 2 if s[i] is 'R', and i is 2.**

In this output state, the values of n, m, and a remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The string s also remains the same. The list b now contains an additional element, which is the integer at index l-1 of list a if s[i] is 'L', or the integer at index n-1 of list a if s[i] is 'R'. The value of l is incremented by 1, so it becomes 3 if s[i] is 'L' or 1 if s[i] is 'R'. The value of r remains the same, which is n - 1 if s[i] is 'L' or n - 2 if s[i] is 'R'. The value of i remains unchanged at 2.
