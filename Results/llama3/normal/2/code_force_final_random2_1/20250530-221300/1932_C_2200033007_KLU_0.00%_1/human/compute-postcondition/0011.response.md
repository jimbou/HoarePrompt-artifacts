The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^4 for all i, s is a string of n characters such that each character is either 'L' or 'R'. If s[i] is 'L', then b is a list containing the integer a[l-1], l is 2, r is n - 1, and i is 2. If s[i] is 'R', then b is a list containing the integer a[n-1], l is 0, r is n - 2, and i is 2.**
