Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^4 for all i, s is a string of n characters such that each character is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list containing the integer a[r] and the integer a[r-1], l is 2, r is n - 2, and i is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `n` and `m` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The list `a` also remains the same as it is not modified. The string `s` remains unchanged as well. The list `b` now contains two integers: the original integer `a[r]` and the new integer `a[r-1]` that was appended to it. The value of `l` remains 2, and the value of `r` is decremented by 1, making it `n - 2`. The value of `i` remains 2.
