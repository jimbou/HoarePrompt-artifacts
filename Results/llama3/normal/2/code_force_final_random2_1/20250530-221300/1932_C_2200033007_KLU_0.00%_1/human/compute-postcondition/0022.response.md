Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 0, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^4 for all i, s is a string of n characters such that each character is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list of at least 2 integers, l is n, r is -1, ans is a list containing the value of p*v, p*v*v, and p*v*v*v, p is p*v*v*v, and v is the element before the second element of the list b.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `b`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `p` is updated to `p*v*v*v` and the list `ans` now contains three elements: `p*v`, `p*v*v`, and `p*v*v*v`. The value of `v` remains the same, which is the element before the second element of the list `b`.
