Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 0, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^4 for all i, s is a string of n characters such that each character is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list of at least 2 integers, l is n, r is -1, ans is a list containing the value of p*v and p*v*v, p is p*v*v, and v is the second element of the list b.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `p` and `ans`. The first line multiplies the value of `p` by `v`, effectively squaring the original value of `p*v` since `p` was initially `p*v`. The second line appends this new value of `p` to the list `ans`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
