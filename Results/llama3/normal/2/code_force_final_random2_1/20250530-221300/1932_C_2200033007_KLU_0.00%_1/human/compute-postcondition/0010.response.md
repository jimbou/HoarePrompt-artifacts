Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^4 for all i, s is a string of n characters such that each character is either 'L' or 'R'. If s[i] is 'L', then b is a list containing the integer a[l-1], l is 2, r is n - 1, and i is 1. If s[i] is 'R', then b is a list containing the integer a[n-1], l is 0, r is n - 2, and i is 1.***
