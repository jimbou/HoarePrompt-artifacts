Postcondition: ***n is an integer equal to a, m is an integer equal to b, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in l, c is equal to the sum of all elements in l, _ is 0, x is the last element in the list l, a is the first input, b is the second input, m is greater than 0. If a - 2 >= 0, then s is the cumulative sum of the first b - (a - 1) elements in l and a is greater than or equal to 2. Additionally, either b - a + 1 is less than or equal to 1 or s is less than 2 * (b - a + 1).***
