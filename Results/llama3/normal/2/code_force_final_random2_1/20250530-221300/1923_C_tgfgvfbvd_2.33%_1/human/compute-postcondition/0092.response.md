Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `x` is the last element in the list `l`, `a` is the second input, `b` is the third input, `s` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` from index `b - 1` minus the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to index `a - 2`.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by subtracting the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to index `a - 2` from its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
