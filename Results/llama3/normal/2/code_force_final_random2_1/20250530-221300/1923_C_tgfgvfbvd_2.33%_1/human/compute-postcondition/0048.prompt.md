Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, l is a list of integers, p is an empty list, c is 0, _ is 1, x is the last element in the list l, a is the first input, b is the second input, s is not defined.
Code of the loop:
for x in l:
    c += x
    p.append(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, l is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, p is a list containing the value of the first element in l, c is equal to the first element in l, _ is 1, x is the first element in the list l, a is the first input, b is the second input, s is not defined

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, l is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, p is a list containing the value of the first element in l and the sum of the first and second elements in l, c is equal to the sum of the first and second elements in l, _ is 1, x is the second element in the list l, a is the first input, b is the second input, s is not defined

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, l is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, p is a list containing the value of the first element in l, the sum of the first and second elements in l, and the sum of the first and second elements in l plus the third element in l, c is equal to the sum of the first and second elements in l plus the third element in l, _ is 1, x is the third element in the list l, a is the first input, b is the second input, s is not defined




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
