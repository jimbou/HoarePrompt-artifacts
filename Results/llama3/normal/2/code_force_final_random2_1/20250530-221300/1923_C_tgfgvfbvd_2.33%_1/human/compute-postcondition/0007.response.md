The first line increments `c` by the value of `x`. Since `c` is the sum of the first two elements in `l` and `x` is the third element in `l`, `c` becomes the sum of the first three elements in `l`. The second line appends the new value of `c` to the list `p`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, p is a list containing three elements: the first element in l, the sum of the first two elements in l, and the sum of the first three elements in l, c is the sum of the first three elements in l, _ is 0, x is the third element in l, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**
