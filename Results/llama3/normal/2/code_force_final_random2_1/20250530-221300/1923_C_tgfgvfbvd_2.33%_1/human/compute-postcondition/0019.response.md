Output: **n is a positive integer, m is an integer greater than 0, l is an empty list, p is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in the original list l, c is the sum of all elements in the original list l, _ is 0, x is the last element in the original list l, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the cumulative sum of the first b-1 elements in the original list l, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If a - 2 >= 0, then s is the cumulative sum of the first b-1 elements in the original list l minus the cumulative sum of the first a-2 elements in the original list l. Otherwise, no change is made to s. Additionally, either b - a + 1 is less than or equal to 1, or s is less than 2 * (b - a + 1), and 'NO' is printed**
