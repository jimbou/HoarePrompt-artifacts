To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `l`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, and `x` is the second element in the list `l`. For the loop to execute again, `l` must have at least 3 elements, and `x` must be the third element in the list `l`.

The other variables `n`, `m`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, and `s` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `p` is a list containing the value of `c` and `c + x`, `c` is equal to the first element in the list `l` plus the second element in the list `l`, `a` is the second input, `b` is the third input, `x` is the third element in the list `l`, `a` is greater than or equal to 2, `b - a + 1` is greater than or equal to 0. If `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` from index `a - 1` to `b - 1`. Otherwise, `s` is the cumulative sum of the first `b` elements in `l`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, 'YES' was printed. Otherwise, 'NO' was printed.**
