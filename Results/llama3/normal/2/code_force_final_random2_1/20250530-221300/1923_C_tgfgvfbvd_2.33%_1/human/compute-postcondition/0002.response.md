To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `x` and the list `l`. The loop will execute if `l` has at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `l` to have at least one element and `x` to be the first element in `l`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `p` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `_` is 0, `x` is the first element in `l`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**
