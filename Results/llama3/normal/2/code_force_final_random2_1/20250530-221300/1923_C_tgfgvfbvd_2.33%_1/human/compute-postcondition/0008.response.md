Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is an integer, l is an empty list, p is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in the original list l, c is the sum of all elements in the original list l, _ is 0, x is the last element in the original list l, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `l` will be empty because all its elements have been processed, the list `p` will contain the cumulative sums of all elements in the original list `l`, the variable `c` will hold the total sum of all elements in the original list `l`, and the variable `x` will hold the value of the last element in the original list `l`. The other variables `n`, `m`, and `_` remain unchanged, and the input stream `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
