Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, l is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, p is a list containing the value of c and c + x, c is equal to the first element in the list l plus the second element in the list l, a is the second input, b is the third input, x is the second element in the list l, a is greater than or equal to 2, b - a + 1 is greater than or equal to 0. If a - 2 >= 0, s is the cumulative sum of the elements in l from index a - 1 to b - 1. Otherwise, s is the cumulative sum of the first b elements in l. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), 'YES' was printed. Otherwise, 'NO' was printed.**

The code modifies the value of `c` by adding `x` to it, and appends this new value of `c` to the list `p`. The value of `c` is now the sum of the first and second elements in the list `l`. The list `p` now contains two elements: the original value of `c` and the new value of `c` after adding `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
