The only variable in the loop head is variable  x and list l, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list l.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, l has at least 2 elements, x is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the x is the third element in the list.
State: **n is a positive integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, p is a list containing two elements: the first element in l and the sum of the first two elements in l, c is the sum of the first two elements in l, _ is 0, x is the third element in l, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**
