Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is an integer greater than 0, l is an empty list, p is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in the original list l, c is the sum of all elements in the original list l, _ is 0, x is the last element in the original list l, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the cumulative sum of the first b-1 elements in the original list l, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**

The code executes in the following way: The first line assigns the integer values of the next two inputs from stdin to `a` and `b`, respectively. The second line assigns the value of the cumulative sum of the first `b-1` elements in the original list `l` to `s`. Since `l` is an empty list, the cumulative sum is 0. The values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `_`, and `x` remain unchanged. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
