The first line increments the value of `c` by the value of `x`. Since `c` is the first element in `l` and `x` is the second element in `l`, `c` becomes the sum of the first two elements in `l`. The second line appends the new value of `c` to the list `p`. Since `p` initially contains only the first element of `l`, it now contains the first two elements of `l`, with the second element being the sum of the first two elements of `l`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, p is a list containing two elements: the first element in l and the sum of the first two elements in l, c is the sum of the first two elements in l, _ is 0, x is the second element in l, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**
