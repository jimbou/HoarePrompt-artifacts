Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program calculates the cumulative sum of the array `c` and stores it in the array `p`. This is correct because it allows us to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray in constant time.

2. For each query, the program calculates the sum of the subarray `c[a-1:b-1]` by subtracting the cumulative sum at index `a-2` from the cumulative sum at index `b-1`. This is correct because it takes into account the fact that the cumulative sum at index `a-2` includes all elements up to `a-2`, and we want to exclude those elements from the sum.

3. The program then checks if the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray. This is correct because it implements the condition that the sum of the subarray must be greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray for it to be good.

4. Finally, the program prints 'YES' if the subarray is good and 'NO' otherwise. This is correct because it produces the desired output based on the conditions.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions, and it produces the correct output for each query.

Correctness: **True**
