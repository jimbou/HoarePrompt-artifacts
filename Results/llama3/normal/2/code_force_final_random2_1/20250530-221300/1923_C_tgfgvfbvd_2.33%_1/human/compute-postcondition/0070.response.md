State: **`a` is the first input, `b` is the second input, `n` is an integer equal to `a`, `m` is an integer equal to `b - 1`, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in `l`, `_` is 2, `x` is the last element in the list `l`, `m` is greater than 0, `a` is greater than or equal to 2, `b - a + 1` is greater than 0. If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, then `s` is the cumulative sum of the first `b - 1` elements in `l` minus the cumulative sum of the first `a - 2` elements in `l`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s` is greater than or equal to 2 times the value of `b - a + 1` minus the cumulative sum of the first `a - 2` elements in `l`, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
