Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, l is a list of integers, p is an empty list, c is 0, a is the second input, b is the third input, x is the last element in the list l, a is greater than or equal to 2, b - a + 1 is greater than or equal to 0. If a - 2 >= 0, s is the cumulative sum of the elements in l from index a - 1 to b - 1. Otherwise, s is the cumulative sum of the first b elements in l. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
Code of the loop:
for x in l:
    c += x
    p.append(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, l is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, p is a list containing the value of c, c is equal to the first element in the list l, a is the second input, b is the third input, x is the first element in the list l, a is greater than or equal to 2, b - a + 1 is greater than or equal to 0. If a - 2 >= 0, s is the cumulative sum of the elements in l from index a - 1 to b - 1. Otherwise, s is the cumulative sum of the first b elements in l. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, l is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, p is a list containing the value of c and c + x, c is equal to the first element in the list l plus the second element in the list l, a is the second input, b is the third input, x is the second element in the list l, a is greater than or equal to 2, b - a + 1 is greater than or equal to 0. If a - 2 >= 0, s is the cumulative sum of the elements in l from index a - 1 to b - 1. Otherwise, s is the cumulative sum of the first b elements in l. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), 'YES' was printed. Otherwise, 'NO' was printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, l is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, p is a list containing the value of c, c + x, and c + x + c, c is equal to the first element in the list l plus the second element in the list l plus x, a is the second input, b is the third input, x is the third element in the list l, a is greater than or equal to 2, b - a + 1 is greater than or equal to 0. If a - 2 >= 0, s is the cumulative sum of the elements in l from index a - 1 to b - 1. Otherwise, s is the cumulative sum of the first b elements in l. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), 'YES' was printed. Otherwise, 'NO' was printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
