The only variable in the loop head is variable  x and list l, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list l.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, l has at least 1 element, x is the first element in l. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the x is the second element in the list.
State: **n is a positive integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, p is a list containing one element which is the first element in l, c is the first element in l, _ is 0, x is the second element in l, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**
