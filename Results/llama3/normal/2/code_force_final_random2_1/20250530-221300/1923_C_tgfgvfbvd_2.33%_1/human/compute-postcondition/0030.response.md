The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than m, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, m is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again _ must be increased by 1 so _ is 2 and for the loop to execute again m must be greater than 2.
State: **n is a positive integer, m is an integer greater than 2, l is an empty list, p is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in the original list l, c is the sum of all elements in the original list l, _ is 2, x is the last element in the original list l, a is an integer equal to the first input, b is an integer equal to the second input. If a - 2 >= 0, then s is the cumulative sum of the first b-1 elements in the original list l minus the cumulative sum of the first a-2 elements in the original list l. Otherwise, no change is made to s. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
