Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is an empty list, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in the original list `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in the original list `l`, `_` is 2, `x` is the last element in the original list `l`, `a` is an integer equal to the first input, `b` is an integer equal to the second input. If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is the cumulative sum of the first `b-1` elements in the original list `l` minus the cumulative sum of the first `a-2` elements in the original list `l`. If `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and `s` is greater than or equal to 2 times `b - a + 1`, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
