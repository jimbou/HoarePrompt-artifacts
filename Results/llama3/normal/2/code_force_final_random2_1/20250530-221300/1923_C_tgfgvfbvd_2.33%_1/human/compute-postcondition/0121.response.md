Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer, a list of two integers, and a list of integers, followed by a list of queries. It calculates the cumulative sum of the list of integers and then processes each query by comparing the cumulative sum of the elements in the specified range to twice the range size. Based on this comparison, it prints 'YES' if the cumulative sum is greater than or equal to twice the range size, and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not modify the input state and only produces output based on the queries.**
