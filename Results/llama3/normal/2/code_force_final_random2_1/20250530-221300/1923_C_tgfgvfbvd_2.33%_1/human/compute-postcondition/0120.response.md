Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations, and the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the cumulative sums of the elements in the list l, and the sum of all elements in the list l. The loop has also printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each query, depending on whether the cumulative sum of the elements in the list l from index a-1 to b-1 is greater than or equal to twice the difference between b and a plus 1.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has finished executing all iterations, and the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the cumulative sums of the elements in the list l, and the sum of all elements in the list l. The loop has also printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each query, depending on whether the cumulative sum of the elements in the list l from index a-1 to b-1 is greater than or equal to twice the difference between b and a plus 1.
