Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer greater than 0, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of the elements in l, c is equal to the sum of all elements in the list l, x is the last element in the list l, a is the second input, b is the third input, s is the cumulative sum of the elements in l from index b - 1.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the second and third inputs, respectively. The value of `s` is updated to the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` from index `b - 1`, which is the value of `p[b - 1]`.
