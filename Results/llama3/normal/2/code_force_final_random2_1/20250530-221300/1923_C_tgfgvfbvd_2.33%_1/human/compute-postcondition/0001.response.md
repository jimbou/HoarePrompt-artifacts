Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers, p is an empty list, c is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**

The code block reads two lines of input from stdin. The first line assigns two integer values to `n` and `m`, where `n` is guaranteed to be greater than 0. The second line assigns a list of integers to `l`. The code then initializes an empty list `p` and a variable `c` to 0. The variable `_` remains unchanged at 0. After executing the code, stdin contains multiple test cases minus the two inputs that were read.
