Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `x` is the last element in the list `l`, `a` is the first input, `b` is the second input, `s` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` from index `b - 1` minus the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to index `a - 2`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `x`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `s` is updated by subtracting the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to index `a - 2` from its original value, which was the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` from index `b - 1`.
