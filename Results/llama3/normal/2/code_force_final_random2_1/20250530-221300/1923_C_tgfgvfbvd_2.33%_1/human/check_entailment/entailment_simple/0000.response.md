Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. It calculates the cumulative sum of the elements in the list `l` and stores it in the list `p`. This is done to efficiently calculate the sum of elements in any subarray in constant time.
3. For each query, it calculates the sum of elements in the subarray from index `a-1` to `b-1` by subtracting the cumulative sum at index `a-2` from the cumulative sum at index `b-1`. This is done to handle the case where `a` is not 1.
4. It checks if the length of the subarray is greater than 1 and if the sum of elements in the subarray is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray. This is the condition for a subarray to be "good" according to the problem statement.
5. If the condition is met, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and handles all edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
