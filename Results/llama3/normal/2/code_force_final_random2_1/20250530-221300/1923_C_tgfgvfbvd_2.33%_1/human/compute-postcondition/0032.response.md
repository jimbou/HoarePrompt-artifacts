Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is an empty list, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in the original list `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in the original list `l`, `_` is 2, `x` is the last element in the original list `l`, `a` is an integer equal to the first input, `b` is an integer equal to the second input, `s` is the cumulative sum of the first `b-1` elements in the original list `l` minus the cumulative sum of the first `a-2` elements in the original list `l`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `_`, `x`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `s` is updated by subtracting the cumulative sum of the first `a-2` elements in the original list `l` from its previous value, which was the cumulative sum of the first `b-1` elements in the original list `l`.
