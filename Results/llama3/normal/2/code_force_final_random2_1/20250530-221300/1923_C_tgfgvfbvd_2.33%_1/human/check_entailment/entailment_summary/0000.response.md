Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the conditions provided in the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program calculates the cumulative sum of the array `c` and stores it in the array `p`. This is done to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray in constant time.

2. For each query, the program calculates the sum of the subarray `c[a:b]` by subtracting the cumulative sum at index `a-2` from the cumulative sum at index `b-1`. This is correct because the cumulative sum at index `i` includes all elements up to and including index `i`.

3. The program then checks if the length of the subarray is greater than 1 and if the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray. This is correct because a subarray is good if its sum is greater than or equal to twice its length and it has more than one element.

4. If the conditions are met, the program prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. This is correct because it directly follows from the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
