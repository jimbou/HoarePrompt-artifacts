Output State: **a is the first input, b is the second input, n is an integer equal to a, m is an integer equal to b - 1, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in l, c is equal to the sum of all elements in l, _ is 2, x is the last element in the list l, m is greater than 0, a is greater than or equal to 2, b - a + 1 is greater than 0, s is the cumulative sum of the elements in l from index a - 1 to b - 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of a, b, n, m, l, p, c, _, x remain the same as in the initial state. The value of s is updated to be the cumulative sum of the elements in l from index a - 1 to b - 2, which is the original cumulative sum of the first b - 1 elements minus the cumulative sum of the first a - 2 elements.
