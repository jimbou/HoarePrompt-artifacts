Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is an empty list, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in the original list `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in the original list `l`, `_` is 0, `x` is the last element in the original list `l`, `a` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `b` is an integer, `s` is the cumulative sum of the first `b-1` elements in the original list `l` minus the cumulative sum of the first `a-2` elements in the original list `l`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by subtracting the cumulative sum of the first `a-2` elements in the original list `l` from its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
