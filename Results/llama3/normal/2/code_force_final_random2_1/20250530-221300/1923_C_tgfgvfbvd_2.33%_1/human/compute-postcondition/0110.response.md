The only variable in the loop head is variable m, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable m. If m is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, m is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, m must be greater than 2.
State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer greater than 2, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of the elements in l, c is equal to the sum of all elements in the list l, x is the last element in the list l, a is the second input, b is the third input. If a - 2 >= 0, then s is the cumulative sum of the elements in l from index b - 1 minus the cumulative sum of the elements in l up to index a - 2. Otherwise, s remains the cumulative sum of the elements in l from index b - 1. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
