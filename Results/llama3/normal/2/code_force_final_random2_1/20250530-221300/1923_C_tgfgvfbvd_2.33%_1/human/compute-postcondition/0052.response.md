Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to `a`, `m` is an integer equal to `b`, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in `l`, `_` is 0, `x` is the last element in the list `l`, `a` is the first input, `b` is the second input, `s` is the cumulative sum of the first `b - (a - 1)` elements in `l`, `m` is greater than 0, and the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to 2.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by subtracting the cumulative sum of the first `a - 2` elements in `l`, which is stored in `p[a - 2]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `s` now represents the cumulative sum of the first `b - (a - 1)` elements in `l`.
