Based on the precondition, the code will print the string 'YES' because the conditions specified in the precondition (a - 2 >= 0, s is the cumulative sum of the first b - (a - 1) elements in l, a is greater than or equal to 2, b - a + 1 is greater than 1, and s is greater than or equal to 2 times the value of b - a + 1) are all met.

Output: **YES**
