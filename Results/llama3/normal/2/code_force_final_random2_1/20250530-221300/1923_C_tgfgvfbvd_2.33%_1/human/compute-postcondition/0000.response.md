The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and `int(input())`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed `int(input())` must be greater than 0 and _ is 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, _ is 0**
