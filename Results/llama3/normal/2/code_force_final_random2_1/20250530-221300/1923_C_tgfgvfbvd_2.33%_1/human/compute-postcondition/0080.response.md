To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the `range` object created by `int(input())`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are more inputs to process. At the end of the previous iteration, the state of the variables is as described.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

* The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the loop's execution. Its state can be ignored.
* The `range` object created by `int(input())` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Since the loop will execute as long as there are more inputs to process, we can assume that the input has been read and processed in the previous iteration. For the loop to execute again, there must be another input available.

State: **a is the second input, b is the third input, n is an integer equal to a, m is an integer equal to 1, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in l, c is equal to the sum of all elements in l, _ is m, x is the last element in the list l, a is greater than or equal to 2, b - a + 1 is greater than or equal to 0. If a - 2 >= 0, s is the cumulative sum of the elements in l from index a - 1 to b - 1. Otherwise, s is the cumulative sum of the first b elements in l. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
