Postcondition: **a is the first input, b is the second input, n is an integer equal to a, m is an integer equal to b - 1, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in l, c is equal to the sum of all elements in l, _ is 2, x is the last element in the list l, m is greater than 0, a is greater than or equal to 2, b - a + 1 is greater than 0. If a - 2 >= 0, s is the cumulative sum of the elements in l from index a - 1 to b - 2. Otherwise, s is the cumulative sum of the first b - 1 elements in l. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
