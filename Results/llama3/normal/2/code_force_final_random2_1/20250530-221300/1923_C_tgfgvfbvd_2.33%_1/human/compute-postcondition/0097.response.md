Postcondition: ***n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer greater than 0, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of the elements in l, c is equal to the sum of all elements in the list l, x is the last element in the list l, a is the second input, b is the third input. If a - 2 >= 0, s is the cumulative sum of the elements in l from index b - 1 minus the cumulative sum of the elements in l up to index a - 2. Otherwise, s is the cumulative sum of the elements in l from index b - 1. Additionally, either (b - a + 1) is less than or equal to 1, or s is less than 2 * (b - a + 1).***
