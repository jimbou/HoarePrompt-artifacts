Output State: **n is an integer equal to a, m is an integer equal to b, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in l, c is equal to the sum of all elements in l, _ is 0, x is the last element in the list l, a is the first input, b is the second input, s is the cumulative sum of the first b elements in l, m is greater than 0**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `_`, and `x` remain unchanged from the initial state. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to be the first and second inputs, respectively. The variable `s` is assigned the value of the cumulative sum of the first `b` elements in the list `l`, which is stored in the list `p` at index `b - 1`. The constraint that `m` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
