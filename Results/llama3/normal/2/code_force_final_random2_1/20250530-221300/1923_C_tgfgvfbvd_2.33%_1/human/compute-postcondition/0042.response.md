To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `x` and the list `l`. The loop will execute if `l` has at least one element. Since `x` is the last element in the list `l`, for the loop to start, `x` should be the first element in the list `l` at the beginning of the loop. 

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `p` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `_` is 1, `x` is the first element in the list `l`, `a` is the first input, `b` is the second input, `s` is not defined**
