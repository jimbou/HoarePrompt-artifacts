The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_`. If `_` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and the value returned by `int(input())` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1.
State: **n is a positive integer, m is 0, l is an empty list, p is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in the original list l, c is the sum of all elements in the original list l, _ is 1, x is the last element in the original list l, a is an integer equal to the first input, b is an integer equal to the second input. If a - 2 >= 0, then s is the cumulative sum of the first b-1 elements in the original list l minus the cumulative sum of the first a-2 elements in the original list l. Otherwise, no change is made to s. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
