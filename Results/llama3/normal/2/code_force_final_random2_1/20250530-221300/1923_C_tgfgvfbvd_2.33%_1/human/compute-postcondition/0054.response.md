Postcondition: **n is an integer equal to a, m is an integer equal to b, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in l, c is equal to the sum of all elements in l, _ is 0, x is the last element in the list l, a is the first input, b is the second input, m is greater than 0. If a - 2 >= 0, then s is the cumulative sum of the first b - (a - 1) elements in l and a is greater than or equal to 2. The current value of b - a + 1 is greater than 1 and the current value of s is greater than or equal to 2 times the value of b - a + 1.**
