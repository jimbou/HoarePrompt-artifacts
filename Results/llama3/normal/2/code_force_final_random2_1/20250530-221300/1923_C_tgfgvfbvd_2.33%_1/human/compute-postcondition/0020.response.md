Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, m is an integer greater than 0, l is an empty list, p is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in the original list l, c is the sum of all elements in the original list l, _ is 0, x is the last element in the original list l, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the cumulative sum of the first b-1 elements in the original list l. If a - 2 >= 0, then the current value of s is the cumulative sum of the first b-1 elements in the original list l minus the cumulative sum of the first a-2 elements in the original list l. Otherwise, no change is made to s. If the difference between b and a plus 1 is greater than 1 and the current value of s is greater than or equal to 2 times the difference between b and a plus 1, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, either b - a + 1 is less than or equal to 1, or s is less than 2 * (b - a + 1), and 'NO' is printed.***
