Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is an integer greater than 2, l is an empty list, p is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in the original list l, c is the sum of all elements in the original list l, _ is 2, x is the last element in the original list l, a is an integer equal to the first input, b is an integer equal to the second input, s is the cumulative sum of the first b-1 elements in the original list l.**

In this output state, the values of n, m, l, p, c, _, and x remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet. The values of a and b are updated to the first and second inputs, respectively. The value of s is updated to the cumulative sum of the first b-1 elements in the original list l.
