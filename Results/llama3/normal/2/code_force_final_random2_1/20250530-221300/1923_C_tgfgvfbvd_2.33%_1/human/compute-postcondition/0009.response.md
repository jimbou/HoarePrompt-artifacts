The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in the original list `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in the original list `l`, `_` is 0, `x` is the last element in the original list `l`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `m` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is an empty list, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in the original list `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in the original list `l`, `_` is 0, `x` is the last element in the original list `l`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**
