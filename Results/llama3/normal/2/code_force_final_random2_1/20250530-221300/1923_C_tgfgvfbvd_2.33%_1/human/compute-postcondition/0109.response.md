Postcondition: **n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer greater than 1, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of the elements in l, c is equal to the sum of all elements in the list l, x is the last element in the list l, a is the second input, b is the third input. If a - 2 >= 0, then s is the cumulative sum of the elements in l from index b - 1 minus the cumulative sum of the elements in l up to index a - 2. Otherwise, s remains the cumulative sum of the elements in l from index b - 1. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
