Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are integers assigned the values of two integers from the input, `num` is 2 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 3 if `c` is not equal to `r` but the condition in the if statement is true, otherwise `num` is 4, and `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases.***
