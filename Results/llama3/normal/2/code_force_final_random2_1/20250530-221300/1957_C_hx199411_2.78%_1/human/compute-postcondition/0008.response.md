Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and n, `num` is 2, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases, `i` is 0, `c` and `r` are integers, and `c` is not equal to `r`.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to 2, as it was incremented by 2 in the given code. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases, and the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `c`, and `r` are still within their respective ranges.
