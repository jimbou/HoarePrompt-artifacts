Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer between 0 and 3 * 10^5 - k, `i` is 2, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is either 3, 4 or 5, and stdin contains t-k-2 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `num` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 3, 4, or 5. All other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin remains the same, which is t-k-2.
