The code prints the value of `dp[m]`, where `dp` is a list of `m+1` integers and `m` is an integer between `-2*3*10^5` and `3*10^5`, not equal to 0 and not equal to 1. The value of `dp[m]` is calculated using the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^4)`, with initial conditions `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`. Since the exact value of `m` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `dp[m]`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `dp[m]`.

Output: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is 0, m is an integer between -2*3*10^5 and 3*10^5, not equal to 0 and not equal to 1, i is m, c is an integer, r is an integer, dp is a list of m+1 integers with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and dp[i] equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^4), and dp[m] is printed, dp[m] (where dp[m] is the calculated value of dp[m] using the recurrence relation)**
