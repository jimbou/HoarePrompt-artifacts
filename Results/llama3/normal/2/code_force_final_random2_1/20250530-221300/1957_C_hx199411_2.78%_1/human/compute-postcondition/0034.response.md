Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `num` is either 0 or a positive integer, `m` is an integer between 4 and `n` - `num`, `i` is 5, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `dp` is a list of `m+1` integers where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is (dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), `dp[4]` is (dp[3] + (4 - 1) * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), `dp[5]` is (dp[4] + (5 - 1) * dp[3] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented to 5, and a new value `dp[5]` has been calculated based on the previous values of `dp[4]` and `dp[3]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
