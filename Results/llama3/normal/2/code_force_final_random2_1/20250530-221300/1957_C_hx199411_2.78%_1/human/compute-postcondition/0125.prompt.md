Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= n) followed by `k` pairs of integers `r_i` and `c_i` (1 <= r_i, c_i <= n)
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    num = 0
    for i in range(k):
        c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if c == r:
            num += 1
        else:
            num += 2
    m = n - num
    if m == 0:
        print(0)
    elif m == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
        dp[1] = 1
        dp[2] = 3
        for i in range(3, m + 1):
            dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
        print(dp[m])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `num` is a positive integer, `m` is an integer between 0 and `n - num`, `i` is `k-1`, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains `t-1` test cases. If `m` is 0, then 0 is printed. If `m` is 1, then 1 is printed. If `m` is greater than 1, then `m` is an integer between 2 and `n - num`, `i` is `m`, and dp is a list of `m+1` integers where dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, and for all integers `j` between 3 and `m+1`, dp[j] is (dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), and dp[m] is printed, which is the m-th element of the dp list and is equal to (dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7).
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is 0, m is an integer between 0 and 3 * 10^5 - k, i is k-1, c is an integer, r is an integer, num is k if c equals r, otherwise num is 2 * k, and stdin contains t-k test cases. If m is 0, the value 0 is being printed. If m is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If m is larger than 1, a list dp of m + 1 elements is created with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and for all i from 3 to m + 1, dp[i] is equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), and the value of dp[m] is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is 0, m is an integer between -2*3*10^5 and 3*10^5, i is -1 if m is not 0 and 1 otherwise, c is an integer, r is an integer, and stdin contains t-k test cases. The current value of num is equal to the sum of the number of times c is not equal to r plus twice the number of times c is equal to r. If m is 0, 0 is printed. If m is 1, 1 is printed. If m is not 0 and not 1, dp is a list of m+1 integers with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and dp[i] equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^4), and dp[m] is printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
