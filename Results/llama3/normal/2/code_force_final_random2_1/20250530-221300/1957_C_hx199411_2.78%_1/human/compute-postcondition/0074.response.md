Output State: **dp is a list of m + 1 elements, with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, dp[3] equal to (dp[2] + (2) * dp[1] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7) = (3 + 4) % (10 ** 9 + 7) = 7, and all other elements equal to 0, t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is 0, m is an integer greater than 2 and not equal to 0, i is 2, c is an integer, r is an integer, num is 0, and stdin contains t test cases.**

In this output state, the value of dp[3] has been calculated using the given formula, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of dp[3] is now 7, which is the result of the calculation (dp[2] + (2) * dp[1] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7). The other elements of the dp list remain 0, and the values of the other variables are still the same as in the initial state.
