Output State: **dp is a list of m + 1 elements, with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, dp[3] equal to (dp[2] + (2) * dp[1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), dp[4] equal to (dp[3] + (3) * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), dp[5] equal to (dp[4] + (4) * dp[3] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), i is 5, m + 1 is greater than 5**

In this output state, the value of dp[5] has been calculated using the given formula, which depends on the values of dp[4] and dp[3]. The values of dp[1], dp[2], dp[3], and dp[4] remain the same as in the initial state. The value of i remains 5, and m + 1 is still greater than 5.
