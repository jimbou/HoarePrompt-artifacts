Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer between 0 and 3 * 10^5 - k, `i` is 2, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is either 6, 7 or 8, and stdin contains t-k-2 test cases.**

The value of `num` is incremented by 2, so it can now be either 6, 7, or 8. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
