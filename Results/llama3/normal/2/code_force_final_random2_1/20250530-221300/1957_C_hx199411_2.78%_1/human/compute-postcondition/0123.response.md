Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is 0, m is an integer between -2*3*10^5 and 3*10^5 and not equal to 0, i is -1 if m is 1 otherwise i is m, c is an integer, r is an integer, and stdin contains t-k test cases. The current value of num is equal to the sum of the number of times c is not equal to r plus twice the number of times c is equal to r. If m is 1, 1 is printed. If m is not 1, dp is a list of m+1 integers with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and dp[i] equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^4), and dp[m] is printed.***
