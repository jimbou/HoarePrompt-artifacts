Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `num` is either 0 or a positive integer, `m` is an integer between 3 and `n` - `num`, `i` is 3, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `dp` is a list of `m+1` integers where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is (dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7) = (3 + 2 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7) = 7, and `dp[0]` is 0**

The value of `dp[i]` is updated using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, where `i` is 3. The values of the other variables are not affected. The new value of `dp[3]` is calculated using the previous values of `dp[2]` and `dp[1]`, which are 3 and 1, respectively.
