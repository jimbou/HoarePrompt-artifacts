Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is an integer between 0 and n, num is either 0 or a positive integer, m is an integer between 2 and n - num, i is k-1, c is an integer, r is an integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases, dp is a list of m+1 integers where dp[1] is 1 and dp[2] is 3, and dp[0] is 0.**

The code initializes a list `dp` of length `m+1` with all elements set to 0, then assigns 1 to `dp[1]` and 3 to `dp[2]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`, `i`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, containing `t-1` test cases.
