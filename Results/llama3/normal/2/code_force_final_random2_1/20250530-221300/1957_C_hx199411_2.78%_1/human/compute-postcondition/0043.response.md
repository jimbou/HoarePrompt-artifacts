The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, So for the loop to be executed one more time t needed to have been equal or greater than 1 and t currently must be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `num` is a positive integer, `m` is an integer between 0 and `n - num`, `i` is `k-1`, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains `t-1` test cases. If `m` is 0, then 0 is printed. If `m` is 1, then 1 is printed. If `m` is greater than 1, then `m` is an integer between 2 and `n - num`, `i` is `m`, and dp is a list of `m+1` integers where dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, and for all integers `j` between 3 and `m+1`, dp[j] is (dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), and dp[m] is printed, which is the m-th element of the dp list and is equal to (dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7).**
