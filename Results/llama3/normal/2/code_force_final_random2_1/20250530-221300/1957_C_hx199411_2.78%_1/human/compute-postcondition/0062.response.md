Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is 0, m is an integer between 0 and n, i is k-1, c is an integer, r is an integer, num is k if c equals r, otherwise num is 2 * k, and stdin contains t-k test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The value of `t` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the loop.
- The value of `n` also remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the loop.
- The value of `k` becomes 0, as the loop iterates `k` times and `i` is initialized to `k-1`.
- The value of `m` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the loop.
- The value of `i` becomes `k-1`, which is -1 after the loop finishes executing.
- The values of `c` and `r` are the last values assigned to them from the input, as they are not affected by the loop after it finishes executing.
- The value of `num` depends on whether `c` equals `r` or not. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is equal to `k`. If `c` does not equal `r`, then `num` is equal to `2 * k`.
- The number of test cases in `stdin` decreases by `k`, as each iteration of the loop consumes one test case.
