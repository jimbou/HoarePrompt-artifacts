Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `i` is 2, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is 4 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 5 if `c` is not equal to `r` but the condition in the if statement is true, otherwise `num` is 6, and `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been incremented by 2. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is now 4. If `c` is not equal to `r` but the condition in the if statement is true, `num` is now 5. Otherwise, `num` is now 6. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-4` test cases.
