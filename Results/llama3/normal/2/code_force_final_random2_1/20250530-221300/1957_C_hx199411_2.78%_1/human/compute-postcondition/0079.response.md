Output State: **dp is a list of m + 1 elements, with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and for all i from 3 to m + 1, dp[i] is equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), i is equal to m, m + 1 is greater than or equal to m.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of m + 1 elements, where the first two elements are 1 and 3, respectively. For all elements from the third to the m-th, each element is calculated using the formula (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), where i is the index of the current element. The loop variable i is equal to m after the loop finishes executing, and m + 1 is greater than or equal to m.
