Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and n, `num` is 0, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases, `i` is 0, `c` and `r` are integers**.

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The `stdin` now contains `t-2` test cases because one test case has been consumed by the `input()` function. The variables `c` and `r` are assigned integer values from the input, which is a space-separated list of integers.
