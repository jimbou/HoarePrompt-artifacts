The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are integers assigned the values of two integers from the input, `num` is 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 2, and `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases.**
