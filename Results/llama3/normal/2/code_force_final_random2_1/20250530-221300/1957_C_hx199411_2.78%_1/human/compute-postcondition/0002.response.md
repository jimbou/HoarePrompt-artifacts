Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is an integer between 0 and n, num is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= n) followed by k pairs of integers r_i and c_i (1 <= r_i, c_i <= n)**
