Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is an integer between 0 and n, num is either 0 or a positive integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is k-1, c is an integer, r is an integer. If c is equal to r, then num is a positive integer, otherwise num is a positive integer.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, `n` and `k` also remain unchanged, `num` will be a positive integer (either 0 or a positive integer), `stdin` will contain `t-1` test cases, `i` will be equal to `k-1`, and `c` and `r` will be integers. The value of `num` will depend on the values of `c` and `r` in each iteration of the loop.
