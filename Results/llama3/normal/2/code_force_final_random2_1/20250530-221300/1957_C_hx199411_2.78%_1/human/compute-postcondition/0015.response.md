State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 2 and `n`, `num` is either 2, 3 or 4, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 2, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 2, otherwise if `num` was 1, then `num` is 3, otherwise `num` is 4.**
