Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is 0, `m` is an integer at least 3, `i` is 3, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `dp` is a list of m+1 integers with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and dp[3] equal to (dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7), and stdin contains t-k test cases. The value of num is equal to the sum of the number of times c is not equal to r plus twice the number of times c is equal to r.**

In this output state, the value of `dp[3]` has been updated based on the given formula, using the previous values of `dp[1]` and `dp[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t-k` test cases.
