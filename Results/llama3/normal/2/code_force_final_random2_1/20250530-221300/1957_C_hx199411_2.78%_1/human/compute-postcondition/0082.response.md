Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is 0, m is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 - k, is not equal to 0, i is k-1, c is an integer, r is an integer, num is k if c equals r, otherwise num is 2 * k, and stdin contains t-k test cases. If m is equal to 1, the number 1 is being printed. Otherwise, a list dp of m + 1 elements is created with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and for all i from 3 to m + 1, dp[i] is equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), and the value of dp[m] is being printed.***
