Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `num` is either 0 or a positive integer, `m` is an integer between 2 and `n - num`, `i` is `k-1`, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains `t-1` test cases. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is a positive integer and `m` is an integer between `n - num` and `n - 1`, otherwise `num` is a positive integer and `m` is an integer between `n - num` and `n - 1`.***
