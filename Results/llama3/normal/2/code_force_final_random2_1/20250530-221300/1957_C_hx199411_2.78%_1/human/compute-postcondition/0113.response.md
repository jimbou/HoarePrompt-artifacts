Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is 0, m is an integer between -2*3*10^5 and 3*10^5, not equal to 0 and not equal to 1, i is -1, c is an integer, r is an integer, dp is a list of m+1 integers with dp[1] equal to 1 and dp[2] equal to 3, and stdin contains t-k test cases. The value of num is equal to the sum of the number of times c is not equal to r plus twice the number of times c is equal to r.**
