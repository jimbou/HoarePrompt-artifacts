To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `k`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. 

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and n, `num` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `i` is 0**
