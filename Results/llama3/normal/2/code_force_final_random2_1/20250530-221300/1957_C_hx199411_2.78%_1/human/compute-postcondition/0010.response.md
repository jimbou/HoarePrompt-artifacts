The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 2 and `n`, `num` is either 1 or 2, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are integers. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is set to 1. Otherwise, `num` is set to 2.**
