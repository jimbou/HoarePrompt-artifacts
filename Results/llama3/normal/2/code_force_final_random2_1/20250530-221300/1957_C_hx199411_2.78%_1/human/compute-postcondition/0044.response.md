Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is an integer between 0 and n, num is 0, m is an integer between 0 and n, i is k-1, c is an integer, r is an integer, stdin contains t test cases.**

The first line decrements the value of `t` by 1, making it an integer between 0 and 10^4. The second line assigns the values of `n` and `k` from the input, making `n` an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 and `k` an integer between 0 and `n`. The third line initializes `num` to 0. No other variables are affected.
