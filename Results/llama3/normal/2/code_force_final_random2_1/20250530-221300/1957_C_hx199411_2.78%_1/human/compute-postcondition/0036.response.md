Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `num` is either 0 or a positive integer, `m` is an integer between 7 and `n` - `num`, `i` is 7, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `dp` is a list of `m+1` integers where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is (dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), `dp[4]` is (dp[3] + (4 - 1) * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), `dp[5]` is (dp[4] + (5 - 1) * dp[3] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), `dp[6]` is (dp[5] + (6 - 1) * dp[4] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), `dp[7]` is (dp[6] + (7 - 1) * dp[5] * 2) % (10^9 + 7).**

The code updates the value of `dp[i]` where `i` is 7, using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
