Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `i` is 0, `c` and `r` are integers assigned the values of two integers from the input, `num` is 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 2, and `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases.***
