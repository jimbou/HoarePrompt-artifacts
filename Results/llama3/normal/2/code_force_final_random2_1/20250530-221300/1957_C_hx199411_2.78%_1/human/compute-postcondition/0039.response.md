The code prints the value of `dp[m]`, which is an element in the `dp` list. The `dp` list is defined recursively, with `dp[1]` being 1, `dp[2]` being 3, and for all integers `j` between 3 and `m+1`, `dp[j]` is calculated as `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. Since `i` is equal to `m`, the value of `dp[m]` is the `m`-th element in the `dp` list, which is calculated using the recursive formula.

Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the m-th element in the dp list, calculated using the recursive formula)**
