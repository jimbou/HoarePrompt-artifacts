Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 2 and `n`, `num` is either 2 or 3, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 1, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, if `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 2, otherwise `num` is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been incremented by 1. If `num` was 1, it is now 2, and if `num` was 2, it is now 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `num` is 1 if `c` is equal to `r`, and 2 otherwise, is now updated to `num` is 2 if `c` is equal to `r`, and 3 otherwise.
