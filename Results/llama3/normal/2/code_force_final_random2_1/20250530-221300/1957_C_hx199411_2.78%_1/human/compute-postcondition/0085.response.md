The first line decrements the value of `t` by 1. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` becomes an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1. The second line assigns the integer values of the input to `n` and `k`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `n` and `k` become integers between 1 and 3 * 10^5. The third line assigns the value of 0 to `num`. Since `num` is either `k` or `2 * k` depending on the values of `c` and `r`, `num` becomes 0. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, num is 0, m is an integer between 0 and 3 * 10^5 - k, i is k-1, c is an integer, r is an integer, and stdin contains t-k-1 test cases.**
