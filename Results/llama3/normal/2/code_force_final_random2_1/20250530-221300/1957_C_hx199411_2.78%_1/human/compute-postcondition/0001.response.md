To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the condition that must be met for the loop to execute at least once. The loop condition is `while t:`, which means the loop will execute as long as `t` is not zero.

Given that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, we can see that `t` is already guaranteed to be greater than zero. Therefore, no adjustments to the state of `t` are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

The state of `stdin` containing `t` test cases does not affect the loop condition directly, as the loop condition only depends on the value of `t`. Therefore, no adjustments to the state of `stdin` are necessary.

The states of `n`, `k`, `r_i`, and `c_i` are not relevant to the loop condition, as they are part of the loop body and not the loop head.

In summary, since `t` is already guaranteed to be greater than zero, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= n) followed by `k` pairs of integers `r_i` and `c_i` (1 <= r_i, c_i <= n)**
