The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 5, `m` is an integer between 4 and `n` - `num`. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 6 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 6.
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `num` is either 0 or a positive integer, `m` is an integer between 7 and `n` - `num`, `i` is 6, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `dp` is a list of `m+1` integers where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is (dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), `dp[4]` is (dp[3] + (4 - 1) * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), `dp[5]` is (dp[4] + (5 - 1) * dp[3] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), `dp[6]` is (dp[5] + (6 - 1) * dp[4] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)**
