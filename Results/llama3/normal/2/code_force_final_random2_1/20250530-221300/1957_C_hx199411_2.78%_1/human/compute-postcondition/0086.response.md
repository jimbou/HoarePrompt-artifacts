To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `k`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `k-1`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 (the initial value of the range). Additionally, `k` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` must be greater than 0, `num` is 0, `m` is an integer between 0 and 3 * 10^5 - k, `i` is 0, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, and stdin contains t-k-1 test cases**
