Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `num` is a positive integer, `m` is an integer between 1 and `n - num`, `i` is `k-1`, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains `t-1` test cases. If `m` is equal to 1, then the value 1 is being printed. If `m` is greater than 1, then `m` is an integer between 2 and `n - num`, `i` is `m`, and dp is a list of `m+1` integers where dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, and for all integers `j` between 3 and `m+1`, dp[j] is (dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), and dp[m] is printed, which is the m-th element of the dp list and is equal to (dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7).***
