The code increments the value of `num` by 1. The initial value of `num` is 0, so after the increment, `num` becomes 1.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `num` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is 0, `c` and `r` are integers, and the current value of `c` is equal to the current value of `r`.**
