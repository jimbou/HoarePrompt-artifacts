Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is 0, `m` is an integer at least 5, `i` is 5, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `dp` is a list of m+1 integers with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, dp[3] equal to (dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10^4), dp[4] equal to (dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), dp[5] equal to (dp[4] + 4 * dp[3] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), and dp[6] is calculated based on the previous elements**

The code updates the value of `dp[i]` where `i` is 5, using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. Since `i` is 5, `dp[5]` is calculated as `(dp[4] + 4 * dp[3] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
