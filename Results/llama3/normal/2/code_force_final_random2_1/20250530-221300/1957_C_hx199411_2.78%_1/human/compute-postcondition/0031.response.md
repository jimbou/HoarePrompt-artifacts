To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `m`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `m` is at least 3.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `num` is either 0 or a positive integer, `m` is an integer between 3 and `n` - `num`, `i` is 3, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `dp` is a list of `m+1` integers where `dp[1]` is 1 and `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[0]` is 0**
