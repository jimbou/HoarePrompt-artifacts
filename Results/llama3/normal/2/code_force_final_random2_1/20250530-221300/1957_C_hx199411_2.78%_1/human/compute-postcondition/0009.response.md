Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `num` is either 1 or 2, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is 0, `c` and `r` are integers. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is set to 1. Otherwise, `num` is set to 2.***
