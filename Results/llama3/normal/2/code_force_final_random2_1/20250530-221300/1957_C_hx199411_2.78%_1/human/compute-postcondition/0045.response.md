The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `k-1` which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 and `k` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` must be greater than 0, `num` is 0, `m` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `i` is 0, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t` test cases**
