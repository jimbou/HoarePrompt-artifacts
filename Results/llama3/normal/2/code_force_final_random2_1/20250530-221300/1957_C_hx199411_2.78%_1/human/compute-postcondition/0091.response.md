The value of `num` is increased by 2. The previous value of `num` was 0, so the new value of `num` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` must be greater than 0, `num` is 2, `m` is an integer between 0 and 3 * 10^5 - k, `i` is 0, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, and stdin contains t-k-2 test cases. `c` is not equal to `r`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` must be greater than 0, `num` is 2, `m` is an integer between 0 and 3 * 10^5 - k, `i` is 0, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, and stdin contains t-k-2 test cases. `c` is not equal to `r`.**
