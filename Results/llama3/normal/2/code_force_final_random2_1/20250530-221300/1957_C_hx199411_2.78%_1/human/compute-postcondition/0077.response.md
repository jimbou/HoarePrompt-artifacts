The only variable in the loop head is variable i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and m. If i is less than m + 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 4, m + 1 is greater than 4. For the loop to execute again, i must be increased by 1, so i is 5, and for the loop to execute again m + 1 must be greater than 5.
State: **dp is a list of m + 1 elements, with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, dp[3] equal to (dp[2] + (2) * dp[1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), dp[4] equal to (dp[3] + (3) * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), i is 5, m + 1 is greater than 5**
