Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is 0, m is an integer between -2*3*10^5 and 3*10^5, i is -1 if m is not 0 and 1 otherwise, c is an integer, r is an integer, and stdin contains no test cases. The current value of num is equal to the sum of the number of times c is not equal to r plus twice the number of times c is equal to r. If m is 0, 0 is printed. If m is 1, 1 is printed. If m is not 0 and not 1, dp is a list of m+1 integers with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and dp[i] equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^4), and dp[m] is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing all the test cases. The value of t is 0, indicating that there are no more test cases to process. The values of n, k, m, i, c, and r are as described in the output state, and the value of num is the sum of the number of times c is not equal to r plus twice the number of times c is equal to r. The loop has printed the appropriate value for each test case, which is either 0, 1, or the m-th element of the dp list, depending on the value of m.
