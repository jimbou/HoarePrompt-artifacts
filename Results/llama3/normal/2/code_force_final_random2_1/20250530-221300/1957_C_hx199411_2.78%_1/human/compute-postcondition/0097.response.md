Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer between 0 and 3 * 10^5 - k, `i` is 1, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, and stdin contains t-k-3 test cases. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 2. Otherwise, `num` is 3 if `c` is not equal to `r` but was initially equal to `r`, or `num` is 4 if `c` is not equal to `r` and was not initially equal to `r`.***
