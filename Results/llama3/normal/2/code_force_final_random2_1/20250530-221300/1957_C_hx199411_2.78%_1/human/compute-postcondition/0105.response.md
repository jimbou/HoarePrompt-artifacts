Postcondition: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is 0, m is 0, i is -1, c is an integer, r is an integer, and stdin contains t-k test cases. The current value of num is equal to the sum of the number of times c is not equal to r plus twice the number of times c is equal to r.**
