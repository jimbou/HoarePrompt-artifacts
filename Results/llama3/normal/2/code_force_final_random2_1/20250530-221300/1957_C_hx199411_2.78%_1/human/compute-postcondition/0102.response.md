Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer between 0 and 3 * 10^5 - k, `i` is 2, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, and stdin contains t-k-2 test cases. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is either 3, 4 or 5. Otherwise, `num` is either 6, 7 or 8.***
