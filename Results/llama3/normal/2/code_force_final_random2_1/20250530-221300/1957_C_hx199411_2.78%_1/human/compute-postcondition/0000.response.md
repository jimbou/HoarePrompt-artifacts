The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) first and that integer is assigned into `t`. So stdin now contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= n) followed by `k` pairs of integers `r_i` and `c_i` (1 <= r_i, c_i <= n). Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= n) followed by `k` pairs of integers `r_i` and `c_i` (1 <= r_i, c_i <= n).
Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= n) followed by `k` pairs of integers `r_i` and `c_i` (1 <= r_i, c_i <= n)**
