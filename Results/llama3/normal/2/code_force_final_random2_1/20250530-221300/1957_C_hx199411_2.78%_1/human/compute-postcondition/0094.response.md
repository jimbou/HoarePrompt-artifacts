Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer between 0 and 3 * 10^5 - k, `i` is 1, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is 1 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise it is 2, and stdin contains t-k-3 test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The values of `c` and `r` are updated to the two integers read from the input, and the value of `num` is determined based on whether `c` is equal to `r`. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1.
