The code prints the value of dp at index m.
dp is a list of m + 1 elements, with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and for all i from 3 to m + 1, dp[i] is equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), i is equal to m, m + 1 is greater than or equal to m.
Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the value of dp at index m)**
