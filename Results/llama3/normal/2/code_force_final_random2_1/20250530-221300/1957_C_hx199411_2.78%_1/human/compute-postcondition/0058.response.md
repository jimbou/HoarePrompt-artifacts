Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `i` is 2, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is 2 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 3 if `c` is not equal to `r` but the condition in the if statement is true, otherwise `num` is 4, and `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The values of `c` and `r` are updated to the two integers from the input. The value of `num` is determined based on the values of `c` and `r`, and the condition in the if statement. The number of test cases in `stdin` is decreased by 1, from `t-3` to `t-4`.
