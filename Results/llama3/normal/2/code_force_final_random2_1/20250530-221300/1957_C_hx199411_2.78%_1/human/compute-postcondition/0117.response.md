Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is 0, `m` is an integer at least 4, `i` is 4, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `dp` is a list of m+1 integers with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, dp[3] equal to (dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10^4), and dp[4] equal to (dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7).**

In this output state, the value of `dp[4]` has been updated based on the values of `dp[3]` and `dp[2]`, which were previously calculated. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `dp` now contains the calculated value for `dp[4]`, which is a result of the modular arithmetic operation involving `dp[3]`, `dp[2]`, and the constants 3 and 2.
