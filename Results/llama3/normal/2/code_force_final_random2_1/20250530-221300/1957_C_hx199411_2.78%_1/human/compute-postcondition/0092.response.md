Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer between 0 and 3 * 10^5 - k, `i` is 0, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, and stdin contains t-k-2 test cases. The value of `num` is 1 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise it is 2.***
