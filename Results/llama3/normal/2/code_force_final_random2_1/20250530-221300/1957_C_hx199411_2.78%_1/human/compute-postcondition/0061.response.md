Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `i` is 2, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, and `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 3. If `c` is not equal to `r` but the condition in the if statement is true, then `num` is 4. If the condition in the if statement is false, then `num` is 5 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 6.***
