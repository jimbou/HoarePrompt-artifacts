The code prints the value of `dp[m]`, which is the `m`-th element of the `dp` list. The `dp` list is defined recursively, with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, and `dp[i]` equal to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` for `i` greater than 2.

Since `m` is an integer between -2*3*10^5 and 3*10^5, not equal to 0 and not equal to 1, the value of `dp[m]` will be the result of the recursive calculation for the `m`-th element of the `dp` list.

Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the m-th element of the dp list, calculated recursively)**
