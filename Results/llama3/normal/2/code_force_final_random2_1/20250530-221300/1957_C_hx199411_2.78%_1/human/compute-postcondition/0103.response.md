Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is 0, m is an integer between 0 and 3 * 10^5, i is k-1, c is an integer, r is an integer, and stdin contains t-k test cases. The value of num is equal to the sum of the number of times c is not equal to r plus twice the number of times c is equal to r.**

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `k` will be 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The value of `i` will be `k-1`, which is -1, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The value of `num` will be equal to the sum of the number of times `c` is not equal to `r` plus twice the number of times `c` is equal to `r`, indicating that the loop has correctly counted the number of times `c` is equal to `r` and the number of times `c` is not equal to `r`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
