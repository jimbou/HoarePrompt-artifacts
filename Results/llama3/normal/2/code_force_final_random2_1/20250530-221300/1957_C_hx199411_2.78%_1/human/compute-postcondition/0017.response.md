Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 2 and `n`, `num` is either 3, 4 or 5, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is 2, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 3, otherwise if `num` was 2, then `num` is 4, otherwise `num` is 5.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been incremented by 1. The initial state had `num` as either 2, 3, or 4. After incrementing, `num` can now be either 3, 4, or 5. The other variables remain unchanged.
