Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are integers assigned the values of two integers from the input, `num` is 2 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 3, and `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been incremented by 1. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is now 2, otherwise it is now 3. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains `t-2` test cases.
