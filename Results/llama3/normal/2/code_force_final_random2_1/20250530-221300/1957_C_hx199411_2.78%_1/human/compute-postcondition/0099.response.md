Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer between 0 and 3 * 10^5 - k, `i` is 2, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is either 2, 3 or 4, and stdin contains t-k-2 test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `c` and `r` are updated to the two integers read from the input, which are separated by a space. The value of `num` depends on the relationship between `c` and `r`, and it can be either 2, 3, or 4 based on the initial state. The stdin now contains t-k-2 test cases, as one test case has been read.
