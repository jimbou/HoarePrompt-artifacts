Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are integers assigned the values of two integers from the input, `num` is 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 2, and `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The values of `c` and `r` are updated to the two integers from the input. The value of `num` is determined based on whether `c` equals `r`. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 1, leaving `t-2` test cases.
