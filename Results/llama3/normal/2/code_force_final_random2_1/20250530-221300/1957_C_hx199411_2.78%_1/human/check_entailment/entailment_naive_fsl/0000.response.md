Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. It takes into account the number of moves already played and the size of the chessboard, and uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations.

The program first calculates the number of rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks, and then uses this information to calculate the number of possible configurations. It handles the case where there is only one row or column left, and also handles the case where there are multiple rows and columns left.

The program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible configurations. It starts by initializing a list dp of size m+1, where m is the number of rows and columns left. It then calculates the number of possible configurations for each number of rows and columns left, from 1 to m.

The program correctly handles the case where there are multiple rows and columns left, and also handles the case where there is only one row or column left. It uses the modulo operator to ensure that the result is within the range of 10^9+7.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
