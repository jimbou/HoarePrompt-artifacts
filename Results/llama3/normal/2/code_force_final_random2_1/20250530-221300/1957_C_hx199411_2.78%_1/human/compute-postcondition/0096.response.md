Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer between 0 and 3 * 10^5 - k, `i` is 1, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is 3 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise it is 4, and stdin contains t-k-3 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to be 3 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise it is 4, which is 2 more than its initial value. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
