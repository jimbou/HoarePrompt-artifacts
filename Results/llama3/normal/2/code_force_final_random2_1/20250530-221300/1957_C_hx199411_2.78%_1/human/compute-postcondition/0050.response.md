Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` must be greater than 0, `num` is 2, `m` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `i` is 0, `c` and `r` are integers assigned from the input, `c` is not equal to `r`, and `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases**

The value of `num` is incremented by 2, so it becomes 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases.
