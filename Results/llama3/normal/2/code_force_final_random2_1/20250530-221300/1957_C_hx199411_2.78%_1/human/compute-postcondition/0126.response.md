Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the result for each case. It calculates the number of pairs of integers (r, c) where r is not equal to c, and then uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to arrange these pairs in a specific order. The function prints the result for each test case, which can be 0, 1, or a calculated value based on the dynamic programming algorithm.**
