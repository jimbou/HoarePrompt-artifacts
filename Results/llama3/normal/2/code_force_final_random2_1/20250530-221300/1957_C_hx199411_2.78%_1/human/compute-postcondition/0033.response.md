To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `m`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `m` is an integer between 3 and `n` - `num`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `num` is either 0 or a positive integer, `m` is an integer between 4 and `n` - `num`, `i` is 4, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `dp` is a list of `m+1` integers where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is (dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), `dp[4]` is (dp[3] + (4 - 1) * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)**
