Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is 0, m is an integer between -2*3*10^5 and 3*10^5, i is -1, c is an integer, r is an integer, and stdin contains t-k test cases. The value of num is equal to the sum of the number of times c is not equal to r plus twice the number of times c is equal to r.**

The value of m is now calculated as n minus num, where num is the sum of the number of times c is not equal to r plus twice the number of times c is equal to r. The range of m has been updated to reflect this calculation. The other variables remain unchanged.
