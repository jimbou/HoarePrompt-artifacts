Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 2 and `n`, `num` is either 1 or 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 1, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, if `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 1, otherwise `num` is 2.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `i` remain unchanged. The value of `num` is determined by the values of `c` and `r`, which are assigned the values from the input. The `stdin` now contains `t-3` test cases, since one test case has been consumed by the input.
