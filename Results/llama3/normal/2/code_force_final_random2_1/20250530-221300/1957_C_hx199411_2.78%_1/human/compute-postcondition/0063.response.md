Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is 0, m is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 - k, i is k-1, c is an integer, r is an integer, num is k if c equals r, otherwise num is 2 * k, and stdin contains t-k test cases.**

The value of m is updated to be n minus num. Since num is k if c equals r, otherwise num is 2 * k, the value of m is n - k if c equals r, otherwise m is n - 2 * k. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains t-k test cases.
