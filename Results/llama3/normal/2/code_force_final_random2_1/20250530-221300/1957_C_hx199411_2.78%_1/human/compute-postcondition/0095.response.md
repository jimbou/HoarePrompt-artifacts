Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer between 0 and 3 * 10^5 - k, `i` is 1, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `num` is 2 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise it is 3, and stdin contains t-k-3 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been incremented by 1. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is now 2, otherwise it is 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-k-3 test cases.
