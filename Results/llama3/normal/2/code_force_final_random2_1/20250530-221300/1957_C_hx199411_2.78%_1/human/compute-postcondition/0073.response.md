The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If m is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, i is -1 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 2 and m is greater than 2.
State: **dp is a list of m + 1 elements, with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and all other elements equal to 0, t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is 0, m is an integer greater than 2 and not equal to 0, i is 2, c is an integer, r is an integer, num is 0, and stdin contains t test cases.**
