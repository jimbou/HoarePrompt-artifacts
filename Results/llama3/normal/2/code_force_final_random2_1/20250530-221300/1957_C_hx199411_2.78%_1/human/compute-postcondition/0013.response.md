Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 2 and `n`, `num` is either 3 or 4, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 1, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, if `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 3, otherwise `num` is 4.**

The value of `num` is incremented by 2. Initially, `num` was either 1 or 2. After the increment, `num` becomes either 3 or 4. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `num` is 1 if `c` is equal to `r` and 2 otherwise is updated to `num` is 3 if `c` is equal to `r` and 4 otherwise.
