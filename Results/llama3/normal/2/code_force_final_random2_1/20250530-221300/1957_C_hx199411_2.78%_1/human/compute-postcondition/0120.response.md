Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is 0, m is an integer between -2*3*10^5 and 3*10^5, not equal to 0 and not equal to 1, i is m, c is an integer, r is an integer, dp is a list of m+1 integers with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and dp[i] equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7) for all i between 3 and m + 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the value of `i` and the values of `dp` from index 3 to `m + 1`. The value of `i` is now equal to `m`, and the values of `dp` from index 3 to `m + 1` are calculated based on the previous elements in the list, using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
