Output State: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `num` is either 0 or a positive integer, `m` is an integer between 2 and `n` - `num`, `i` is `m`, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `dp` is a list of `m+1` integers where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for all integers `j` between 3 and `m` (inclusive), `dp[j]` is (`dp[j - 1]` + (`j - 1`) * `dp[j - 2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7).

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated from `i` = 3 to `m`, and for each iteration `i`, the value of `dp[i]` has been calculated using the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
