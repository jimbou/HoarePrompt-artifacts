Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` must be greater than 0, `num` is 0, `m` is an integer between 0 and 3 * 10^5 - k, `i` is 0, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, and stdin contains t-k-2 test cases**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `c` and `r` are updated to the integers input from the user, separated by a space. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1, from t-k-1 to t-k-2.
