Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` must be greater than 0, `num` is 0, `m` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `i` is 0, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `c` and `r` are assigned the values of two integers from the input**.

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The values of `c` and `r` are updated to the two integers read from the input, and the number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 1.
