The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer between 0 and 3 * 10^5 - k, `i` is 1, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, and stdin contains t-k-2 test cases. The value of `num` is 1 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise it is 2.**
