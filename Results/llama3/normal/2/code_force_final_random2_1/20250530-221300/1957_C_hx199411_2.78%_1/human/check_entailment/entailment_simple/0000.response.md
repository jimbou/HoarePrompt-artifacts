Reasoning: The program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard after k moves. The program first calculates the number of rows and columns that are blocked by the k moves, and then uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations for the remaining rows and columns. The program handles the case where m is 0, 1, or greater than 1 correctly.

Correctness: **True**
