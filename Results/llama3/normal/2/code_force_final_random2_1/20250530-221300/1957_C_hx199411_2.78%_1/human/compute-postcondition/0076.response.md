Output State: **dp is a list of m + 1 elements, with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, dp[3] equal to (dp[2] + (2) * dp[1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), dp[4] equal to (dp[3] + (3) * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), i is 4, m + 1 is greater than 4**

In this output state, the value of dp[4] has been updated based on the given formula, using the previously calculated values of dp[3] and dp[2]. The other elements of the dp list remain unchanged. The value of i remains 4, and the condition m + 1 is greater than 4 is still valid.
