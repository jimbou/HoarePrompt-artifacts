Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 2 and `n`, `num` is either 2, 3 or 4, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is 2, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 2, otherwise if `num` was 1, then `num` is 3, otherwise `num` is 4.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `i` remain unchanged. The value of `num` is updated based on the values of `c` and `r`. The `stdin` now contains `t-4` test cases, as one test case has been consumed by the `input()` function. The values of `c` and `r` are updated to the integers read from the input.
