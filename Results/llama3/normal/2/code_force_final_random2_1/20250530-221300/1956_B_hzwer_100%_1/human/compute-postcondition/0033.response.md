The value of `ans` is increased by `max(0, x - 1)`, where `x` is the second element of `cnt`. The value of `x` is already used to calculate `ans` in the initial state, so `ans` is increased by its current value. Therefore, `ans` is now equal to `2 * max(0, x - 1)`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains at least one test case minus two lines. The value of `_` is still 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at each index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in `a` and must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element of `cnt`, `ans` is `2 * max(0, x - 1)`, stdin contains at least one test case minus two lines, input is assigned to sys.stdin.readline, _ is 1**
