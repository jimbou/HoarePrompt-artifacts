The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and input. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and input. If `_` is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, stdin contains at least one test case minus two lines. So for the loop to be executed one more time `_` is 2 and stdin contains at least one test case minus one line.
State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at each index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `x` is the last element of `cnt`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, cnt[i] - 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n`, stdin contains at least one test case minus one line, input is assigned to sys.stdin.readline, _ is 2**
