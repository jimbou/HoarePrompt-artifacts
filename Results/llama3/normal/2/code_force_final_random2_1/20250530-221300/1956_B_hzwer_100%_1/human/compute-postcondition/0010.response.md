Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a list of n + 1 integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in the original list `a`, `stdin` contains at least one less test case, `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `_` is 0, `x` is the last element in the original list `a`, `ans` is 0.**

The code assigns the value 0 to the variable `ans`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The variable `ans` is now initialized with a value of 0.
