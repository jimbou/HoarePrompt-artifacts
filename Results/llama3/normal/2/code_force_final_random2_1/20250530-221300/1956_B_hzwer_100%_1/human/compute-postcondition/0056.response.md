The `print(ans)` statement will print the calculated sum of `max(0, y - 1)` for all `y` in `cnt`. 

Since `cnt` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at each index `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`, and `ans` is the sum of `max(0, y - 1)` for all `y` in `cnt`, the print statement will output the sum of the number of occurrences of each integer in `a` minus one, but only if the number of occurrences is greater than one.

Output: **the sum of the number of occurrences of each integer in `a` minus one, but only if the number of occurrences is greater than one**
