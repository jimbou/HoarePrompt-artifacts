Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at each index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in `a` and must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element of `cnt`, `ans` is `3 * max(0, x - 1)`, stdin contains at least one test case minus two lines, input is assigned to sys.stdin.readline, _ is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be three times the maximum of 0 and `x - 1`, where `x` is the third element of the list `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged. The input is still assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, and there is still at least one test case minus two lines in the standard input.
