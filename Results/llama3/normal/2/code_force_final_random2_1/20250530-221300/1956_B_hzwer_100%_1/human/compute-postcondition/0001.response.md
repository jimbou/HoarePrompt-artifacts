To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the input from `sys.stdin.readline`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there is input to read from `sys.stdin.readline`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that there is at least one test case to read.

State: **stdin contains at least one test case, input is assigned to sys.stdin.readline, _ is 0**
