Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in `a`, `cnt` is a list of n + 1 integers where the value at index `x` is 1, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two lines, `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `_` is 1, `ans` is not defined**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[x]` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `cnt` now has a value of 1 at index `x`, which is the first integer in list `a`. The rest of the variables maintain their initial values and properties.
