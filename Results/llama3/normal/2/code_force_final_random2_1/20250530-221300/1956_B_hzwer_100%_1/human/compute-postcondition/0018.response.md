The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the sum of all elements in the list `cnt` minus the number of elements in `cnt` that are greater than 1.
Since the exact elements in the list `cnt` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.
Output: **the sum of all elements in the list cnt minus the number of elements in cnt that are greater than 1**
