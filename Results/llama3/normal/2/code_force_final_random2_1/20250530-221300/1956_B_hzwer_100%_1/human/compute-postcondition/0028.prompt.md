Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, cnt is a list of n + 1 zeros, stdin contains at least one test case minus two lines, input is assigned to sys.stdin.readline, _ is 1, x is 0, and ans is not defined
Code of the loop:
for x in a:
    cnt[x] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in `a`, `cnt` is a list of n + 1 integers where the value at index `x` is 1, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two lines, `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `_` is 1, `ans` is not defined

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in `a`, `cnt` is a list of n + 1 integers where the value at index `x` is 2, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two lines, `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `_` is 1, `ans` is not defined

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in `a`, `cnt` is a list of n + 1 integers where the value at index `x` is 3, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two lines, `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `_` is 1, `ans` is not defined




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
