Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `x` is the last integer in `a`, `cnt` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at each index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `ans` is 0, stdin contains at least one test case minus two lines, input is assigned to sys.stdin.readline, _ is 1**

The code assigns the value 0 to the variable `ans`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The state of the stdin also remains the same, as no input operation is performed. The variable `ans` is now defined and has a value of 0.
