Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at each index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in `a` and must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element of `cnt`, `ans` is `max(0, x - 1)`, stdin contains at least one test case minus two lines, input is assigned to sys.stdin.readline, _ is 1**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of 0 and `x - 1`, where `x` is the first element of `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least one test case minus two lines, and input is still assigned to sys.stdin.readline. The value of `_` remains 1.
