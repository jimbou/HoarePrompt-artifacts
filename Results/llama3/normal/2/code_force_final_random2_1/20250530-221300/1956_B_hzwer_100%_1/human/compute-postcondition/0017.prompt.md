Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a list of n + 1 integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in the original list `a`, `stdin` contains at least one less test case, `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `_` is 0, `x` is the last element in the original list `a`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in cnt:
    ans += max(0, x - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a list of n + 1 integers that must have at least 1 element, `stdin` contains at least one less test case, `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `_` is 0, `x` is the first element in the list `cnt`, and `ans` is either 0 (if `x` is 1 or less) or `x - 1` (if `x` is greater than 1).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a list of n + 1 integers that must have at least 2 elements, `stdin` contains at least one less test case, `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `_` is 0, `x` is the second element in the list `cnt`, and `ans` is either `x - 1` (if the previous `x` was greater than 1) or `x` (if the previous `x` was 1).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a list of n + 1 integers that must have at least 3 elements, `stdin` contains at least one less test case, `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `_` is 0, `x` is the third element in the list `cnt`, and `ans` is either `x` (if the previous `x` was 1) or `2x - 1` (if the previous `x` was greater than 1)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
