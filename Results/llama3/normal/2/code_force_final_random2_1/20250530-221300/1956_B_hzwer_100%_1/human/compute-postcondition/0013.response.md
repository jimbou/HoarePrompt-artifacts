To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables in the loop head and how they change. The loop head is `for x in cnt:`.

Given that `cnt` is a list of `n + 1` integers that must have at least 1 element, and at the end of the previous iteration, `x` is the first element in the list `cnt`, we can infer the following adjustments for the next iteration:

1. **`x`**: Since `x` is the first element in the list `cnt` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `x` must be the next element in the list `cnt`. Given that lists are iterated sequentially, `x` will be the second element in the list `cnt` at the start of the next iteration.

2. **`cnt`**: The state of `cnt` itself doesn't change in terms of its length or the fact that it must have at least 1 element. However, since we've moved to the next iteration, we acknowledge that `cnt` has at least 2 elements because we're moving from the first to the second element.

3. **Other variables**: The states of `n`, `a`, `stdin`, `input`, `_`, and `ans` are not directly affected by the loop head `for x in cnt:`. Their states remain as described at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a list of n + 1 integers that must have at least 2 elements, `stdin` contains at least one less test case, `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `_` is 0, `x` is the second element in the list `cnt`, and `ans` is either 0 (if the previous `x` was 1 or less) or `x - 1` (if the previous `x` was greater than 1).**
