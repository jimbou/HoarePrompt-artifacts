Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at each index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `x` is the last element of `cnt`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, cnt[i] - 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n`, stdin contains at least one test case minus two lines, input is assigned to sys.stdin.readline, _ is 1**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same properties as the initial state, except that `x` will be the last element of `cnt`, and `ans` will be the sum of the maximum of 0 and each element of `cnt` minus 1. This means that `ans` will be the total count of all elements in `a` that appear more than once.
