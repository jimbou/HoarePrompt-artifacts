Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at each index `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `x` is the last integer in `a`, `ans` is undefined, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two lines, `_` is 2**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same `n` value, the same list `a` of `n` integers, and the same `_` value. The `cnt` list will have been updated to reflect the count of each integer in `a`, with the value at each index `x` representing the number of times `x` appears in `a`. The variable `x` will hold the last integer in `a`, and `ans` will remain undefined. The state of `stdin` will also remain unchanged.
