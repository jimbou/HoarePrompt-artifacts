Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n) â€” the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times. input is now assigned to sys.stdin.readline
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = [0] * (n + 1)
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] += 1
    ans = 0
    for x in cnt:
        ans += max(0, x - 1)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a list of n + 1 integers, `stdin` contains at least one less test case, `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `_` is 0, `x` is the last element in the list `cnt`, and `ans` is the sum of all elements in `cnt` minus the number of elements in `cnt` that are greater than 1, and the sum of all elements in `cnt` minus the number of elements in `cnt` that are greater than 1 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at each index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `x` is the last element of `cnt`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, cnt[i] - 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n`, stdin contains at least one test case minus two lines, input is assigned to sys.stdin.readline, _ is 1, and the sum of `max(0, cnt[i] - 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n` which is `ans` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at each index `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `x` is the last integer in `cnt`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, y - 1)` for all `y` in `cnt`, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two lines, `_` is 2, and the sum of `max(0, y - 1)` for all `y` in `cnt` which is `ans` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
