Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a list of n + 1 integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in the original list `a`, `stdin` contains at least one less test case, `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `_` is 0, `x` is the last element in the original list `a`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `a` is empty, and the list `cnt` contains the count of each integer that appeared in the original list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
