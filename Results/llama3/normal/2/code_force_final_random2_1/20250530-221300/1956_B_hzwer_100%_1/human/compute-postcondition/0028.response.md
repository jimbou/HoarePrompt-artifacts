Output State: **n is at least 1, a is a list of n integers, x is the last integer in a, cnt is a list of n + 1 integers where the value at each index i is equal to the number of occurrences of i in a, stdin contains at least one test case minus two lines, input is assigned to sys.stdin.readline, _ is 1, ans is not defined**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the following characteristics:

- The value of `n` will remain the same as it was before the loop started.
- The list `a` will still contain `n` integers, but the loop will have iterated over all of them.
- The variable `x` will hold the value of the last integer in the list `a`.
- The list `cnt` will have been updated to reflect the count of each integer in the list `a`. The value at each index `i` in `cnt` will be equal to the number of times `i` appears in `a`.
- The state of `stdin`, `input`, `_`, and `ans` will remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
