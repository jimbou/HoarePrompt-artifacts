The only object in the loop head is variable `x` and list `cnt`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `cnt`. If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the last element in the original list `a`. So for the loop to be executed the list must have at least 1 element and `x` is the first element in the list `cnt`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a list of n + 1 integers that must have at least 1 element, `stdin` contains at least one less test case, `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `_` is 0, `x` is the first element in the list `cnt`, `ans` is 0**
