Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at each index `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `x` is the last integer in `cnt`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, y - 1)` for all `y` in `cnt`, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two lines, `_` is 2, and the sum of `max(0, y - 1)` for all `y` in `cnt` which is `ans` is being printed**
