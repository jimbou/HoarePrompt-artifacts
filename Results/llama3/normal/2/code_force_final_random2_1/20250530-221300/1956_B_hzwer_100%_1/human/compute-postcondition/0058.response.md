Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at each index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `x` is the last element of `cnt`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, cnt[i] - 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n`, `stdin` is empty, `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, and `_` is the number of test cases.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has finished executing all the test cases. The variable `n` still holds a positive integer value, but the list `a` is now empty because all the test cases have been processed. The list `cnt` still contains the count of occurrences of each integer in the last test case. The variable `x` holds the last element of `cnt`, and `ans` holds the sum of the maximum of 0 and the count of each integer minus 1, which is the result of the last test case. The `stdin` is empty because all the test cases have been read, and `input` is still assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`. The variable `_` holds the number of test cases that were executed.
