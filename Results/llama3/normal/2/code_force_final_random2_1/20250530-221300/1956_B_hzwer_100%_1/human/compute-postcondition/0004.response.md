Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is a list of n + 1 integers where `cnt[x]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains at least one less test case, `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `_` is 0, `x` is the first element in the list `a`**

The code increments the value of `cnt[x]` by 1, where `x` is the first element in the list `a`. Since `cnt` is initially a list of n + 1 zeros, the value of `cnt[x]` changes from 0 to 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
