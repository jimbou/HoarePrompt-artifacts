Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at each index `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `x` is the last integer in `cnt`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, y - 1)` for all `y` in `cnt`, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two lines, `_` is 2**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `n`, `a`, `stdin`, and `_` as in the initial state. The value of `x` will be the last integer in `cnt`, and the value of `ans` will be the sum of `max(0, y - 1)` for all `y` in `cnt`.
