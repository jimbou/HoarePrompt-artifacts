Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at each index `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `x` is the third element in `cnt`, `ans` is `max(0, x - 1) * 2 + max(0, x - 1)`, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two lines, `_` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated by adding the maximum of 0 and `x - 1` to its previous value, where `x` is the third element in the list `cnt`. The values of `n`, `a`, `cnt`, `x`, `stdin`, and `_` remain unchanged.
