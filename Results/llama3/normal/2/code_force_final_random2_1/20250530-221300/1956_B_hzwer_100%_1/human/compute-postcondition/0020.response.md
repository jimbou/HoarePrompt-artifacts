To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.

The objects in the loop head are `_` and `input`. 

- `_` is the loop variable, which is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, so at the start of the next iteration, `_` should be 1.

- `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, which reads a line from the standard input. At the end of the previous iteration, `stdin` contains at least one less test case, so at the start of the next iteration, `stdin` should contain at least one test case.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a list of n + 1 integers, `stdin` contains at least one test case, `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `_` is 1, `x` is the last element in the list `cnt`, and `ans` is the sum of all elements in `cnt` minus the number of elements in `cnt` that are greater than 1**
