Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `cnt` is a list of n + 1 integers where `cnt[x]` is 2 and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains at least one less test case, `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `_` is 0, `x` is the second element in the list `a`**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[x]` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least one less test case, and the input is still assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`. The value of `_` is still 0, and `x` is still the second element in the list `a`.
