stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n) â€” the integers on the cards in your hand. Each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times.
