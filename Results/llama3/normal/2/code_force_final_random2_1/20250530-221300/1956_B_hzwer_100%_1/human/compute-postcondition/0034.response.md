The only variable in the loop head is variable  x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cnt.  If the cnt has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, cnt has at least 2 elements, x is the second element of cnt. So for the loop to be executed one more time the cnt must have at least 3 elements and the x is the third element of cnt.
State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at each index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in `a` and must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element of `cnt`, `ans` is `2 * max(0, x - 1)`, stdin contains at least one test case minus two lines, input is assigned to sys.stdin.readline, _ is 1**
