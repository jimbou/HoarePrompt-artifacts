Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, a is a list of n integers from the second input, cnt is a list of n + 1 zeros, x is undefined, ans is undefined, stdin contains at least one test case minus two lines, _ is 2**

The code first reads an integer from the input and assigns it to `n`. Then, it reads a list of `n` integers from the second input and assigns it to `a`. The third line creates a list of `n + 1` zeros and assigns it to `cnt`. The values of `x` and `ans` are not affected by the code, so they remain undefined. The value of `_` is not affected by the code, so it remains 2. Stdin now contains at least one test case minus two lines.
