Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at each index `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `x` is the second element in `cnt`, `ans` is `max(0, x - 1) * 2`, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two lines, `_` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to `max(0, x - 1) * 2`, which is twice the maximum of 0 and `x - 1`, where `x` is the second element in `cnt`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
