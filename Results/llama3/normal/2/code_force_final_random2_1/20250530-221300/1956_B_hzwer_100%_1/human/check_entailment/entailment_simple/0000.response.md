Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the integers on the cards in the player's hand `a`.
3. It initializes a count array `cnt` of size `n + 1` to keep track of the occurrences of each integer from 1 to `n`.
4. It iterates over the integers in `a` and increments the corresponding count in `cnt`.
5. It initializes a variable `ans` to store the maximum number of points the player can get.
6. It iterates over the count array `cnt` and adds the maximum of 0 and the count minus 1 to `ans`. This is because the player can get points only if they have more than one card with the same integer.
7. Finally, it prints the maximum number of points the player can get.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
