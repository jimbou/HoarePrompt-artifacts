The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since stdin contains at least one test case, `n` becomes a positive integer. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `a`. Stdin now contains one less test case. The third line initializes a list `cnt` with `n + 1` zeros.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers, cnt is a list of n + 1 zeros, stdin contains at least one less test case, input is assigned to sys.stdin.readline, _ is 0**
