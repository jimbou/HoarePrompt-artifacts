The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the sum of `max(0, cnt[i] - 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n`. 

Here, `cnt` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at each index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in `a`. 

So, `max(0, cnt[i] - 1)` calculates the maximum between 0 and the number of occurrences of `i` in `a` minus 1. 

This means that for each number `i` in the range from 0 to `n`, if `i` occurs more than once in `a`, it contributes `cnt[i] - 1` to the sum `ans`, otherwise it contributes 0.

Therefore, `ans` is the total count of occurrences of numbers in `a` minus the number of unique numbers in `a`.

Output: **the total count of occurrences of numbers in `a` minus the number of unique numbers in `a`**
