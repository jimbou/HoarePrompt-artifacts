Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in `a`, `cnt` is a list of n + 1 integers where the value at index `x` is 3, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two lines, `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `_` is 1, `ans` is not defined**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` at index `x` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least one test case minus two lines, and the input function is still assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`. The value of `_` is still 1, and `ans` is still not defined.
