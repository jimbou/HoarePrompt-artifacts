Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player. It uses a frequency array `cnt` to count the occurrences of each integer in the player's hand. Then, it iterates over the frequency array and adds the maximum of 0 and the count minus 1 to the answer. This is because if a number appears more than once in the player's hand, the player can score points by playing the second occurrence of that number.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When a number appears only once in the player's hand, the program does not add any points to the answer.
* When a number appears twice in the player's hand, the program adds 1 point to the answer.
* When a number appears more than twice in the player's hand, the program adds the maximum possible points to the answer.

The program also correctly handles the case when the input is empty or contains only one element.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
