Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in `a`, `cnt` is a list of n + 1 integers where the value at index `x` is 2, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two lines, `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `_` is 1, `ans` is not defined**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[x]` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `x` is still the second integer in the list `a`, and the list `cnt` still has n + 1 integers, but the value at index `x` has been updated to 2. The stdin still contains at least one test case minus two lines, and the other variables `_` and `ans` remain the same.
