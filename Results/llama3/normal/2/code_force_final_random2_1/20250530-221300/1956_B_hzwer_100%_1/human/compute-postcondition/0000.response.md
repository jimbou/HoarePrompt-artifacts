Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n) â€” the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times. input is now assigned to sys.stdin.readline**

The code assigns `sys.stdin.readline` to the variable `input`. This means that `input` will now read input from the standard input (usually the keyboard) one line at a time, instead of reading the entire input at once. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged, as the code does not modify any other variables or the stdin.
