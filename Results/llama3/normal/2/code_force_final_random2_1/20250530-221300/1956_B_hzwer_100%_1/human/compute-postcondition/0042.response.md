Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of at least 1 integer, `cnt` is a list of n + 1 integers where the value at index `x` is 1 and the rest are 0, `x` is the first integer in `a`, `ans` is undefined, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two lines, `_` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[x]` has been incremented by 1, making it 1, while the rest of the elements in the `cnt` list remain 0. The other variables retain their initial values and properties.
