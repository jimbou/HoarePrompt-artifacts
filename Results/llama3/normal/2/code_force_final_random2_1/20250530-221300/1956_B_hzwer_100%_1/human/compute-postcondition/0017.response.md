Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a list of n + 1 integers, `stdin` contains at least one less test case, `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `_` is 0, `x` is the last element in the list `cnt`, and `ans` is the sum of all elements in `cnt` minus the number of elements in `cnt` that are greater than 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `ans` will hold the sum of all elements in the list `cnt` minus the number of elements in `cnt` that are greater than 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
