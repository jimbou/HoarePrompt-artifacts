Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at each index `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `x` is the last integer in `a`, `ans` is 0, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two lines, `_` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been initialized to 0, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least one test case minus two lines, and the value of `_` is still 2.
