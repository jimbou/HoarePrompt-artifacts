Output: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cnt` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at each index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `x` is the last element of `cnt`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, cnt[i] - 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n`, stdin contains at least one test case minus two lines, input is assigned to sys.stdin.readline, _ is 1, and the sum of `max(0, cnt[i] - 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n` which is `ans` is being printed**
