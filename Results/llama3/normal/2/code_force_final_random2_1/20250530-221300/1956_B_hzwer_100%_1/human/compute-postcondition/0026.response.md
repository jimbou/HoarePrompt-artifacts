The only variable in the loop head is variable  x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in `a`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the `x` is the third integer in the list.
State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in `a`, `cnt` is a list of n + 1 integers where the value at index `x` is 2, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two lines, `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `_` is 1, `ans` is not defined**
