Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a list of n + 1 integers that must have at least 2 elements, `stdin` contains at least one less test case, `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `_` is 0, `x` is the second element in the list `cnt`, and `ans` is either `x - 1` (if the previous `x` was greater than 1) or `x` (if the previous `x` was 1).**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated by adding the maximum of 0 and `x - 1` to it. If the previous value of `x` was greater than 1, `ans` is now `x - 1`. If the previous value of `x` was 1, `ans` is now `x`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
