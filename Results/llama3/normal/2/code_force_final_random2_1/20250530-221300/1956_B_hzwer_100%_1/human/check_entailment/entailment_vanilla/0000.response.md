Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases and then iterating over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the integers on the cards in the player's hand.

3. It initializes a count array `cnt` of size `n + 1` to keep track of the frequency of each integer.

4. It then iterates over the integers in the player's hand and increments the corresponding count in the `cnt` array.

5. After that, it initializes a variable `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum number of points the player can get.

6. It then iterates over the `cnt` array and for each count, it adds the maximum of 0 and the count minus 1 to `ans`. This is because if a player has two cards with the same integer, they can get a point by playing the second card.

7. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`, which is the maximum number of points the player can get.

The program's logic is correct and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
