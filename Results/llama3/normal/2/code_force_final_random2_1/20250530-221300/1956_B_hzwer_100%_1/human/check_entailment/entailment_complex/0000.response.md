Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n and a list of n integers. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in the list and calculates the sum of the counts minus one for each integer that appears more than once. This sum represents the maximum number of points the player can get by taking their turns optimally.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It initializes a count array `cnt` of size `n + 1` to keep track of the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`. It then iterates over the list `a` and increments the corresponding count in the `cnt` array for each integer. Finally, it calculates the sum of the counts minus one for each integer that appears more than once and prints this sum for each test case.

The program also handles the input and output correctly. It reads the input from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline` and prints the output to standard output using `print`.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
