Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player. The program counts the occurrences of each integer in the list and calculates the sum of the counts minus one for each integer that appears more than once. This is because for each integer that appears more than once, the player can score points by playing the second occurrence of the integer after the first occurrence has been played by the opponent.

The program also handles the case where an integer appears only once in the list, in which case the player cannot score any points by playing that integer.

The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the number of integers in the list, because it needs to iterate over the list to count the occurrences of each integer. The space complexity is also O(n), because it needs to store the counts of each integer in a list.

Therefore, the program is correct and efficient.

Correctness: **True**
