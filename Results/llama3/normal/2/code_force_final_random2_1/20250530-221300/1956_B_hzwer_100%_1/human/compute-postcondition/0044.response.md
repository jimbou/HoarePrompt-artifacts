The value of `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1. The value of `x` is the second integer in `a`. The value of `cnt[x]` was 1, so the new value of `cnt[x]` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `cnt` is a list of n + 1 integers where the value at index `x` is 2 and the rest are 0, `x` is the second integer in `a`, `ans` is undefined, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two lines, `_` is 2**
