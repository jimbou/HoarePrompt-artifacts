Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of at least 3 integers, `cnt` is a list of n + 1 integers where the value at index `x` is 3 and the rest are 0, `x` is the third integer in `a`, `ans` is undefined, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two lines, `_` is 2**

The code increments the value of `cnt[x]` by 1. Since `x` is the third integer in `a` and initially `cnt[x]` is 2, the new value of `cnt[x]` is 3. The values of the other variables are not affected.
