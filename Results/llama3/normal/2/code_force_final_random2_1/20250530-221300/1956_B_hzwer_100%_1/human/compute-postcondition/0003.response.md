To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `x` and the list `a`. The loop will execute if `a` has at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `a` to reflect this requirement.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is a list of n + 1 zeros, `stdin` contains at least one less test case, `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `_` is 0, `x` is the first element in the list `a`**
