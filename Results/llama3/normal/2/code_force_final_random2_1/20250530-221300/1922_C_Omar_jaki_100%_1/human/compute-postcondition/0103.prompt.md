Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of iterations of the loop, `a` is a tuple containing at least 4 + 4 * number of iterations of the loop elements, `b` is a list containing 2 + 2 * number of iterations of the loop elements, `u` is the first element returned by `r()`, `c` and `d` are the first and second elements returned by `r()` respectively, `v` is `y - x`, `w` is the (4 * number of iterations of the loop - 3)th element of `a`, `x` is the (4 * number of iterations of the loop - 2)th element of `a`, `y` is the (4 * number of iterations of the loop - 1)th element of `a`, `z` is the (4 * number of iterations of the loop)th element of `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases with the number of iterations of the loop less inputs.
Code of the loop:
while u:
    u -= 1
    c, d = r()
    if c < d:
        print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
    else:
        print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of iterations of the loop, a is a tuple containing at least 4 + 4 * number of iterations of the loop elements, b is a list containing 2 + 2 * number of iterations of the loop elements, u is falsy, c and d are the first and second elements returned by r() respectively, v is y - x, w is the (4 * number of iterations of the loop - 3)th element of a, x is the (4 * number of iterations of the loop - 2)th element of a, y is the (4 * number of iterations of the loop - 1)th element of a, z is the (4 * number of iterations of the loop)th element of a, stdin contains multiple test cases with the number of iterations of the loop less inputs. If c is less than d, the difference between the (2 * d - 2)th element of b and the (2 * c - 2)th element of b is printed. If c is larger than or equal to d, the difference between the (2 * c - 1)th element of the list b and the (2 * d - 1)th element of the list b is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of iterations of the loop, a is a tuple containing at least 4 + 4 * number of iterations of the loop elements, b is a list containing 2 + 2 * number of iterations of the loop elements, u is falsy, c and d are the first and second elements returned by r() respectively, v is y - x, w is the (4 * number of iterations of the loop - 3)th element of a, x is the (4 * number of iterations of the loop - 2)th element of a, y is the (4 * number of iterations of the loop - 1)th element of a, z is the (4 * number of iterations of the loop)th element of a, stdin contains multiple test cases with the number of iterations of the loop less inputs. If c is less than d, the difference between the (2 * (d - 1))th element of b and the (2 * (c - 1))th element of b is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the (2 * c - 1)th element of the list b and the (2 * d - 1)th element of the list b is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of iterations of the loop, a is a tuple containing at least 4 + 4 * number of iterations of the loop elements, b is a list containing 2 + 2 * number of iterations of the loop elements, u is falsy, c and d are the first and second elements returned by r() respectively, v is y - x, w is the (4 * number of iterations of the loop - 3)th element of a, x is the (4 * number of iterations of the loop - 2)th element of a, y is the (4 * number of iterations of the loop - 1)th element of a, z is the (4 * number of iterations of the loop)th element of a, stdin contains multiple test cases with the number of iterations of the loop less inputs, and either the difference between the ((d - 1) * 2)th element of b and the ((c - 1) * 2)th element of b is printed if c is less than d, or the difference between the (2 * c - 1)th element of the list b and the (2 * d - 1)th element of the list b is printed otherwise.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
