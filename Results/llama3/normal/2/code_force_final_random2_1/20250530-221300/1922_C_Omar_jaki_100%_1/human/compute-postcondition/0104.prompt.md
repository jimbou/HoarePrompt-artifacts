Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input: an integer, a list of unique non-decreasing integers, an integer, and a list of pairs of unique integers. t is a positive integer.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    r()
    a = -1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0
    b = [0, 0]
    for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
        v = y - x
        b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
    u, = r()
    while u:
        u -= 1
        c, d = r()
        if c < d:
            print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
        else:
            print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 2 times u, a is a tuple containing -1000000000.0, the elements returned by r(), 2000000000.0, and u, b is a list containing two zeros, and multiple more elements, the first of which is the sum of the last two elements of b and v raised to the power of a boolean expression (v > x - w), and the second of which is the sum of the last element of b and v raised to the power of a boolean expression (v > z - y), stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input: an integer, a list of unique non-decreasing integers, an integer, and a list of pairs of unique integers, w is the last but one element returned by r(), x is the last element returned by r(), y is 2000000000.0, z is not defined, and v is y - x, and u is zero, c and d are the first and second elements returned by r() respectively. If c is less than d, the difference between the element at index (d - 1) * 2 and the element at index (c - 1) * 2 in the list b is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element of b and the (2*d - 1)th element of b is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus the number of iterations of the loop and t is greater than or equal to zero, a is a tuple containing at least 6 elements, b is a list containing eight elements, u is false, c and d are the first and second elements returned by r() respectively, v is y - x, w is the last but one element returned by r(), x is the last element returned by r(), y is 2000000000.0, stdin contains multiple test cases with the number of iterations of the loop less inputs.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of iterations of the loop, a is a tuple containing at least 4 + 4 * number of iterations of the loop elements, b is a list containing 2 + 2 * number of iterations of the loop elements, u is falsy, c and d are the first and second elements returned by r() respectively, v is y - x, w is the (4 * number of iterations of the loop - 3)th element of a, x is the (4 * number of iterations of the loop - 2)th element of a, y is the (4 * number of iterations of the loop - 1)th element of a, z is the (4 * number of iterations of the loop)th element of a, stdin contains multiple test cases with the number of iterations of the loop less inputs, and either the difference between the ((d - 1) * 2)th element of b and the ((c - 1) * 2)th element of b is printed if c is less than d, or the difference between the (2 * c - 1)th element of the list b and the (2 * d - 1)th element of the list b is printed otherwise.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
