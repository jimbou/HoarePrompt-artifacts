Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus one and t is greater than or equal to zero, a is a tuple containing at least 6 elements, b is a list containing eight elements, u is the first element returned by r(), c and d are the first and second elements returned by r() respectively, v is y - x, w is the last but one element returned by r(), x is the last element returned by r(), y is 2000000000.0, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input.
Code of the loop:
while u:
    u -= 1
    c, d = r()
    if c < d:
        print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
    else:
        print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus one and t is greater than or equal to zero, a is a tuple containing at least 6 elements, b is a list containing eight elements, u is false, c and d are the first and second elements returned by r() respectively, v is y - x, w is the last but one element returned by r(), x is the last element returned by r(), y is 2000000000.0, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input. If c is less than d, the difference between the elements at indices (d - 1) * 2 and (c - 1) * 2 in the list b is printed. If c is greater than or equal to d, the difference between the element at index 2*c - 1 and the element at index 2*d - 1 in the list b is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus two and t is greater than or equal to zero, a is a tuple containing at least 6 elements, b is a list containing eight elements, u is false, c and d are the first and second elements returned by r() respectively, v is y - x, w is the last but one element returned by r(), x is the last element returned by r(), y is 2000000000.0, stdin contains multiple test cases with two less inputs, and the difference between the elements at index (2*c - 1) and (2*d - 1) in list b is being printed if c is less than d, otherwise the difference between the (2 * (d - 1))th and (2 * (c - 1))th elements of the list b is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus two and t is greater than or equal to zero, a is a tuple containing at least 6 elements, b is a list containing eight elements, u is false, c and d are the first and second elements returned by r() respectively, v is y - x, w is the last but one element returned by r(), x is the last element returned by r(), y is 2000000000.0, stdin contains multiple test cases with two less inputs. If c is less than d, the difference between the element at index 2*(d-1) and the element at index 2*(c-1) in list b is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element and the (2*d - 1)th element of the list b is printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
