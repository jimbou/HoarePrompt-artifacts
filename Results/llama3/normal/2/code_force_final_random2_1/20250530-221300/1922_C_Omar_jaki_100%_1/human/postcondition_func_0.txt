This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a number of cities, their coordinates, a number of queries, and query pairs. It then calculates and prints the differences between cumulative sums of squares of coordinate differences for each query pair, either in ascending or descending order of city indices. The function continues to process test cases until all input has been consumed.
