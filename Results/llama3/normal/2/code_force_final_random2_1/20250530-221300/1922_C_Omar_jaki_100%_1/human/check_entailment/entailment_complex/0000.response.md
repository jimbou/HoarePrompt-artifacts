Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which includes the number of cities, their coordinates, the number of queries, and the query pairs.
2.  It initializes the list `b` with two elements, both set to 0. This list will be used to store the cumulative sums of squares of coordinate differences.
3.  The program then iterates over the coordinates of the cities, calculating the differences between consecutive coordinates and updating the list `b` accordingly. The expression `v ** (v > x - w)` is used to determine whether the current city is closer to the previous or next city, and the corresponding cumulative sum is updated.
4.  After processing all cities, the program reads the query pairs and calculates the minimum number of coins required to travel between each pair of cities. This is done by subtracting the cumulative sum at the starting city from the cumulative sum at the destination city.
5.  The program handles both ascending and descending order of city indices correctly, using the list `b` to store the cumulative sums in both directions.
6.  Finally, the program prints the minimum number of coins required for each query pair.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and it handles all possible cases and edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
