Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of calculating the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities based on their coordinates. The program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the cumulative sums of squares of coordinate differences, which represents the minimum cost to travel between cities.

The program correctly handles the input format, reading the number of test cases, the number of cities, their coordinates, the number of queries, and the query pairs. It then calculates the cumulative sums of squares of coordinate differences for each city and stores them in the `b` list.

For each query pair, the program checks if the city indices are in ascending or descending order and calculates the difference between the corresponding cumulative sums. This difference represents the minimum cost to travel between the two cities.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all the constraints mentioned in the problem description. The use of dynamic programming allows the program to efficiently calculate the cumulative sums, making it scalable for large inputs.

Correctness: **True**
