The only variable in the loop head is variable u, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable u.  If u is true, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, u is false, So for the loop to be executed one more time u must be true.
State: **t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus one and t is greater than or equal to zero, a is a tuple containing at least 6 elements, b is a list containing eight elements, u is true, c and d are the first and second elements returned by r() respectively, v is y - x, w is the last but one element returned by r(), x is the last element returned by r(), y is 2000000000.0, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input.**
