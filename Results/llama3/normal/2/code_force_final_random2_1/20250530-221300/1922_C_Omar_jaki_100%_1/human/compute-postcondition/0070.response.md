The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus the number of iterations of the loop and t is greater than or equal to zero. This does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to t is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of iterations of the loop, a is a tuple containing at least 6 elements, b is a list containing eight elements, u is false, c and d are the first and second elements returned by r() respectively, v is y - x, w is the last but one element returned by r(), x is the last element returned by r(), y is 2000000000.0, stdin contains multiple test cases with the number of iterations of the loop less inputs.**
