Output: **t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 3, a is a tuple containing -1000000000.0, the elements returned by r(), 2000000000.0, and u, b is a list containing two zeros, and multiple more elements, the first of which is the sum of the last two elements of b and v raised to the power of a boolean expression (v > x - w), and the second of which is the sum of the last element of b and v raised to the power of a boolean expression (v > z - y), stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input: an integer, a list of unique non-decreasing integers, an integer, and a list of pairs of unique integers, w is the last but one element returned by r(), x is the last element returned by r(), y is 2000000000.0, z is not defined, and v is y - x, and u is one less than its original value and is greater than 0, c and d are the first and second elements returned by r() respectively, and the difference between the element at index (d - 1) * 2 of the list b and the element at index (c - 1) * 2 of the list b is being printed.**
