Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of iterations of the loop, `a` is a tuple containing at least 4 + 4 * number of iterations of the loop elements, `b` is a list containing 2 + 2 * number of iterations of the loop elements, `u` is the first element returned by `r()`, `c` and `d` are the first and second elements returned by `r()` respectively, `v` is `y - x`, `w` is the (4 * number of iterations of the loop - 3)th element of `a`, `x` is the (4 * number of iterations of the loop - 2)th element of `a`, `y` is the (4 * number of iterations of the loop - 1)th element of `a`, `z` is the (4 * number of iterations of the loop)th element of `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases with the number of iterations of the loop less inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `u` has been updated to be the first element returned by `r()`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The number of iterations of the loop is still unknown, so the sizes of `a` and `b` are still expressed in terms of the number of iterations. The values of `v`, `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are still dependent on the elements of `a`.
