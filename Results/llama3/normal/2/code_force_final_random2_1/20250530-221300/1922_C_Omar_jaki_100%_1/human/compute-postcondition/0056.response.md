Output State: **t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus two and t is greater than or equal to zero, a is a tuple containing at least 6 elements, b is a list containing eight elements, u is false, c and d are the first and second elements returned by r() respectively, v is y - x, w is the last but one element returned by r(), x is the last element returned by r(), y is 2000000000.0, stdin contains multiple test cases with two less inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decremented by one due to the initial state condition and the code execution. The value of `u` has been decremented by one, making it false. The values of `c`, `d`, `w`, and `x` have been updated to the first, second, last but one, and last elements returned by `r()` respectively. The values of `a`, `b`, `v`, and `y` remain unchanged. Stdin now contains multiple test cases with two less inputs.
