Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus one, a is a tuple containing at least 8 elements, b is a list containing two elements, u is false, c and d are the first and second elements returned by r() respectively, v is y - x, w is the last but one element returned by r(), x is the last element returned by r(), y is 2000000000.0, stdin contains multiple test cases with the number of iterations of the loop less inputs.
Code of the loop:
for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    v = y - x
    b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus one, a is a tuple containing at least 12 elements, b is a list containing four elements, u is false, c and d are the first and second elements returned by r() respectively, v is y - x, w is the first element of a, x is the second element of a, y is the third element of a, z is the fourth element of a, stdin contains multiple test cases with the number of iterations of the loop less inputs

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus two, a is a tuple containing at least 16 elements, b is a list containing six elements, u is false, c and d are the first and second elements returned by r() respectively, v is y - x, w is the fifth element of a, x is the sixth element of a, y is the seventh element of a, z is the eighth element of a, stdin contains multiple test cases with the number of iterations of the loop less inputs

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus two, a is a tuple containing at least 20 elements, b is a list containing eight elements, u is false, c and d are the first and second elements returned by r() respectively, v is y - x, w is the 9th element of a, x is the 10th element of a, y is the 11th element of a, z is the 12th element of a, stdin contains multiple test cases with the number of iterations of the loop less inputs




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
