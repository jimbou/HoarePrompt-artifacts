Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus one and t is greater than or equal to zero, a is a tuple containing -1000000000.0, the elements returned by r(), 2000000000.0, b is a list containing two zeros, w is the last but one element returned by r(), x is the last element returned by r(), y is 2000000000.0, v is y - x, u is zero, c and d are the first and second elements returned by r() respectively, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input: an integer, a list of unique non-decreasing integers, an integer, and a list of pairs of unique integers.
Code of the loop:
for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    v = y - x
    b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus one and t is greater than or equal to zero, a is a tuple containing at least 4 elements: -1000000000.0, the elements returned by r(), and 2000000000.0, b is a list containing four elements: two zeros, and two new elements calculated from the previous values of b, v, x, y, w, and z, w is the first element of a, x is the second element of a, y is the third element of a, z is the fourth element of a, v is y - x, u is zero, c and d are the first and second elements returned by r() respectively, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input: an integer, a list of unique non-decreasing integers, an integer, and a list of pairs of unique integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus one and t is greater than or equal to zero, a is a tuple containing at least 5 elements: -1000000000.0, the elements returned by r(), and 2000000000.0, b is a list containing six elements: two zeros, two new elements calculated from the previous values of b, v, x, y, w, and z, v is y - x, u is zero, c and d are the first and second elements returned by r() respectively, w is the second element of a, x is the third element of a, y is the fourth element of a, z is the fifth element of a, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input: an integer, a list of unique non-decreasing integers, an integer, and a list of pairs of unique integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus one and t is greater than or equal to zero, a is a tuple containing at least 6 elements, b is a list containing eight elements, u is zero, c and d are the first and second elements returned by r() respectively, v is y - x, w is the 6th element of a, x is the 7th element of a, y is the 8th element of a, z is the 9th element of a, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
