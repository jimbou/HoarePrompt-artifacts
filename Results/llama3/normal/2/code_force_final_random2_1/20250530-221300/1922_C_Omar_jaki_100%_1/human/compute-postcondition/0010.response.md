Output State: **t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 2, a is a tuple containing -1000000000.0, the elements returned by r(), 2000000000.0, and u, b is a list containing two zeros, and multiple more elements, the first of which is the sum of the last two elements of b and v raised to the power of a boolean expression (v > x - w), and the second of which is the sum of the last element of b and v raised to the power of a boolean expression (v > z - y), stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input: an integer, a list of unique non-decreasing integers, an integer, and a list of pairs of unique integers, w is the last but one element returned by r(), x is the last element returned by r(), y is 2000000000.0, z is not defined, and v is y - x, and u is returned.**

In this output state, the value of t has been decremented by 1. The tuple a now contains the new element u returned by the function r(). The list b remains unchanged. The stdin now contains one less input. The values of w, x, y, z, and v remain the same. The variable u is returned.
