Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, a is a tuple containing -1000000000.0, the elements returned by r(), and 2000000000.0, b is a list containing two zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input: an integer, a list of unique non-decreasing integers, an integer, and a list of pairs of unique integers.
Code of the loop:
for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    v = y - x
    b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, a is a tuple containing -1000000000.0, the elements returned by r(), 2000000000.0, and at least one more element returned by r(), b is a list containing two zeros, two more elements, the first of which is the sum of the last two elements of b and v raised to the power of a boolean expression (v > x - w), and the second of which is the sum of the last element of b and v raised to the power of a boolean expression (v > z - y), stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input: an integer, a list of unique non-decreasing integers, an integer, and a list of pairs of unique integers, w is -1000000000.0, x is the first element returned by r(), y is the second element returned by r(), z is 2000000000.0, and v is y - x.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, a is a tuple containing -1000000000.0, the elements returned by r(), 2000000000.0, and at least two more elements returned by r(), b is a list containing two zeros, two more elements, the first of which is the sum of the last two elements of b and v raised to the power of a boolean expression (v > x - w), and the second of which is the sum of the last element of b and v raised to the power of a boolean expression (v > z - y), stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input: an integer, a list of unique non-decreasing integers, an integer, and a list of pairs of unique integers, w is the first element returned by r(), x is the second element returned by r(), y is the third element returned by r(), z is the fourth element returned by r(), and v is y - x.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, a is a tuple containing -1000000000.0, the elements returned by r(), 2000000000.0, and at least six more elements returned by r(), b is a list containing two zeros, two more elements, the first of which is the sum of the last two elements of b and v raised to the power of a boolean expression (v > x - w), and the second of which is the sum of the last element of b and v raised to the power of a boolean expression (v > z - y), stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input: an integer, a list of unique non-decreasing integers, an integer, and a list of pairs of unique integers, w is the second element returned by r(), x is the third element returned by r(), y is the fourth element returned by r(), z is the fifth element returned by r(), and v is y - x.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
