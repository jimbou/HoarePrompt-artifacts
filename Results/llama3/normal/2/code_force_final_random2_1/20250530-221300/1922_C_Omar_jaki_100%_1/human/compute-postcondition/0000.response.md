Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input: an integer, a list of unique non-decreasing integers, an integer, and a list of pairs of unique integers. t is a positive integer.**

The first line defines a lambda function `r` that reads a line from stdin, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list. The second line uses this function to read the first input, which is the number of cities, and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since `t` is now a positive integer, the number of cities is no longer part of the input state. The rest of the input remains unchanged.
