Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer, then a list of unique non-decreasing integers, then an integer, and then a list of pairs of unique integers. The first integer is the number of cities, the list of integers are the coordinates of the cities, the second integer is the number of queries, and the list of pairs of integers are the queries. The number of cities and the number of queries are positive integers. The coordinates of the cities are non-negative integers. The queries are pairs of unique positive integers such that the first integer is less than or equal to the number of cities and the second integer is less than or equal to the number of cities.**
