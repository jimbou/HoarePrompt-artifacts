Output: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of iterations of the loop, a is a tuple containing at least 4 + 4 * number of iterations of the loop elements, b is a list containing 2 + 2 * number of iterations of the loop elements, u is falsy, c and d are the first and second elements returned by r() respectively, v is y - x, w is the (4 * number of iterations of the loop - 3)th element of a, x is the (4 * number of iterations of the loop - 2)th element of a, y is the (4 * number of iterations of the loop - 1)th element of a, z is the (4 * number of iterations of the loop)th element of a, stdin contains multiple test cases with the number of iterations of the loop less inputs, and this is printed: the difference between the ((d - 1) * 2)th element of b and the ((c - 1) * 2)th element of b**
