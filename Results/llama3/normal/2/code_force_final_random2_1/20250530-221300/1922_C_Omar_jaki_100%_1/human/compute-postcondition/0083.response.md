The code prints the difference between the ((d - 1) * 2)th element of the list `b` and the ((c - 1) * 2)th element of the list `b`. Where d and c are the first and second elements returned by the function `r()` respectively, and d is greater than c.
Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] (where d and c are the first and second elements returned by the function `r()` respectively, and d is greater than c)**
