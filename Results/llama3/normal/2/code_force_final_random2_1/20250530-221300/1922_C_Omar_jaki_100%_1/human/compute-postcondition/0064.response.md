The code prints the difference between the elements at indices `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2` in the list `b`. 

Since `c` and `d` are the first and second elements returned by `r()` respectively, their values are determined by the function `r()`. However, the exact values of `c` and `d` are not provided in the precondition.

The list `b` contains eight elements, but the exact values of these elements are not specified.

Therefore, the output will be the difference between two elements in the list `b`, where the indices of these elements are determined by the values of `c` and `d`.

Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] (where c and d are the first and second elements returned by r() respectively, and b is the list containing eight elements)**
