The code prints the difference between the ((d - 1) * 2)th and ((c - 1) * 2)th elements of the list b.
Since c and d are the first and second elements returned by r() respectively, their values are unknown. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the difference between the ((d - 1) * 2)th and ((c - 1) * 2)th elements of the list b.
Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] (where b[(d - 1) * 2] is the ((d - 1) * 2)th element of the list b and b[(c - 1) * 2] is the ((c - 1) * 2)th element of the list b)**
