The code prints the value of `n`, which is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and is equal to the current value of `k`. Since `n` is larger than or equal to `k` and the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`, the value of `n` being printed is the same as the value of `k`.

Output: **k (where k is the current value of k)**
