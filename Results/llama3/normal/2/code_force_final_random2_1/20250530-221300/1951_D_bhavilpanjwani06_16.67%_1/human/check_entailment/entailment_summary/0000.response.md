Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether it is possible for Alice to buy a certain number of jewels with her available coins, and if so, prints the minimum number of transactions required to do so.

The program first checks if the number of coins Alice has (`n`) is less than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy (`k`). If this is the case, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible for Alice to buy `k` jewels with less than `k` coins.

If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES', '1', and the value of `n`. This is because Alice can buy `k` jewels with `n` coins by spending all her coins on one jewel.

If `n` is greater than `k`, it checks if `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`. If this is the case, it prints 'YES', '2', and the values `n - k + 1` and '1'. This is because Alice can buy `k` jewels with `n` coins by spending `n - k + 1` coins on one jewel and the remaining `k - 1` coins on another jewel.

If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'NO'. This is because it is impossible for Alice to buy `k` jewels with `n` coins.

Correctness: **True**
