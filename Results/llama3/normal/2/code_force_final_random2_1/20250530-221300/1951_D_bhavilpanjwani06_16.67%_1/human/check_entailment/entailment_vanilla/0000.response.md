Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can set up at most 60 stalls and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels. The program takes two inputs, n and k, which represent the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively.

The program first checks if n is less than k. If this is the case, it prints 'NO' because Alice does not have enough coins to buy k jewels.

If n is equal to k, the program prints 'YES' and sets up one stall with a price of n. This is because Alice can buy exactly k jewels if the price of each jewel is n.

If n is greater than k, the program checks if k - 1 is less than n - k + 1. If this is the case, it prints 'YES' and sets up two stalls. The first stall has a price of n - k + 1, and the second stall has a price of 1. This is because Alice can buy k - 1 jewels at the first stall and 1 jewel at the second stall, resulting in a total of k jewels.

If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints 'NO'.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible scenarios. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
