Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18), stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases minus one, and the rest of the lines contain two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought at the end.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the two positive integers read from the input, and the number of test cases `t` is decreased by one. The rest of the input lines remain the same.
