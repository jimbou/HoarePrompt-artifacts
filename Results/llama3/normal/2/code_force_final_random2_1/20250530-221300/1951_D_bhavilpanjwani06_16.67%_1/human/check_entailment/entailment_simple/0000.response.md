Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly handles all possible cases and prints the expected output for each case. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels with less than `k` coins.

2. If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES', 1, and `n` because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins by setting the price of each jewel to 1.

3. If `n` is greater than `k`, it checks if `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`. If this condition is true, it prints 'YES', 2, `n - k + 1`, and 1. This is because Alice can buy `k - 1` jewels with `n - k + 1` coins and then buy 1 more jewel with 1 coin.

4. If the condition in step 3 is false, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the expected output for each case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
