Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 255 and k = 8, the program prints "NO", but the correct answer is "YES" with the following output:

YES
8
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1

This is because the program does not consider the case where k is a power of 2, and n is a multiple of k. In this case, Bob can set up k stalls with prices that are powers of 2, and Alice will buy exactly k jewels.

The program only considers three cases: n < k, n == k, and k - 1 < n - k + 1. However, there are other cases that are not covered by these conditions, such as the case where k is a power of 2 and n is a multiple of k. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
