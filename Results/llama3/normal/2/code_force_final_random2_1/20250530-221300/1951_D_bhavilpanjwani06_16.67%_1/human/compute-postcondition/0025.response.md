Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18), stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases minus one, and the rest of the lines contain two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought at the end. If `n` is less than `k`, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is equal to `k`, 'YES' is printed, and 1 is printed, and the value of `n` which is equal to `k` is being printed. If `n` is larger than `k`, then if `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, then the number 2 is printed, and this is printed: `n - k + 1` and 1. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
