Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18), stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases minus one, and the rest of the lines contain two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought at the end. Additionally, `n` is larger than or equal to `k`. The current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`.**
