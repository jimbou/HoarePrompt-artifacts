Functionality: **This function determines whether it is possible for Alice to buy a certain number of jewels with her available coins, and if so, prints the minimum number of transactions required to do so. It takes two positive integers as input, `n` and `k`, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, respectively. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES', '1', and the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than `k`, it checks if `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, and if so, prints 'YES', '2', and the values `n - k + 1` and '1'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**
