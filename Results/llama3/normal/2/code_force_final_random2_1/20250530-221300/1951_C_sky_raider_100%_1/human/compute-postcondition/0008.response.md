Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer, k is an integer minus n * min(m, k), l is a sorted list of integers, t is n * min(m, k), s is min(m, k), c is the sum of s * (l[i] + (i-1) * min(m, k)) for i from 0 to n-1, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

- The value of `n` remains unchanged, but it must be greater than or equal to 0.
- The value of `m` remains unchanged.
- The value of `k` is reduced by `n` times the minimum of `m` and `k`.
- The list `l` remains unchanged.
- The value of `t` is `n` times the minimum of `m` and `k`.
- The value of `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.
- The value of `c` is the sum of `s` times the sum of the `i-th` element of `l` and `(i-1)` times the minimum of `m` and `k`, for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.
- The value of `i` is `n-1`.
- The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, containing multiple test cases minus 2.
