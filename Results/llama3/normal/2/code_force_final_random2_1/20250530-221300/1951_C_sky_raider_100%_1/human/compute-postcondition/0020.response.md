To determine what will be printed when the `print(int(c))` statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved in the expression for `c`.

1. **n is 0**: This is the starting value of `n`.
2. **i is n**: Since `n` is 0, `i` is also 0.
3. **m is an integer**: The exact value of `m` is not specified, but it's an integer.
4. **k is an integer**: Similar to `m`, the exact value of `k` is not provided, but it's an integer.
5. **k is an integer minus 2^n * min(m, k)**: This seems to be a recursive or incorrect definition. For the purpose of this explanation, let's assume `k` is defined independently of `n`, `m`, and itself, and the given definition is meant to describe a relation rather than a direct assignment. Thus, we'll treat `k` as an integer without a specified value.
6. **l is a sorted list of integers**: The list `l` contains integers in ascending order, but the specific integers are not provided.
7. **t is 2^n - 1 * min(m, k)**: Given `n` is 0, `2^n` equals 1. Therefore, `t` simplifies to `0 * min(m, k)`, which equals 0.
8. **s is min(m, k)**: This is the minimum value between `m` and `k`.
9. **c is min(m, k) * (l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1] + (2^n - n - 1) * min(m, k))**: Since `n` is 0, the sum `l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]` is empty (because we're summing from `l[0]` to `l[-1]`, which doesn't include any elements when `n` is 0). The term `(2^n - n - 1)` equals `(1 - 0 - 1)`, which is 0. Therefore, `c` simplifies to `min(m, k) * 0`, which equals 0.

Given these definitions and the fact that `n` is 0, the expression for `c` simplifies significantly. The `print(int(c))` statement will print the integer value of `c`, which we've determined to be 0 based on the initial state.

Output: **0**
