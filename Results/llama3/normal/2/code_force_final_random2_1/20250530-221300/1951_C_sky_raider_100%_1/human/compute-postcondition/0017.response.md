To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(n):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` is greater than 1, it must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `m`, `k`, `l`, `t`, `s`, and `c` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer minus 4 * min(m, k), `l` is a sorted list of integers, `t` is 3 * min(m, k), `s` is min(m, k), `c` is min(m, k) * (l[0] + l[1] + 2 * min(m, k))**
