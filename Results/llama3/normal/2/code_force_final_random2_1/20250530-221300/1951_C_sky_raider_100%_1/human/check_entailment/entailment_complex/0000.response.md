Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The issue lies in the way it calculates the sum `c`. The program sorts the list of prices `l` and then iterates over it, adding the product of the current price and the minimum of `m` and `k` to `c`. However, this approach does not take into account the fact that the prices of the tickets increase by the number of tickets purchased on each day.

For example, if the prices are `[8, 6, 4, 2]` and we purchase 2 tickets on the first day, the prices for the remaining days become `[10, 8, 6]`. The program does not account for this increase in prices.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to use a more sophisticated approach, such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm that takes into account the increasing prices.

Correctness: **False**
