To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. This means that the only objects in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `m`, `k`, `l`, `t`, `s`, and `c` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `t` is `s`, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is `s * (l[i] + 0)`, `i` is 1**
