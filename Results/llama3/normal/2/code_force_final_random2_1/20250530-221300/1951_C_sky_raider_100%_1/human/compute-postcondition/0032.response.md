Output: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer minus n times min(m, k), l is a sorted list of integers, t is n times min(m, k), s is min(m, k), c is the sum of n times s * (l[i] + (n-1) times min(m, k)), i is n-1, and the integer value of c which is the sum of n times s * (l[i] + (n-1) times min(m, k)) is being printed**
