Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, l is a sorted list of integers, t is 0, s is 0, c is 0, i is 1**.

The code snippet first reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`, respectively. Then, it reads a list of integers from stdin, sorts them in ascending order, and assigns the sorted list to `l`. The variables `t`, `s`, and `c` are reset to 0. The value of `i` remains unchanged as 1. The initial values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `t`, `s`, and `c` are overwritten by the new values assigned during the execution of the code.
