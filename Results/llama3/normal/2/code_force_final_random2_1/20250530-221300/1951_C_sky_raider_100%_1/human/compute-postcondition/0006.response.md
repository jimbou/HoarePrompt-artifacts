To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer minus 2 * min(m, k), `l` is a sorted list of integers, `t` is 2 * min(m, k), `s` is min(m, k), `c` is s * (l[i] + 0) + s * (l[i] + min(m, k)), `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2**
