To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. `n` is an integer.
2. `m` is an integer.
3. `k` is an integer minus `n` times the minimum of `m` and `k`.
4. `l` is a sorted list of integers.
5. `t` is `n` times the minimum of `m` and `k`.
6. `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.
7. `c` is the sum of `n` times `s` * (`l[i]` + (`n-1`) times the minimum of `m` and `k`), where `i` is `n-1`.
8. `i` is `n-1`.

Given these definitions, let's analyze the print statement:

```python
print(int(c))
```

The variable `c` is calculated as the sum of `n` times `s` * (`l[i]` + (`n-1`) times the minimum of `m` and `k`). Since `i` is `n-1`, we're considering the last element of the list `l` in this calculation.

The expression inside the parentheses, `l[i] + (n-1) * min(m, k)`, adds the last element of `l` to the product of `n-1` and the minimum of `m` and `k`. This result is then multiplied by `n` times `s`, which is the minimum of `m` and `k`.

The `int()` function is used to convert the result to an integer, which means any fractional part will be truncated.

Without knowing the specific values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the elements of `l`, we cannot compute an exact numerical value for `c`. However, we can describe the output as the integer result of the calculation involving the sum of products based on the minimum of `m` and `k`, the last element of `l`, and the values of `n` and `s`.

Output: **The integer result of the sum of products involving n, s, the last element of l, and the minimum of m and k**
