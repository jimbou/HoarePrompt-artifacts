Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The issue lies in the way it calculates the total cost `c`. In the problem statement, it is mentioned that if a person purchases `x` tickets on day `i`, all subsequent days will have their prices per ticket increased by `x`. However, in the program, the total cost `c` is calculated by adding the product of the current integer and the minimum of `m` and `k`, without considering the increased prices for subsequent days.

The correct approach would be to keep track of the increased prices for each day and calculate the total cost accordingly. The program should also consider the constraint that a person may purchase no more than `m` tickets per day.

Correctness: **False**
