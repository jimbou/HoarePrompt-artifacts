This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, m, and k. The second line contains n integers. The function sorts these n integers, then calculates a sum c by iterating over the sorted list, adding the product of the current integer and the minimum of m and k, and updating the value of k. Finally, the function prints the calculated sum c for each test case.
