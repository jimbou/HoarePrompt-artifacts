Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer minus n times min(m, k), l is a sorted list of integers, t is n times min(m, k), s is min(m, k), c is the sum of n times s * (l[i] + (n-1) times min(m, k)), i is n-1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

* The value of `n` remains unchanged.
* The value of `m` remains unchanged.
* The value of `k` is reduced by `n` times the minimum of `m` and `k`.
* The list `l` remains unchanged.
* The value of `t` is `n` times the minimum of `m` and `k`.
* The value of `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.
* The value of `c` is the sum of `n` times `s` multiplied by the sum of `l[i]` and `(n-1)` times the minimum of `m` and `k`.
* The value of `i` is `n-1`.
