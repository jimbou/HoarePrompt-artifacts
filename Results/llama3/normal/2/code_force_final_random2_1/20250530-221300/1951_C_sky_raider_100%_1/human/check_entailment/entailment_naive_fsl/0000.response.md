Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets. The problem statement requires that the prices per ticket for each day be increased by the number of tickets purchased on the previous day, but the program does not take this into account. Instead, it simply sorts the prices and calculates the total cost based on the sorted prices, which is not correct.

For example, consider the input:

4 2 3
8 6 4 2

The program will sort the prices to get [2, 4, 6, 8] and calculate the total cost as 2 + 4 + 6 = 12, which is not correct. The correct solution would be to purchase 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4, and then purchase 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6, for a total cost of 10.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to increase the prices per ticket for each day based on the number of tickets purchased on the previous day, and therefore it does not produce the correct result for all possible inputs.
