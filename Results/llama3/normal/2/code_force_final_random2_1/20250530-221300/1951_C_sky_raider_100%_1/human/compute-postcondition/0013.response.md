The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer minus n * min(m, k), `l` is a sorted list of integers, `t` is 0, `s` is 0, `c` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2**
