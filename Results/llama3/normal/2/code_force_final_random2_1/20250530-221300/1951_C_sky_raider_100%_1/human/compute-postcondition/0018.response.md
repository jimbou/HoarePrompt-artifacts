Output State: **n is greater than 2, i is 2, m is an integer, k is an integer minus 8 * min(m, k), l is a sorted list of integers, t is 6 * min(m, k), s is min(m, k), c is min(m, k) * (l[0] + l[1] + 3 * min(m, k) + l[2])**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same. The value of `m` is still an integer, but its exact value is not specified. The value of `k` is now an integer minus 8 times the minimum of `m` and `k`, which is a result of subtracting `s` (which is equal to the minimum of `m` and `k`) from `k` in the third line of the code. The list `l` remains a sorted list of integers, but its elements are not specified. The value of `t` is now 6 times the minimum of `m` and `k`, which is a result of adding `s` to `t` in the second line of the code. The value of `s` is still the minimum of `m` and `k`. The value of `c` is now the minimum of `m` and `k` times the sum of the first two elements of `l`, plus 3 times the minimum of `m` and `k`, plus the third element of `l`, which is a result of adding `s` times the sum of `l[i]` (which is `l[2]`) and `t` to `c` in the first line of the code.
