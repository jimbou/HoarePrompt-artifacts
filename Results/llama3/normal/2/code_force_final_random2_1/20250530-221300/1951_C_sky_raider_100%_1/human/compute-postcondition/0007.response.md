Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, m is an integer, k is an integer minus 3 * min(m, k), l is a sorted list of integers, t is 3 * min(m, k), s is min(m, k), c is s * (l[i] + 0) + 2 * s * (l[i] + min(m, k)), i is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2**

The code snippet modifies the values of `s`, `c`, `t`, and `k`. The value of `s` remains the same as `min(m, k)`. The value of `c` is incremented by `s * (l[i] + t)`, which is equivalent to `2 * s * (l[i] + min(m, k))`. The value of `t` is incremented by `s`, making it `3 * min(m, k)`. The value of `k` is decremented by `s`, making it `an integer minus 3 * min(m, k)`. The values of `n`, `m`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2.
