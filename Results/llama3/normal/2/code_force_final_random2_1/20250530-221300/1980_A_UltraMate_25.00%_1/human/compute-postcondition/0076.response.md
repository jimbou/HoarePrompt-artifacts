Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000, n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, s is a string equal to the third input, p is 'ABCDEF', hmp is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in s that must have at least 6 key-value pairs, stdin contains t-3 test cases, _ is 2, i is the sixth key in the dictionary hmp. If the frequency of 'F' in s is less than m and the frequency of the character represented by i is less than m, ans is either 6m + m - hmp['F'] - 5m + hmp[i] or a multiple of m between m and 6m + m - hmp['F'] - 5m + hmp[i]. If the frequency of 'F' in s is less than m but the frequency of the character represented by i is not less than m, ans is either 6m + m - hmp['F'] - 4m or a multiple of m between m and 6m + m - hmp['F'] - 4m. If the frequency of 'F' in s is not less than m and the frequency of the character represented by i is less than m, ans is either 6m - 5m + hmp[i] or a multiple of m between m and 6m - 5m + hmp[i]. If the frequency of 'F' in s is not less than m and the frequency of the character represented by i is not less than m, ans is either 6m - 4m or a multiple of m between m and 6m - 4m.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `ans` will be determined based on the frequencies of the characters 'F' and the character represented by `i` in the string `s`. If the frequency of 'F' is less than `m` and the frequency of the character represented by `i` is less than `m`, `ans` will be either `6m + m - hmp['F'] - 5m + hmp[i]` or a multiple of `m` between `m` and `6m + m - hmp['F'] - 5m + hmp[i]`. If the frequency of 'F' is less than `m` but the frequency of the character represented by `i` is not less than `m`, `ans` will be either `6m + m - hmp['F'] - 4m` or a multiple of `m` between `m` and `6m + m - hmp['F'] - 4m`. If the frequency of 'F' is not less than `m` and the frequency of the character represented by `i` is less than `m`, `ans` will be either `6m - 5m + hmp[i]` or a multiple of `m` between `m` and `6m - 5m + hmp[i]`. If the frequency of 'F' is not less than `m` and the frequency of the character represented by `i` is not less than `m`, `ans` will be either `6m - 4m` or a multiple of `m` between `m` and `6m - 4m`.
