Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `s` is a string equal to the third input, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that must have at least 1 key-value pair, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 2, `i` is 'F'. If the frequency of 'F' in `s` is less than `m`, `ans` is either 6m + m - hmp['F'] or a multiple of `m` between `m` and 6m + m - hmp['F']. Otherwise, `ans` is either 6m or a multiple of `m` between `m` and 6m.***
