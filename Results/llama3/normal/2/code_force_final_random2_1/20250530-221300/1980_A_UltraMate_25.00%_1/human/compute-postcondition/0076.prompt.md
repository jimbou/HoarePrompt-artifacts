Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 1000, n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, s is a string equal to the third input, p is 'ABCDEF', hmp is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in s, stdin contains t-3 test cases, _ is 2, i is 'F'. If the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F' are not present in the dictionary hmp which contains the frequency of each character in s, ans is 6m. Otherwise, ans is a multiple of m between m and 6m.
Code of the loop:
for i in hmp:
    if hmp[i] < m:
        ans += m - hmp[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `s` is a string equal to the third input, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that must have at least 1 key-value pair, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 2, `i` is 'F'. If the frequency of 'F' in `s` is less than `m`, `ans` is either 6m + m - hmp['F'] or a multiple of `m` between `m` and 6m + m - hmp['F']. Otherwise, `ans` is either 6m or a multiple of `m` between `m` and 6m.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `s` is a string equal to the third input, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 2, `i` is the second key in the dictionary `hmp`. If the frequency of 'F' in `s` is less than `m` and the frequency of the character represented by `i` is less than `m`, `ans` is either 6m + m - hmp['F'] - m + hmp[i] or a multiple of `m` between `m` and 6m + m - hmp['F'] - m + hmp[i]. If the frequency of 'F' in `s` is less than `m` but the frequency of the character represented by `i` is not less than `m`, `ans` is either 6m + m - hmp['F'] or a multiple of `m` between `m` and 6m + m - hmp['F']. If the frequency of 'F' in `s` is not less than `m` and the frequency of the character represented by `i` is less than `m`, `ans` is either 6m - m + hmp[i] or a multiple of `m` between `m` and 6m - m + hmp[i]. If the frequency of 'F' in `s` is not less than `m` and the frequency of the character represented by `i` is not less than `m`, `ans` is either 6m or a multiple of `m` between `m` and 6m.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `s` is a string equal to the third input, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that must have at least 3 key-value pairs, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 2, `i` is the third key in the dictionary `hmp`. If the frequency of 'F' in `s` is less than `m` and the frequency of the character represented by `i` is less than `m`, `ans` is either 6m + m - hmp['F'] - 2m + hmp[i] or a multiple of `m` between `m` and 6m + m - hmp['F'] - 2m + hmp[i]. If the frequency of 'F' in `s` is less than `m` but the frequency of the character represented by `i` is not less than `m`, `ans` is either 6m + m - hmp['F'] - m or a multiple of `m` between `m` and 6m + m - hmp['F'] - m. If the frequency of 'F' in `s` is not less than `m` and the frequency of the character represented by `i` is less than `m`, `ans` is either 6m - 2m + hmp[i] or a multiple of `m` between `m` and 6m - 2m + hmp[i]. If the frequency of 'F' in `s` is not less than `m` and the frequency of the character represented by `i` is not less than `m`, `ans` is either 6m - m or a multiple of `m` between `m` and 6m - m.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
