Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF' and is empty, `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that must not be empty, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `i` is the first key in the dictionary `hmp`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`**.

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding the difference between `m` and the frequency of the character `i` in the string `s`, which is stored in the dictionary `hmp`. The other variables remain unchanged. The frequency of the character `i` in `s` is still less than `m`, but the value of `ans` has been increased accordingly.
