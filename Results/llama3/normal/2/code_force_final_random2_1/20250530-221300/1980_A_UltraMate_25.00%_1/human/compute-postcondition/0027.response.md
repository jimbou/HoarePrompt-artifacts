The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF' and is empty, `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `_` is 1, `i` is the last key in the dictionary `hmp`**
