Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `s` is a string equal to the third input, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that must have at least 1 key-value pair, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 1, `i` is the first key in the dictionary `hmp`, and the current value of `ans` is either 6m if none of the characters in the string `p` are keys in the dictionary `hmp`, or the sum of `m` for each character in the string `p` that is not a key in the dictionary `hmp`. Additionally, the frequency of the character `i` in the string `s`, as stored in the dictionary `hmp`, is less than the value of `m`.**
