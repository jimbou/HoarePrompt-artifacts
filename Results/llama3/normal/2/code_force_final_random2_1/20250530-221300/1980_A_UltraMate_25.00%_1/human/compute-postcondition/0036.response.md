To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `i` and the string `p`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters in the string `p`. At the end of the previous iteration, `p` must have at least 2 characters. For the loop to execute again, `p` must have at least 3 characters.

Since `i` is the loop variable, it will take on the value of the next character in the string `p` at the start of the next iteration.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `s` is a string equal to the third input, `p` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 1, `i` is the second character in the string `p`**

Note that the values of `ans` are not adjusted as it is not a variable in the loop head.
