Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `s` is a string equal to the third input, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 2, `ans` is `2m` if the character 'A' is not present in the dictionary `hmp` which contains the frequency of each character in `s`, `i` is 'B'.**

The value of `ans` is increased by `m`. The previous value of `ans` was `m` if the character 'A' is not present in the dictionary `hmp` which contains the frequency of each character in `s`. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `2m` if the character 'A' is not present in the dictionary `hmp` which contains the frequency of each character in `s`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
