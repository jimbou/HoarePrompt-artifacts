Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5). The second line contains a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    ans = 0
    p = 'ABCDEF'
    hmp = Counter(s)
    for i in p:
        if i not in hmp:
            ans += m
    for i in hmp:
        if hmp[i] < m:
            ans += m - hmp[i]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF' and is empty, `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `i` is the last key in the dictionary `hmp`. If the frequency of any character in `hmp` is less than `m`, then `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]` for each such character, and the value of `ans` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 1000, n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, s is a string equal to the third input, p is 'ABCDEF', hmp is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in s, stdin contains t-3 test cases, _ is 1, i is the last key in the dictionary hmp, ans is either 6m if none of the characters in the string p are keys in the dictionary hmp, or the sum of m for each character in the string p that is not a key in the dictionary hmp plus the sum of m minus the frequency of each character in the string s that is a key in the dictionary hmp and has a frequency less than m, and ans is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 1000, n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, s is a string equal to the third input, p is 'ABCDEF', hmp is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in s that must have at least 6 key-value pairs, stdin contains t-3 test cases, _ is 2, i is the sixth key in the dictionary hmp. If the frequency of 'F' in s is less than m and the frequency of the character represented by i is less than m, ans is either 6m + m - hmp['F'] - 5m + hmp[i] or a multiple of m between m and 6m + m - hmp['F'] - 5m + hmp[i]. If the frequency of 'F' in s is less than m but the frequency of the character represented by i is not less than m, ans is either 6m + m - hmp['F'] - 4m or a multiple of m between m and 6m + m - hmp['F'] - 4m. If the frequency of 'F' in s is not less than m and the frequency of the character represented by i is less than m, ans is either 6m - 5m + hmp[i] or a multiple of m between m and 6m - 5m + hmp[i]. If the frequency of 'F' in s is not less than m and the frequency of the character represented by i is not less than m, ans is either 6m - 4m or a multiple of m between m and 6m - 4m, and ans is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
