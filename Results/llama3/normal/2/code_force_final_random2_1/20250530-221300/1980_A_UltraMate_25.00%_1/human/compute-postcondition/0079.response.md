Output State: **t is an integer equal to 0, n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, s is a string equal to the third input, p is 'ABCDEF', hmp is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in s that must have at least 6 key-value pairs, stdin contains 0 test cases, _ is t-1, i is the last key in the dictionary hmp. If the frequency of any character in the string p is less than m, ans is either 6m if none of the characters in the string p are keys in the dictionary hmp, or the sum of m for each character in the string p that is not a key in the dictionary hmp plus the sum of m minus the frequency of each character in the string s that is a key in the dictionary hmp and has a frequency less than m, and ans is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the number of test cases (t) will be 0, and the values of n, m, and s will be the same as the first input. The dictionary hmp will contain the frequency of each character in the string s, and the string p will still be 'ABCDEF'. The variable _ will be equal to t-1, and the variable i will be the last key in the dictionary hmp. The value of ans will be either 6m (if none of the characters in the string p are keys in the dictionary hmp) or the sum of m for each character in the string p that is not a key in the dictionary hmp plus the sum of m minus the frequency of each character in the string s that is a key in the dictionary hmp and has a frequency less than m. The value of ans will be printed.
