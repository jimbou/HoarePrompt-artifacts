Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000, n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, s is a string equal to the third input, p is a string that must have at least 2 characters, hmp is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in s, stdin contains t-3 test cases, _ is 1, if the first character in the string p is not a key in the dictionary hmp then ans is 2m, otherwise ans is m, i is the second character in the string p**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated based on its previous value and the value of `m`. If the first character in the string `p` is not a key in the dictionary `hmp`, then `ans` is now equal to `2m`, otherwise `ans` is now equal to `m`. All other variables remain unchanged.
