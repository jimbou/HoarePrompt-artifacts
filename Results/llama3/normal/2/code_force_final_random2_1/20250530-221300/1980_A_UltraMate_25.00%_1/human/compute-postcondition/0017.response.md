Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF' and is empty, `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that must not be empty, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `i` is the first key in the dictionary `hmp`. If the frequency of the first character in `hmp` is less than `m`, then `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.***
