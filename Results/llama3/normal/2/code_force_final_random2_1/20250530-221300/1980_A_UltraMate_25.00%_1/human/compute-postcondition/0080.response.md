Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the total number of characters needed to make the frequency of each character in the string 'ABCDEF' at least 'm' in the given string 's'. It calculates this by summing the difference between 'm' and the frequency of each character in 's' that is less than 'm', and adding 'm' for each character in 'ABCDEF' that does not appear in 's'. The function then prints the total count for each test case.**
