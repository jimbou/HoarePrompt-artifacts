Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000, n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, s is a string equal to the third input, p is 'ABCDEF', hmp is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in s, stdin contains t-3 test cases, _ is 2, i is 'F'. If the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F' are not present in the dictionary hmp which contains the frequency of each character in s, ans is 6m. Otherwise, ans is a multiple of m between m and 6m.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables t, n, m, s, p, hmp, stdin, and _ remain unchanged. The variable i is now 'F', which is the last character in the string p. The variable ans is a multiple of m, ranging from m to 6m, depending on how many characters from the string p are not present in the dictionary hmp. If all characters from p are not present in hmp, ans is 6m. If some characters from p are present in hmp, ans is a multiple of m less than 6m.
