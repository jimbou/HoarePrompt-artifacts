To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for i in p:`, where `p` is a string `'ABCDEF'` and `i` is the first character in `p`.

According to the loop head, the loop will iterate over each character in the string `p`. Since `i` is the first character in `p`, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be the next character in `p`.

The current state is:
`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is `'ABCDEF'` and is not empty, `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `i` is the first character in `p`. If the first character in `p` is not present in the dictionary `hmp`, then `ans` is `m`.

Since `i` is the first character in `p`, which is `'A'`, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be the next character in `p`, which is `'B'`.

The state of other variables remains the same, as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF' and is not empty, `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `i` is 'B'**
