The code prints the value of `ans`, which is either 6 times the value of `m` if none of the characters in the string `p` are keys in the dictionary `hmp`, or the sum of `m` for each character in the string `p` that is not a key in the dictionary `hmp` plus the sum of `m` minus the frequency of each character in the string `s` that is a key in the dictionary `hmp` and has a frequency less than `m`.

Since the exact values of `m`, `p`, `hmp`, and `s` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000, n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, s is a string equal to the third input, p is 'ABCDEF', hmp is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in s, stdin contains t-3 test cases, _ is 1, i is the last key in the dictionary hmp, ans is either 6m if none of the characters in the string p are keys in the dictionary hmp, or the sum of m for each character in the string p that is not a key in the dictionary hmp plus the sum of m minus the frequency of each character in the string s that is a key in the dictionary hmp and has a frequency less than m, and ans is printed**
