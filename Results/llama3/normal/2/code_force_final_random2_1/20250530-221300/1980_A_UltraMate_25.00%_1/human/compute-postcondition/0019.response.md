Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF' and is empty, `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that must have at least 2 keys, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `i` is the second key in the dictionary `hmp`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]` if the frequency of the second character in `hmp` is less than `m`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is increased by the difference between `m` and the frequency of the second character in the string `s` if this frequency is less than `m`. The other variables remain unchanged.
