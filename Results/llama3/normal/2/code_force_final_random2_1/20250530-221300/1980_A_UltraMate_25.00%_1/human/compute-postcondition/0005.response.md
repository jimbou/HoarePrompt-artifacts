The code `ans += m` increments the value of `ans` by `m`. The initial value of `ans` is 0, so the new value of `ans` will be `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `ans` is `m`, `p` is 'ABCDEF' and is not empty, `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s`, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `i` is the first character in `p`, and the current value of `i` is not present in the dictionary `hmp**
