Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `s` is a string equal to the third input, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 2, `i` is 'A', `ans` is `m`, and the character 'A' is not present in the dictionary `hmp` which contains the frequency of each character in `s`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to `m`, which is an integer equal to the second input. All other variables remain unchanged, including `t`, `n`, `s`, `p`, `hmp`, `stdin`, `_`, and `i`. The character 'A' is still not present in the dictionary `hmp`.
