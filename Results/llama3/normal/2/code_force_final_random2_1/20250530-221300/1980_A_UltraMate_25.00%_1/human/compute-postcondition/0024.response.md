Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEF' and is empty, `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `i` is the last key in the dictionary `hmp`. If the frequency of any character in `hmp` is less than `m`, then `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]` for each such character.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `p`, `stdin`, and `_` as in the initial state. The dictionary `hmp` will still contain the frequency of each character in `s`, but the loop will have iterated over all characters in `hmp`. The variable `i` will be the last key in the dictionary `hmp`. The value of `ans` will be increased by `m - hmp[i]` for each character in `hmp` whose frequency is less than `m`.
