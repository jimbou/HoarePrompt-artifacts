Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000, n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, s is a string equal to the third input, p is 'ABCDEF', hmp is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in s, stdin contains t-3 test cases, _ is 2, i is the last key in the dictionary hmp, ans is 0**

The code block reads the first two inputs from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `m`, respectively. It then reads the third input from stdin and assigns it to `s`. The string `p` is assigned the value 'ABCDEF'. The dictionary `hmp` is created using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module, which counts the frequency of each character in the string `s`. The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. 

Note that the variable `i` is not explicitly assigned a value in the code, but based on the initial state, it is mentioned that `i` is the last key in the dictionary `hmp`. However, since the dictionary `hmp` is recreated in the code, the value of `i` is not updated. 

Also, the variable `ans` is not calculated in the given code block, but based on the initial state, it is mentioned that `ans` is either 6m or the sum of m for each character in the string p that is not a key in the dictionary hmp plus the sum of m minus the frequency of each character in the string s that is a key in the dictionary hmp and has a frequency less than m. However, this calculation is not performed in the given code block.
