Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `s` is a string equal to the third input, `p` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 1, `i` is the first character in the string `p`, `ans` is `m`, and the current value of `i` is not a key in the dictionary `hmp`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be equal to `m`, which is the second input. All other variables remain unchanged, including `t`, `n`, `s`, `p`, `hmp`, `stdin`, `_`, and `i`. The relationship between `i` and `hmp` also remains the same, where the current value of `i` is not a key in the dictionary `hmp`.
