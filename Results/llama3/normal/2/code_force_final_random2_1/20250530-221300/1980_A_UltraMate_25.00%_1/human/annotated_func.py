#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5). The second line contains a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G'.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        ans = 0
        
        p = 'ABCDEF'
        
        hmp = Counter(s)
        
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
        
        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: t is an integer equal to 0, n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, s is a string equal to the third input, p is 'ABCDEF', hmp is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in s that must have at least 6 key-value pairs, stdin contains 0 test cases, _ is t-1, i is the last key in the dictionary hmp. If the frequency of any character in the string p is less than m, ans is either 6m if none of the characters in the string p are keys in the dictionary hmp, or the sum of m for each character in the string p that is not a key in the dictionary hmp plus the sum of m minus the frequency of each character in the string s that is a key in the dictionary hmp and has a frequency less than m, and ans is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the total number of characters needed to make the frequency of each character in the string 'ABCDEF' at least 'm' in the given string 's'. It calculates this by summing the difference between 'm' and the frequency of each character in 's' that is less than 'm', and adding 'm' for each character in 'ABCDEF' that does not appear in 's'. The function then prints the total count for each test case.
