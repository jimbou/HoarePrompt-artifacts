Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `s` is a string equal to the third input, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that must have at least 1 key-value pair, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 2, `i` is 'F', `ans` is either 6m + m - hmp['F'] or a multiple of `m` between `m` and 6m + m - hmp['F']**.

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `m - hmp[i]` to its previous value. Since `i` is 'F', `hmp[i]` is the frequency of 'F' in the string `s`. The value of `ans` is now either 6m + m - hmp['F'] or a multiple of `m` between `m` and 6m + m - hmp['F']. The other variables remain unchanged.
