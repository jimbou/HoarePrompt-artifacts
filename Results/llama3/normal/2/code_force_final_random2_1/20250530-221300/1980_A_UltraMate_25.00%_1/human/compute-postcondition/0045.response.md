Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `s` is a string equal to the third input, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 1, `i` is the second key in the dictionary `hmp`, `ans` is either 6m if none of the characters in the string `p` are keys in the dictionary `hmp`, or the sum of `m` for each character in the string `p` that is not a key in the dictionary `hmp`, or the sum of `m` for each character in the string `p` that is not a key in the dictionary `hmp` plus `m` minus the frequency of the character `i` in the string `s` plus `m` minus the frequency of the character `i` in the string `s`**.

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `m` minus the frequency of the character `i` in the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
