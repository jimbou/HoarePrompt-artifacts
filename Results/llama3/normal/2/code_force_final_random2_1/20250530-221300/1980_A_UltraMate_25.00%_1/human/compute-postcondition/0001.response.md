The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and stdin contains `t` test cases, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, to make it clear that the loop will execute, we can adjust the state of `t` to be at least 1 and `_` is now 0 (since `_` is the loop variable and it starts from 0).
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `t` test cases, `_` is 0**
