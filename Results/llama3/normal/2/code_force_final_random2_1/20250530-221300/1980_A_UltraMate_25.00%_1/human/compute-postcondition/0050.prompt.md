Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 1000, n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, s is a string equal to the third input, p is 'ABCDEF', hmp is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in s, stdin contains t-3 test cases, _ is 1, i is the last key in the dictionary hmp, ans is 6m if none of the characters in the string p are keys in the dictionary hmp, otherwise ans is the sum of m for each character in the string p that is not a key in the dictionary hmp.
Code of the loop:
for i in hmp:
    if hmp[i] < m:
        ans += m - hmp[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `s` is a string equal to the third input, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that must have at least 1 key-value pair, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 1, `i` is the first key in the dictionary `hmp`. The value of `ans` is either 6m if none of the characters in the string `p` are keys in the dictionary `hmp`, or the sum of `m` for each character in the string `p` that is not a key in the dictionary `hmp`. If the frequency of the character `i` in the string `s` is less than `m`, `ans` is updated by adding `m` minus the frequency of the character `i` in the string `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `s` is a string equal to the third input, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 1, `i` is the second key in the dictionary `hmp`, `ans` is either 6m if none of the characters in the string `p` are keys in the dictionary `hmp`, or the sum of `m` for each character in the string `p` that is not a key in the dictionary `hmp`, or the sum of `m` for each character in the string `p` that is not a key in the dictionary `hmp` plus `m` minus the frequency of the character `i` in the string `s` plus `m` minus the frequency of the character `i` in the string `s` if the frequency of the character `i` in the dictionary `hmp` is less than `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `s` is a string equal to the third input, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that must have at least 3 key-value pairs, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 1, `i` is the third key in the dictionary `hmp`, `ans` is either 6m if none of the characters in the string `p` are keys in the dictionary `hmp`, or the sum of `m` for each character in the string `p` that is not a key in the dictionary `hmp`, or the sum of `m` for each character in the string `p` that is not a key in the dictionary `hmp` plus `m` minus the frequency of the character `i` in the string `s` plus `m` minus the frequency of the character `i` in the string `s` if the frequency of the character `i` in the dictionary `hmp` is less than `m`, and if the frequency of the character `i` in the dictionary `hmp` is less than `m`, `ans` has been increased by `m` minus the frequency of the character `i` in the string `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
