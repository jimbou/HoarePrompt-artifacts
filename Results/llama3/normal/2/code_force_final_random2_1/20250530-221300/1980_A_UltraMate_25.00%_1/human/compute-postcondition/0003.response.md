To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `p`. The loop will execute if `p` is not empty.

State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, n is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string, ans is 0, p is 'ABCDEF' and is not empty, hmp is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in s, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0, i is the first character in p**
