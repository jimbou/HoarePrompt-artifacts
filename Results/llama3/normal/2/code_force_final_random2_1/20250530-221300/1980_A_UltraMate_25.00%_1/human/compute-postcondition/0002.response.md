Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, n is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string, ans is 0, p is 'ABCDEF', hmp is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in s, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0**

The code block reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, followed by a string `s`. It then initializes `ans` to 0 and sets `p` to the string 'ABCDEF'. The `Counter` function from the `collections` module is used to count the frequency of each character in `s` and store it in the dictionary `hmp`. Since `t` is the number of test cases and one test case has been processed, `t-1` test cases remain in the input. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0.
