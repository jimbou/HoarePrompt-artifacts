Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `s` is a string equal to the third input, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` that must have at least 3 key-value pairs, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 2, `i` is the third key in the dictionary `hmp`. If the frequency of 'F' in `s` is less than `m` and the frequency of the character represented by `i` is less than `m`, `ans` is either 6m + m - hmp['F'] - 2m + hmp[i] or a multiple of `m` between `m` and 6m + m - hmp['F'] - 2m + hmp[i]. If the frequency of 'F' in `s` is less than `m` but the frequency of the character represented by `i` is not less than `m`, `ans` is either 6m + m - hmp['F'] - m or a multiple of `m` between `m` and 6m + m - hmp['F'] - m. If the frequency of 'F' in `s` is not less than `m` and the frequency of the character represented by `i` is less than `m`, `ans` is either 6m - 2m + hmp[i] or a multiple of `m` between `m` and 6m - 2m + hmp[i]. If the frequency of 'F' in `s` is not less than `m` and the frequency of the character represented by `i` is not less than `m`, `ans` is either 6m - m or a multiple of `m` between `m` and 6m - m.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by subtracting the frequency of the character represented by `i` from `m` and adding the result to the previous value of `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for the value of `ans` have been updated accordingly, taking into account the new value of `ans`.
