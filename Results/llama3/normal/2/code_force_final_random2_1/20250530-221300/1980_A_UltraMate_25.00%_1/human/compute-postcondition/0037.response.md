Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `s` is a string equal to the third input, `p` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `hmp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 1, `i` is the second character in the string `p`, `ans` is increased by `m`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is increased by the value of `m`, which is the second input. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still between 2 and 1000, `n` is still the first input, `s` is still the third input, `p` is still a string with at least 3 characters, `hmp` is still a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s`, and `stdin` still contains `t-3` test cases. The value of `_` is still 1, and `i` is still the second character in the string `p`.
