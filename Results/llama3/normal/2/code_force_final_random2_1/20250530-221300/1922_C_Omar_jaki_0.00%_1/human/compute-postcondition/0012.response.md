Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of test cases, `a` is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 4 elements, `b` is a list containing two zeros plus the value of `b[-2]` plus `v` to the power of a boolean expression that is true if `v` is greater than `x` minus `w`, and `b[-1]` plus `v` to the power of a boolean expression that is true if `v` is greater than `z` minus `y`, `w` is the last element in the list, `x` is the second last element in the list, `y` is the third last element in the list, `z` is the fourth last element in the list, `v` is `y` minus `x`, `u` is returned, stdin contains no test cases, and the list `b` and the string 'B' are printed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `u` is returned, and the list `b` and the string 'B' are printed. The values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `w`, `x`, `y`, `z`, and `v` remain unchanged.
