State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of test cases, a is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 6 elements, b is a list containing 7 elements: two zeros, and five values calculated based on the differences between elements in a, w is the third element of a, x is the fourth element of a, y is the fifth element of a, z is the sixth element of a, v is the difference between the fifth and fourth elements of a, u, c, and d are not defined, the list b and the string 'B' were printed, if c is less than d, the difference between the elements at indices (d - 1) * 2 and (c - 1) * 2 in the list b is being printed, if c is not less than d, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element and the (2*d - 1)th element of the list b is being printed.**
