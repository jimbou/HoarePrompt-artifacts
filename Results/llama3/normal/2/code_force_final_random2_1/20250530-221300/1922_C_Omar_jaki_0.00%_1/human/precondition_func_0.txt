stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer, then a list of unique integers in ascending order, then an integer, and then a list of pairs of unique integers. The first integer is a positive integer, the list of integers is non-empty, the second integer is a positive integer, and the list of pairs of integers is non-empty.
