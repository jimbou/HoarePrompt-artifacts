Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of test cases minus 1 and `t` must be greater than zero, `a` is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 4 elements, `b` is a list containing 2n+2 elements: two zeros, and n pairs of calculated values, `w` is the nth element in the list, `x` is the (n+1)th element in the list, `y` is the (n+2)th element in the list, `z` is the (n+3)th element in the list, `v` is `y` minus `x`, `u` is the value returned by function `r()`, `c` and `d` are the values returned by function `r()` (but not used), the list `b` and the string 'B' were printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: the value of `t` remains the same, the list `a` remains the same, the list `b` remains the same, the values of `w`, `x`, `y`, `z`, and `v` remain the same, the value of `u` is updated to the value returned by function `r()`, the values returned by function `r()` for `c` and `d` are not used, and the list `b` and the string 'B' were printed.
