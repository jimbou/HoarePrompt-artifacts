Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the given code. It correctly calculates the minimum number of coins needed to travel between cities based on the given rules.

The program first calculates the cumulative sum of the distances between cities in both directions (forward and backward) and stores them in the list `b`. Then, for each query, it calculates the minimum number of coins needed to travel between the given cities by subtracting the corresponding cumulative sums.

The program handles all possible cases, including when the source city is less than the destination city and when the source city is greater than the destination city. It also handles the case when the source city is the first city and the destination city is the last city.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
