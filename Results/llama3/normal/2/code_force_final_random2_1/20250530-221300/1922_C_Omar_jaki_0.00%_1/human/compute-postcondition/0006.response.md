Output State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, a is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 4 elements, b is a list containing two zeros plus the value of b[-2] plus v to the power of a boolean expression that is true if v is greater than x minus w, and b[-1] plus v to the power of a boolean expression that is true if v is greater than z minus y, w is the second element in the list, x is the third element in the list, y is the fourth element in the list, z is the fifth element in the list, v is y minus x, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

The code snippet modifies the list `b` by appending two new elements. The first new element is the sum of the second last element of `b` (`b[-2]`) and `v` raised to the power of a boolean expression that is true if `v` is greater than `x - w`. The second new element is the sum of the last element of `b` (`b[-1]`) and `v` raised to the power of a boolean expression that is true if `v` is greater than `z - y`. The value of `v` is calculated as `y - x`, where `y` is the fourth element in the list and `x` is the third element in the list. The values of `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are not modified by the code. The variable `t` and the list `a` are not affected by the code. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by one.
