Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of test cases, `a` is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 4 elements, `b` is a list containing 2 * (len(a) - 2) + 2 elements: two zeros, and 2 * (len(a) - 3) values calculated based on the differences between elements in `a`, `w` is the (len(a) - 3)th element of `a`, `x` is the (len(a) - 2)th element of `a`, `y` is the (len(a) - 1)th element of `a`, `z` is the last element of `a`, `v` is the difference between the last two elements of `a`, `u` is the first element of the result of function `r()`, `c`, and `d` are not defined, the list `b` and the string 'B' were printed, if `c` is less than `d`, the difference between the elements at indices (d - 1) * 2 and (c - 1) * 2 in the list `b` is being printed, if `c` is not less than `d`, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element and the (2*d - 1)th element of the list `b` is being printed, and this is printed: the list `b` and the string 'B'.
Code of the loop:
while u:
    u -= 1
    c, d = r()
    if c < d:
        print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
    else:
        print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of test cases, a is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 4 elements, b is a list containing 2 * (len(a) - 2) + 2 elements: two zeros, and 2 * (len(a) - 3) values calculated based on the differences between elements in a, w is the (len(a) - 3)th element of a, x is the (len(a) - 2)th element of a, y is the (len(a) - 1)th element of a, z is the last element of a, v is the difference between the last two elements of a, u is falsy, c and d are defined and are the return values of the function r(), the list b and the string 'B' were printed, and this is printed: if c is less than d, the difference between the elements at indices (d - 1) * 2 and (c - 1) * 2 in the list b which is b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2], otherwise the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element and the (2*d - 1)th element of the list b.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of test cases, a is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 4 elements, b is a list containing 2 * (len(a) - 2) + 2 elements: two zeros, and 2 * (len(a) - 3) values calculated based on the differences between elements in a, w is the (len(a) - 3)th element of a, x is the (len(a) - 2)th element of a, y is the (len(a) - 1)th element of a, z is the last element of a, v is the difference between the last two elements of a, u is falsy, c and d are defined and are the return values of the function r(). If c is less than d, the difference between the (2 * (d - 1))th element of b and the (2 * (c - 1))th element of b is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the (2 * c - 1)th element of b and the (2 * d - 1)th element of b is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of test cases, a is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 4 elements, b is a list containing 2 * (len(a) - 2) + 2 elements: two zeros, and 2 * (len(a) - 3) values calculated based on the differences between elements in a, w is the (len(a) - 3)th element of a, x is the (len(a) - 2)th element of a, y is the (len(a) - 1)th element of a, z is the last element of a, v is the difference between the last two elements of a, u is falsy, c and d are defined and are the return values of the function r(). If c is less than d, the difference between the (2 * (d - 1))th element of b and the (2 * (c - 1))th element of b is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element of b and the (2*d - 1)th element of b is printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
