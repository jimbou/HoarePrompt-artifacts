Output State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, a is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 5 elements, b is a list containing two zeros plus the value of b[-2] plus v to the power of a boolean expression that is true if v is greater than x minus w, and b[-1] plus v to the power of a boolean expression that is true if v is greater than z minus y, w is the third element in the list, x is the fourth element in the list, y is the fifth element in the list, z is the sixth element in the list, v is y minus x, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `a` also remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The list `b` is modified by the code, with two new elements added to the end. The first new element is the sum of the second last element of `b` and `v` raised to the power of a boolean expression that is true if `v` is greater than `x` minus `w`. The second new element is the sum of the last element of `b` and `v` raised to the power of a boolean expression that is true if `v` is greater than `z` minus `y`. The values of `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `v` is calculated as `y` minus `x`. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by one.
