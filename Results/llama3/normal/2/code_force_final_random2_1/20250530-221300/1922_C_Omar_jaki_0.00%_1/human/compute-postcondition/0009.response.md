Output State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of test cases, a is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 4 elements, b is a list containing two zeros plus the value of b[-2] plus v to the power of a boolean expression that is true if v is greater than x minus w, and b[-1] plus v to the power of a boolean expression that is true if v is greater than z minus y, w is the last element in the list, x is the second last element in the list, y is the third last element in the list, z is the fourth last element in the list, v is y minus x, stdin contains no test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of t has decreased by the number of test cases, the list a remains the same but must have at least 4 elements, the list b has been updated according to the loop body, and the variables w, x, y, z, and v have been updated to the last four elements of the list a. The stdin contains no test cases.
