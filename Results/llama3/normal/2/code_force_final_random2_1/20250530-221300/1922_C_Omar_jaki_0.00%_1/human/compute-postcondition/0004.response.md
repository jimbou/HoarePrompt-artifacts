Output State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, a is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 4 elements, b is a list containing two zeros plus the value of b[-2] plus v to the power of a boolean expression that is true if v is greater than x minus w, and b[-1] plus v to the power of a boolean expression that is true if v is greater than z minus y, w is the first element in the list, x is the second element in the list, y is the third element in the list, z is the fourth element in the list, v is y minus x, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each remaining test case contains three inputs: a list of unique integers in ascending order, then an integer, and then a list of pairs of unique integers.**

The code modifies the list `b` by appending two new values to it. The first new value is the sum of the second last element of `b` and `v` raised to the power of a boolean expression that is true if `v` is greater than `x - w`. The second new value is the sum of the last element of `b` and `v` raised to the power of a boolean expression that is true if `v` is greater than `z - y`. The value of `v` is calculated as `y - x`. The values of `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged. The value of `t` also remains unchanged. The list `a` remains unchanged. The stdin contains one less test case.
