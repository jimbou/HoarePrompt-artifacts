#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer, then a list of unique integers in ascending order, then an integer, and then a list of pairs of unique integers. The first integer is a positive integer, the list of integers is non-empty, the second integer is a positive integer, and the list of pairs of integers is non-empty.
    r = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = r()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        r()
        
        a = -1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0
        
        b = [0, 0]
        
        for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
            v = y - x
            b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
        
        print(b, 'B')
        
        u, = r()
        
        while u:
            u -= 1
            c, d = r()
            if c < d:
                print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
            else:
                print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
        
    #State: Output State: t is 0, a is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 4 elements, b is a list containing 2 * (len(a) - 2) + 2 elements: two zeros, and 2 * (len(a) - 3) values calculated based on the differences between elements in a, w is the (len(a) - 3)th element of a, x is the (len(a) - 2)th element of a, y is the (len(a) - 1)th element of a, z is the last element of a, v is the difference between the last two elements of a, u is falsy, c and d are defined and are the return values of the function r(). If c is less than d, the difference between the (2 * (d - 1))th element of b and the (2 * (c - 1))th element of b is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element of b and the (2*d - 1)th element of b is printed.
    #
    #In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times. The loop will continue to execute until the variable u becomes falsy, at which point it will stop. The variables c and d will be defined and will be the return values of the function r(). If c is less than d, the difference between the (2 * (d - 1))th element of b and the (2 * (c - 1))th element of b will be printed. Otherwise, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element of b and the (2*d - 1)th element of b will be printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of four inputs: a positive integer, a list of unique integers in ascending order, another positive integer, and a list of pairs of unique integers. It then calculates a list of values based on the differences between elements in the list of integers and prints the differences between specific elements in this list for each pair of integers in the list of pairs. The function continues to read and process test cases until it has read all the input.
