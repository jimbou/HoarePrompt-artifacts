Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of test cases minus 1 and `t` must be greater than zero, `a` is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 4 elements, `b` is a list containing 2n+2 elements: two zeros, and n pairs of calculated values, `w` is the nth element in the list, `x` is the (n+1)th element in the list, `y` is the (n+2)th element in the list, `z` is the (n+3)th element in the list, `v` is `y` minus `x`, `u` is the value returned by function `r()`, `c` and `d` are the values returned by function `r()` (but not used), the list `b` and the string 'B' were printed.
Code of the loop:
while u:
    u -= 1
    c, d = r()
    if c < d:
        print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
    else:
        print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of test cases minus 2 and t must be greater than zero, a is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 4 elements, b is a list containing 2n+2 elements: two zeros, and n pairs of calculated values, w is the nth element in the list, x is the (n+1)th element in the list, y is the (n+2)th element in the list, z is the (n+3)th element in the list, v is y minus x, u is falsy, c and d are the values returned by function r(), the list b and the string 'B' were printed. If c is less than d, the difference between the elements at indices (d - 1) * 2 and (c - 1) * 2 in the list b is being printed. If c is not less than d, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element and the (2*d - 1)th element of the list b is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of test cases minus 2 and t must be greater than zero, a is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 4 elements, b is a list containing 2n+2 elements: two zeros, and n pairs of calculated values, w is the nth element in the list, x is the (n+1)th element in the list, y is the (n+2)th element in the list, z is the (n+3)th element in the list, v is y minus x, u is falsy, c and d are the values returned by function r(), the list b and the string 'B' were printed. If c is less than d, the difference between the elements at indices (d - 1) * 2 and (c - 1) * 2 in the list b is being printed. If c is not less than d, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element and the (2*d - 1)th element of the list b is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of test cases minus 3 and t must be greater than zero, a is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 4 elements, b is a list containing 2n+2 elements: two zeros, and n pairs of calculated values, w is the nth element in the list, x is the (n+1)th element in the list, y is the (n+2)th element in the list, z is the (n+3)th element in the list, v is y minus x, u is falsy, c and d are the values returned by function r(), the list b and the string 'B' were printed. If c is less than d, the difference between the elements at indices (d - 1) * 2 and (c - 1) * 2 in the list b is being printed. If c is not less than d, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element and the (2*d - 1)th element of the list b is being printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
