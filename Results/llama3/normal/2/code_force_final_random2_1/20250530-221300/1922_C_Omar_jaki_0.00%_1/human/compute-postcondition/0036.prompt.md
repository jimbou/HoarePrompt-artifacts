Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of test cases, `a` is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 4 elements, `b` is a list containing two zeros plus the value of `b[-2]` plus `v` to the power of a boolean expression that is true if `v` is greater than `x` minus `w`, and `b[-1]` plus `v` to the power of a boolean expression that is true if `v` is greater than `z` minus `y`, `w` is the last element in the list, `x` is the second last element in the list, `y` is the third last element in the list, `z` is the fourth last element in the list, `v` is `y` minus `x`, `u` is returned, stdin contains no test cases, and the list `b` and the string 'B' are printed.
Code of the loop:
while u:
    u -= 1
    c, d = r()
    if c < d:
        print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
    else:
        print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of test cases, a is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 4 elements, b is a list containing two zeros plus the value of b[-2] plus v to the power of a boolean expression that is true if v is greater than x minus w, and b[-1] plus v to the power of a boolean expression that is true if v is greater than z minus y, w is the last element in the list, x is the second last element in the list, y is the third last element in the list, z is the fourth last element in the list, v is y minus x, u is a non-zero, non-empty value minus 1, c and d are the values returned by function r(), and stdin contains no test cases. If c is less than d, the difference between the element at index (d - 1) * 2 and the element at index (c - 1) * 2 in the list b is printed. If c is larger than or equal to d, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element of the list b and the (2*d - 1)th element of the list b is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of test cases, a is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 4 elements, b is a list containing two zeros plus the value of b[-2] plus v to the power of a boolean expression that is true if v is greater than x minus w, and b[-1] plus v to the power of a boolean expression that is true if v is greater than z minus y, w is the last element in the list, x is the second last element in the list, y is the third last element in the list, z is the fourth last element in the list, v is y minus x, u is a non-zero, non-empty value minus 2 and u currently must be greater than -1, c and d are the values returned by function r(). If c is less than d, the difference between the value at index (d - 1) * 2 and the value at index (c - 1) * 2 in the list b is being printed. Otherwise, the difference between the elements of list b at indices (2*c - 1) and (2*d - 1) is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of test cases, a is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 4 elements, b is a list containing two zeros plus the value of b[-2] plus v to the power of a boolean expression that is true if v is greater than x minus w, and b[-1] plus v to the power of a boolean expression that is true if v is greater than z minus y, w is the last element in the list, x is the second last element in the list, y is the third last element in the list, z is the fourth last element in the list, v is y minus x, u is a non-zero, non-empty value minus 3 and u currently must be greater than -1, c and d are the values returned by function r(). If c is less than d, the difference between the value at index (d - 1) * 2 and the value at index (c - 1) * 2 in the list b is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the elements of list b at indices (2*c - 1) and (2*d - 1) is printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
