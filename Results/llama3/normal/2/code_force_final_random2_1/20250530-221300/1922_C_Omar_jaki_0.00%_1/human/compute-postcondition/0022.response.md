The only variable in the loop head is variable u, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable u.  If u is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, u is a non-zero, non-empty value minus 1, So for the loop to be executed one more time the non-zero, non-empty value must have been equal to or greater than 2 and u currently must be greater than 0.
State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of test cases, a is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 4 elements, b is a list containing two zeros plus the value of b[-2] plus v to the power of a boolean expression that is true if v is greater than x minus w, and b[-1] plus v to the power of a boolean expression that is true if v is greater than z minus y, w is the last element in the list, x is the second last element in the list, y is the third last element in the list, z is the fourth last element in the list, v is y minus x, u is a non-zero, non-empty value minus 1 and u currently must be greater than 0, c and d are the values returned by function r(), and stdin contains no test cases. If c is less than d, the difference between the element at index (d - 1) * 2 and the element at index (c - 1) * 2 in the list b is printed. If c is larger than or equal to d, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element of the list b and the (2*d - 1)th element of the list b is printed.**
