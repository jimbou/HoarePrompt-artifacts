Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] (where b is the list containing two zeros plus the value of b[-2] plus v to the power of a boolean expression that is true if v is greater than x minus w, and b[-1] plus v to the power of a boolean expression that is true if v is greater than z minus y, d and c are the values returned by function r(), and c is less than d)**
