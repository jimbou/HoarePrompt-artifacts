Postcondition: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of test cases, a is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 4 elements, b is a list containing 2 * (len(a) - 2) + 2 elements: two zeros, and 2 * (len(a) - 3) values calculated based on the differences between elements in a, w is the (len(a) - 3)th element of a, x is the (len(a) - 2)th element of a, y is the (len(a) - 1)th element of a, z is the last element of a, v is the difference between the last two elements of a, u is falsy, c and d are defined and are the return values of the function r(), the list b and the string 'B' were printed, and this is printed: if c is less than d, the difference between the elements at indices (d - 1) * 2 and (c - 1) * 2 in the list b which is b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2], otherwise the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element and the (2*d - 1)th element of the list b.**
