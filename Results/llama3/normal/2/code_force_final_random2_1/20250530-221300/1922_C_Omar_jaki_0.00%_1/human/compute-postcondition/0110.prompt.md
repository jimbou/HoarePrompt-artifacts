Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each remaining test case contains three inputs: a list of unique integers in ascending order, then an integer, and then a list of pairs of unique integers. t is a positive integer.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    r()
    a = -1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0
    b = [0, 0]
    for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
        v = y - x
        b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
    print(b, 'B')
    u, = r()
    while u:
        u -= 1
        c, d = r()
        if c < d:
            print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
        else:
            print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of test cases, a is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 4 elements, b is a list containing two zeros plus the value of b[-2] plus v to the power of a boolean expression that is true if v is greater than x minus w, and b[-1] plus v to the power of a boolean expression that is true if v is greater than z minus y, w is the last element in the list, x is the second last element in the list, y is the third last element in the list, z is the fourth last element in the list, v is y minus x, u is 0, c and d are the values returned by function r(). If c is less than d, the difference between the value at index (d - 1) * 2 and the value at index (c - 1) * 2 in the list b is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the elements of list b at indices (2*c - 1) and (2*d - 1) is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of test cases and t must be greater than zero, a is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 4 elements, b is a list containing 2n+2 elements: two zeros, and n pairs of calculated values, w is the nth element in the list, x is the (n+1)th element in the list, y is the (n+2)th element in the list, z is the (n+3)th element in the list, v is y minus x, u is falsy, c and d are the values returned by function r(), the list b and the string 'B' were printed. If c is less than d, the difference between the elements at indices (d - 1) * 2 and (c - 1) * 2 in the list b is being printed. If c is not less than d, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element and the (2*d - 1)th element of the list b is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Output State: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of test cases, a is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 4 elements, b is a list containing 2 * (len(a) - 2) + 2 elements: two zeros, and 2 * (len(a) - 3) values calculated based on the differences between elements in a, w is the (len(a) - 3)th element of a, x is the (len(a) - 2)th element of a, y is the (len(a) - 1)th element of a, z is the last element of a, v is the difference between the last two elements of a, u is falsy, c and d are defined and are the return values of the function r(). If c is less than d, the difference between the (2 * (d - 1))th element of b and the (2 * (c - 1))th element of b is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element of b and the (2*d - 1)th element of b is printed.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times. The loop will continue to execute until the variable u becomes falsy, at which point it will stop. The variables c and d will be defined and will be the return values of the function r(). If c is less than d, the difference between the (2 * (d - 1))th element of b and the (2 * (c - 1))th element of b will be printed. Otherwise, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element of b and the (2*d - 1)th element of b will be printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
