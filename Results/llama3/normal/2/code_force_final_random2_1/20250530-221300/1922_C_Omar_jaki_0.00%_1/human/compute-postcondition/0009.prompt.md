Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, a is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended, b is a list containing two zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each remaining test case contains three inputs: a list of unique integers in ascending order, then an integer, and then a list of pairs of unique integers.
Code of the loop:
for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    v = y - x
    b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, a is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 4 elements, b is a list containing two zeros plus the value of b[-2] plus v to the power of a boolean expression that is true if v is greater than x minus w, and b[-1] plus v to the power of a boolean expression that is true if v is greater than z minus y, w is the first element in the list, x is the second element in the list, y is the third element in the list, z is the fourth element in the list, v is y minus x, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each remaining test case contains three inputs: a list of unique integers in ascending order, then an integer, and then a list of pairs of unique integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, a is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 4 elements, b is a list containing two zeros plus the value of b[-2] plus v to the power of a boolean expression that is true if v is greater than x minus w, and b[-1] plus v to the power of a boolean expression that is true if v is greater than z minus y, w is the second element in the list, x is the third element in the list, y is the fourth element in the list, z is the fifth element in the list, v is y minus x, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, a is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 5 elements, b is a list containing two zeros plus the value of b[-2] plus v to the power of a boolean expression that is true if v is greater than x minus w, and b[-1] plus v to the power of a boolean expression that is true if v is greater than z minus y, w is the third element in the list, x is the fourth element in the list, y is the fifth element in the list, z is the sixth element in the list, v is y minus x, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
