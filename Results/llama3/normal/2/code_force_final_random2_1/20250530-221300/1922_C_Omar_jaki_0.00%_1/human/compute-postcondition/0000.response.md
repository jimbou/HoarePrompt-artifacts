Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each remaining test case contains three inputs: a list of unique integers in ascending order, then an integer, and then a list of pairs of unique integers. t is a positive integer.**

The code defines a lambda function `r` that reads a line from stdin, splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters, and converts each string to an integer. The function `r` is then immediately called to read the first test case, which contains a single positive integer `t`. The value of `t` is assigned to the variable `t`. The remaining test cases in stdin are not affected by this code snippet.
