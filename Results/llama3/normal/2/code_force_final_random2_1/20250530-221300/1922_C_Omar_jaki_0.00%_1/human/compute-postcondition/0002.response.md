Output State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, a is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended, b is a list containing two zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each remaining test case contains three inputs: a list of unique integers in ascending order, then an integer, and then a list of pairs of unique integers.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, `a` has been modified to include -1000000000.0 at the beginning and 2000000000.0 at the end, and `b` has been initialized as a list containing two zeros. The state of stdin remains the same, with multiple test cases minus one test case, each containing three inputs: a list of unique integers in ascending order, then an integer, and then a list of pairs of unique integers.
