The code prints the list `b` which contains 2n+2 elements: two zeros, and n pairs of calculated values, followed by the string 'B'. Since the exact values of the calculated pairs in the list `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in the list `b`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the list `b` and the string 'B'.

Output: **[0, 0, (pair1), (pair2), ..., (pairn)], 'B' (where (pair1), (pair2), ..., (pairn) are the calculated pairs in the list b)**
