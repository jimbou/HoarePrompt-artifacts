Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of four inputs: a positive integer, a list of unique integers in ascending order, another positive integer, and a list of pairs of unique integers. It then calculates a list of values based on the differences between elements in the list of integers and prints the differences between specific elements in this list for each pair of integers in the list of pairs. The function continues to read and process test cases until it has read all the input.**
