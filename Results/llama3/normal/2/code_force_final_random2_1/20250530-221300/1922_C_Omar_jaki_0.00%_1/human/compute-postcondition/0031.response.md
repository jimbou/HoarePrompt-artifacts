The code prints the difference between the value at index (d - 1) * 2 and the value at index (c - 1) * 2 in the list b. Since c is less than d, the difference between the value at index (d - 1) * 2 and the value at index (c - 1) * 2 in the list b is being printed.
Output: **the difference between the value at index (d - 1) * 2 and the value at index (c - 1) * 2 in the list b (where c and d are the values returned by function r())**
