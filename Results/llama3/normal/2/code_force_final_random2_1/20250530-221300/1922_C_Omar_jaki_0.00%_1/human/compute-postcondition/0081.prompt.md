Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of test cases, a is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 4 elements, b is a list containing 2 elements: two zeros, w, x, y, z, v, u, c, and d are not defined, the list b and the string 'B' were printed. If c is less than d, the difference between the elements at indices (d - 1) * 2 and (c - 1) * 2 in the list b is being printed. If c is not less than d, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element and the (2*d - 1)th element of the list b is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    v = y - x
    b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of test cases, a is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 4 elements, b is a list containing 4 elements: two zeros, and two values calculated based on the differences between elements in a, w is the first element of a, x is the second element of a, y is the third element of a, z is the fourth element of a, v is the difference between the third and second elements of a, u, c, and d are not defined, the list b and the string 'B' were printed. If c is less than d, the difference between the elements at indices (d - 1) * 2 and (c - 1) * 2 in the list b is being printed. If c is not less than d, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element and the (2*d - 1)th element of the list b is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of test cases, a is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 5 elements, b is a list containing 6 elements: two zeros, and four values calculated based on the differences between elements in a, w is the second element of a, x is the third element of a, y is the fourth element of a, z is the fifth element of a, v is the difference between the fourth and third elements of a, u, c, and d are not defined, the list b and the string 'B' were printed, if c is less than d, the difference between the elements at indices (d - 1) * 2 and (c - 1) * 2 in the list b is being printed, if c is not less than d, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element and the (2*d - 1)th element of the list b is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of test cases, a is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 6 elements, b is a list containing 9 elements: two zeros, and seven values calculated based on the differences between elements in a, w is the third element of a, x is the fourth element of a, y is the fifth element of a, z is the sixth element of a, v is the difference between the fifth and fourth elements of a, u, c, and d are not defined, the list b and the string 'B' were printed, if c is less than d, the difference between the elements at indices (d - 1) * 2 and (c - 1) * 2 in the list b is being printed, if c is not less than d, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element and the (2*d - 1)th element of the list b is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
