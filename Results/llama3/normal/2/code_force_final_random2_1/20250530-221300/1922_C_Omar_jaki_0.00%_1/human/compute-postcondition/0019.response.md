Output: **b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1] (where c and d are the values returned by function r(), c is larger than or equal to d, and b is a list containing two zeros plus the value of b[-2] plus v to the power of a boolean expression that is true if v is greater than x minus w, and b[-1] plus v to the power of a boolean expression that is true if v is greater than z minus y)**
