The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is not zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of test cases. For the loop to be executed one more time, t must be greater than zero, which means the number of test cases must be less than the original value of t. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of test cases and t must be greater than zero, a is a list of unique integers in ascending order with -1000000000.0 prepended and 2000000000.0 appended that must have at least 4 elements, b is a list containing two zeros plus the value of b[-2] plus v to the power of a boolean expression that is true if v is greater than x minus w, and b[-1] plus v to the power of a boolean expression that is true if v is greater than z minus y, w is the last element in the list, x is the second last element in the list, y is the third last element in the list, z is the fourth last element in the list, v is y minus x, u is 0, c and d are the values returned by function r().**
