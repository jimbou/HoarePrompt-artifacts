Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem involving cities located on a number line and the minimum cost to travel between them. The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of cities, the coordinates of the cities, the number of queries, and the queries themselves.

The program calculates the minimum cost to travel between each pair of cities by maintaining two lists, `b`, which store the cumulative costs of traveling from the first city to each city and from each city to the last city, respectively.

The program then iterates over the queries, and for each query, it calculates the minimum cost to travel between the two cities by subtracting the corresponding elements from the `b` lists.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
