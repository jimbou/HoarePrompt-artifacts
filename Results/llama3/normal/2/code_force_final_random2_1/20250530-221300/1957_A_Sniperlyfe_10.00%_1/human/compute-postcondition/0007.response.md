Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 sticks, `freq` is a dictionary with the first stick in the list as a key and its frequency is 1, and the second stick in the list as a key and its frequency is 2, and the third stick in the list as a key and its frequency is increased by 1, `n` is the last stick in the list**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `arr` has been fully processed, and the dictionary `freq` contains the frequency of each stick length in the list. The variable `n` now holds the value of the last stick in the list.
