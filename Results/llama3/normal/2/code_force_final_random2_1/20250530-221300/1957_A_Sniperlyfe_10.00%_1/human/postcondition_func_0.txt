This function calculates the total number of bundles of four sticks that can be formed from a given list of sticks. It takes a list of integers representing stick lengths as input, counts the frequency of each stick length, and returns the sum of the integer divisions of these frequencies by 4. The function effectively groups the sticks into bundles of four, ignoring any remaining sticks that do not form a complete bundle.
