Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 sticks, `freq` is a dictionary with the first stick in the list as a key and its frequency is 1, and the second stick in the list as a key and its frequency is 2, `n` is the second stick in the list**

In this output state, the frequency of the second stick in the list (`n`) has been incremented by 1 in the `freq` dictionary. The other variables remain unchanged. The `arr` list still contains at least 2 sticks, and the `freq` dictionary still has the first stick as a key with a frequency of 1. The value of `n` is still the second stick in the list.
