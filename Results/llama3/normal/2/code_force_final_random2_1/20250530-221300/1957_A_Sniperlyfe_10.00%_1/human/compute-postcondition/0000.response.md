Output State: **arr is a list of integers, where each integer represents the length of a stick, and all integers are between 1 and 100 (inclusive), freq is an empty dictionary.**

In this output state, the variable `arr` remains unchanged, still representing a list of integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), each representing the length of a stick. The new variable `freq` is introduced as an empty dictionary, ready to potentially store frequency information about the stick lengths in `arr`.
