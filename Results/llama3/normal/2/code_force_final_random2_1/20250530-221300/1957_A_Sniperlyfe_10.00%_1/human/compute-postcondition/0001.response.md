According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. If the list has at least 1 stick the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, freq is an empty dictionary. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 stick and the n is the first stick in the list.
State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 stick, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `n` is the first stick in the list**
