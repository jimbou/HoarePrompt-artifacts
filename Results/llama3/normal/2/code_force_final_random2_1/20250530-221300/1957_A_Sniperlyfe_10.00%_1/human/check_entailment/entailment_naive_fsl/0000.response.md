Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input is [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2], the program will output 0, but the correct output should be 2, because we can form two squares with side length 1 and 2 respectively.

The issue with the program is that it only counts the number of sticks that can form a square (i.e., the number of sticks that have a frequency of at least 4), but it does not consider the case where we can form multiple polygons with different side lengths.

To fix this issue, the program should count the number of sticks that can form a polygon with any side length, not just a square. This can be done by counting the number of sticks that have a frequency of at least 3 (for a triangle), 4 (for a square), 5 (for a pentagon), and so on.

Here is an example of how the corrected program could look like:
```
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    count = 0
    for v in freq.values():
        count += v // 3
    return count
```
This program counts the number of sticks that can form a polygon with any side length by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 3 (for a triangle), and summing up the results.
