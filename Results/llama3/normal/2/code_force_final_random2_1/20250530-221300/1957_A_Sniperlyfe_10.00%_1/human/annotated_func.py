#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, where each integer represents the length of a stick, and all integers are between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 sticks, `freq` is a dictionary with the first stick in the list as a key and its frequency is 1, and the second stick in the list as a key and its frequency is 2, and the third stick in the list as a key and its frequency is increased by 1, `n` is the last stick in the list
    return sum(v // 4 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each stick by 4, where the frequency of the first stick is 1, the frequency of the second stick is 2, and the frequency of the third stick is increased by 1, and the last stick is not included in the calculation.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the total number of bundles of four sticks that can be formed from a given list of sticks. It takes a list of integers representing stick lengths as input, counts the frequency of each stick length, and returns the sum of the integer divisions of these frequencies by 4. The function effectively groups the sticks into bundles of four, ignoring any remaining sticks that do not form a complete bundle.
