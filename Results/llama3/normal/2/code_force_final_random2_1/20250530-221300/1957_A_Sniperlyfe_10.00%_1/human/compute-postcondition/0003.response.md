The only objects in the loop head are variables  `n` and list  `arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`.  If the list has at least 2 sticks the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 stick, `freq` is a dictionary with the first stick in the list as a key and its frequency is 1, `n` is the first stick in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 sticks and the `n` is the second stick in the list.
State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 sticks, `freq` is a dictionary with the first stick in the list as a key and its frequency is 1, `n` is the second stick in the list**
