Output State: **n is an integer between 2 * 10^5 and 2 (inclusive), k is an even integer between 2 and n (inclusive), permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is curr_v, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is curr_v + 1, multiples_of_k_plus_i is len(permutation), stdin is empty, i is 0, k is at least 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the loop has finished executing, and the values of the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` has reached the length of the `permutation` list, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements of the list. The value of `curr_v` has been incremented by 1 in each iteration, and the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` has been set to `curr_v` in each iteration. The values of `idx`, `idx_v`, `stdin`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
