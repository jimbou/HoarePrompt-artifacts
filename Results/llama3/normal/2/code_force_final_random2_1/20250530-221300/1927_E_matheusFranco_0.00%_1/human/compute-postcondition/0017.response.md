Output State: **n is an integer between 2 * 10^5 and 2 (inclusive), k is an even integer between 2 and n (inclusive), permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is curr_v + 1, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is curr_v + 1, multiples_of_k_plus_i is less than len(permutation) and is k greater than its original value, stdin is empty, i is 1**

The code block modifies the permutation list by assigning the current value of curr_v to the index multiples_of_k_plus_i. Then, it increments curr_v by 1. Finally, it increments multiples_of_k_plus_i by k, which is an even integer between 2 and n (inclusive). The value of n, k, idx, idx_v, and i remain unchanged. The stdin remains empty as no input operation is performed.
