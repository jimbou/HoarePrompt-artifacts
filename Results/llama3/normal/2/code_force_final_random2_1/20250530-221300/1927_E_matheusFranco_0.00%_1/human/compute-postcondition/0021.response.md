To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition: `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2.
- `permutation` is a list of `n` values.

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)` must be true. Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2, `len(permutation)` (which is `n`) must be greater than 2.

The initial state of `n` is between 2 * 10^5 and 2 (inclusive), which means `n` could be 2, making the loop condition false. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be adjusted to be greater than 2.

No other states need to be adjusted since the loop condition only depends on `multiples_of_k_plus_i` and `len(permutation)` (which is `n`).

State: **permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is curr_v, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is curr_v + n/k, multiples_of_k_plus_i is 2, stdin is empty, i is 2, k is at least 3, n is an integer greater than 2**
