Output State: **`result` is a string of space-separated values of permutation, permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is curr_v + n/k * (i + 1) + ((len(permutation) - 1) // k) * i, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is curr_v + n/k * (i + 1) + ((len(permutation) - 1) // k) * i, multiples_of_k_plus_i is i + ((len(permutation) - 1) // k) * k, stdin is empty, i is k - 1, k is at least k, n is an integer between 2 * 10^5 and 2 (inclusive).**

In natural language, the output state is that a new variable `result` is created, which is a string containing the space-separated values of the `permutation` list. The other variables remain unchanged, and their values are still valid. The `permutation` list still has the same structure and values, and the other variables (`idx`, `idx_v`, `curr_v`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i`, `stdin`, `i`, `k`, and `n`) retain their original values.
