The variable in the loop head is multiples_of_k_plus_i and len(permutation), so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable multiples_of_k_plus_i and len(permutation). If multiples_of_k_plus_i is less than len(permutation), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, multiples_of_k_plus_i is multiples_of_k_plus_i + k, len(permutation) is n. multiples_of_k_plus_i + k being less than n does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to multiples_of_k_plus_i + k is less than n. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is an integer between 2 * 10^5 and 2 (inclusive), k is an even integer between 2 and n (inclusive), permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is curr_v + 1, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is curr_v + 1, multiples_of_k_plus_i is multiples_of_k_plus_i + k and multiples_of_k_plus_i + k is less than n, stdin is empty, i is 1**
