The function generates a permutation of n values based on the input parameters n and k, where k is even and 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5. It constructs the permutation by iterating over multiples of k plus i, where i ranges from 0 to k-1, and assigns a value to each position in the permutation based on the formula curr_v + n/k * (i + 1) + ((len(permutation) - 1) // k) * i. The function then prints the permutation as a space-separated string of values.
