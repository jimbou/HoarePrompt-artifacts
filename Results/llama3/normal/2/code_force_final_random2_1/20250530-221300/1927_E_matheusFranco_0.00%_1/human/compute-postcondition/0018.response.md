Output State: **permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is curr_v, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is curr_v + n/k, multiples_of_k_plus_i is n, stdin is empty, i is 1, k is at least 2, n is an integer between 2 * 10^5 and 2 (inclusive).**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the permutation list has been fully populated with values, and the loop variables have reached their final values. The permutation list now contains the values from the initial curr_v to curr_v + n/k, and the multiples_of_k_plus_i index has reached the end of the list (n). The other variables, such as idx, idx_v, stdin, and i, remain unchanged.
