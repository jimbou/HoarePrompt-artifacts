Output State: **permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is curr_v + 1, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is curr_v + n/k + 1, multiples_of_k_plus_i is 2 + k, stdin is empty, i is 2, k is at least 3, n is an integer greater than 2**

In this output state, the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` has been updated to `curr_v + 1` because the first line of the code assigns `curr_v` to this position in the list, and the second line increments `curr_v` by 1. The value of `curr_v` itself has been incremented by 1, and its original value was `curr_v + n/k`, so its new value is `curr_v + n/k + 1`. The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` has been incremented by `k`, so its new value is `2 + k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
