Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to generate a k-level permutation of length n. The function `func_1` generates the permutation by iterating over multiples of k plus i, where i ranges from 0 to k-1, and assigns a value to each position in the permutation based on the formula curr_v + n/k * (i + 1) + ((len(permutation) - 1) // k) * i. This logic ensures that the permutation is k-level, meaning that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of continuous segments of length k is at most 1.

The function `func_2` reads an integer from standard input and executes `func_1` a number of times equal to the input integer. This allows the program to handle multiple test cases.

The program correctly handles the constraints given in the problem, including the fact that k is even and 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5.

Correctness: **True**
