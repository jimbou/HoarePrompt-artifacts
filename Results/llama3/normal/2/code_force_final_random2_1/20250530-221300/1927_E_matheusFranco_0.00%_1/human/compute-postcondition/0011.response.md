Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 * 10^5 and 2 (inclusive), `k` is an even integer between 2 and `n` (inclusive), `permutation` is a list of `n` values where `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v`, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `curr_v` + 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1, `k` is at least 2**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `multiples_of_k_plus_i`. Since `i` is 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
