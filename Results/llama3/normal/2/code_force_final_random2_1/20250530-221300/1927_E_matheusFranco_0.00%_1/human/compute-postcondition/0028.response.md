Output State: **permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is curr_v + n/k + (len(permutation) - 1) // k, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is curr_v + n/k + (len(permutation) - 1) // k, multiples_of_k_plus_i is 2 + ((len(permutation) - 1) // k) * k, stdin is empty, i is 2, k is at least 3, n is an integer between 2 * 10^5 and 2 (inclusive).**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of n values where the value at index multiples_of_k_plus_i is curr_v + n/k + (len(permutation) - 1) // k. The other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remain unchanged.
