Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains no input.**

The first line calls the function `func_1()`, but since the function's definition is not provided, we cannot determine its effect on the program state. The second line decrements the value of `t` by 1. Since `t` was initially an integer greater than 0, after the decrement, it will be an integer greater than or equal to 0. The state of stdin remains unchanged, as there is no input to process.
