Output: **`result` is a string of space-separated values of permutation, permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is curr_v + n/k * (i + 1) + ((len(permutation) - 1) // k) * i, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is curr_v + n/k * (i + 1) + ((len(permutation) - 1) // k) * i, multiples_of_k_plus_i is i + ((len(permutation) - 1) // k) * k, stdin is empty, i is k - 1, k is at least k, n is an integer between 2 * 10^5 and 2 (inclusive), and the string of space-separated values of permutation is being printed**
