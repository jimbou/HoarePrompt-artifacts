The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `k` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 2.
State: **permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is curr_v, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is curr_v + n/k, multiples_of_k_plus_i is n, stdin is empty, i is 2, k is at least 3, n is an integer between 2 * 10^5 and 2 (inclusive).**
