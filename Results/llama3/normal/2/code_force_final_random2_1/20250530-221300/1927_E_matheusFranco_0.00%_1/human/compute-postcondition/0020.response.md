Output State: **permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is curr_v, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is curr_v + n/k, multiples_of_k_plus_i is 2, stdin is empty, i is 2, k is at least 3, n is an integer between 2 * 10^5 and 2 (inclusive).**

In this output state, the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` has been updated to 2, which is the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `permutation` still has `n` values, and the relationship between `permutation`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i`, `curr_v`, `idx`, `idx_v`, `i`, `k`, and `n` remains the same as in the initial state.
