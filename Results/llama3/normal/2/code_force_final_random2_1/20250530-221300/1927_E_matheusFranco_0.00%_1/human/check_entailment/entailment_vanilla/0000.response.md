Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even. A permutation is k-level if the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of continuous segments of length k is at most 1.

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes input for a single test case and constructs a k-level permutation, while `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

Let's analyze `func_1`:

1. It reads the input for a single test case, splitting it into two integers `n` and `k`.
2. It initializes an array `permutation` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
3. It uses two indices, `idx` and `idx_v`, to keep track of the current position in the permutation and the current value to be assigned, respectively.
4. It iterates over the range `k`, and for each iteration, it calculates the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` as `i`.
5. It then enters a while loop that continues until `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of the permutation. Inside the loop, it assigns the current value `curr_v` to the permutation at index `multiples_of_k_plus_i`, increments `curr_v` by 1, and increments `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k`.
6. After the loop, it constructs a string `result` by joining the elements of the permutation array with spaces and prints it.

Now, let's analyze the correctness of the program:

* The program correctly reads the input for each test case and constructs a permutation of length `n`.
* The permutation construction logic is correct. By assigning values in a cyclic manner, starting from `1` and incrementing by `1` for each assignment, the program ensures that the permutation is indeed a k-level permutation.
* The program correctly handles the case where `k` is even, as required by the problem statement.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program. In the while loop, the condition `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)` is not sufficient to ensure that the loop terminates correctly. This is because `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is incremented by `k` in each iteration, and `k` can be larger than the remaining length of the permutation. As a result, the loop may access indices outside the bounds of the permutation array, leading to incorrect results or runtime errors.

To fix this issue, the condition in the while loop should be changed to `multiples_of_k_plus_i < n`, where `n` is the length of the permutation.

Correctness: **False**
