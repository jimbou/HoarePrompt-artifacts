To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `k` is at least 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `k` remains the same, but since `k` is at least 1, it must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 * 10^5 and 2 (inclusive), `k` is an even integer between 2 and `n` (inclusive), `permutation` is a list of `n` values where `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v`, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `curr_v` + 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `len(permutation)`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1, `k` is at least 2**
