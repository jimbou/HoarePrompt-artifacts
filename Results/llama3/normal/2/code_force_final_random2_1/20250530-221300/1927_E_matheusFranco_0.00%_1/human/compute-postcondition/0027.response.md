Output State: permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is curr_v + n/k + floor((len(permutation) - 2) / k) + 1, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is curr_v + n/k + floor((len(permutation) - 2) / k) + 1, multiples_of_k_plus_i is 2 + floor((len(permutation) - 2) / k) * k, stdin is empty, i is 2, k is at least 3, n is an integer between 2 * 10^5 and 2 (inclusive).

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of n values where the value at index multiples_of_k_plus_i is curr_v + n/k + floor((len(permutation) - 2) / k) + 1. The idx and idx_v variables remain unchanged at 0 and 1, respectively. The curr_v variable is incremented by n/k + floor((len(permutation) - 2) / k) + 1. The multiples_of_k_plus_i variable is incremented by floor((len(permutation) - 2) / k) * k. The stdin variable remains empty, and the i and k variables remain unchanged at 2 and at least 3, respectively. The n variable remains an integer between 2 * 10^5 and 2 (inclusive).
