Output State: **n is an integer between 2 * 10^5 and 2 (inclusive), k is an even integer between 2 and n (inclusive), permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is curr_v + 1, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is curr_v + 1, multiples_of_k_plus_i is multiples_of_k_plus_i + k, stdin is empty, i is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` has been updated to `curr_v + 1`, `curr_v` has been incremented by 1, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` has been incremented by `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
