The `print(result)` statement will print the string `result` which contains space-separated values of the permutation.

The permutation is a list of `n` values, where each value is calculated using the formula `curr_v + n/k * (i + 1) + ((len(permutation) - 1) // k) * i`. This formula is used to calculate the value at index `multiples_of_k_plus_i`, which is `i + ((len(permutation) - 1) // k) * k`.

Since `i` is `k - 1`, the last value in the permutation is calculated using the formula `curr_v + n/k * k + ((len(permutation) - 1) // k) * (k - 1)`.

The `result` string is a space-separated representation of this permutation.

Output: **space-separated values of the permutation (where each value is calculated using the formula curr_v + n/k * (i + 1) + ((len(permutation) - 1) // k) * i, and i is k - 1)**
