Output State: **n is an integer between 2 * 10^5 and 2 (inclusive), k is an even integer between 2 and n (inclusive), permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is curr_v, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is curr_v + 1, multiples_of_k_plus_i is multiples_of_k_plus_i + k and multiples_of_k_plus_i + k is less than n, stdin is empty, i is 1**

The code block modifies the values of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]`, `curr_v`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i`. The first line assigns the value of `curr_v` to `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]`. The second line increments `curr_v` by 1. The third line increments `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
