Output State: **permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is curr_v + n/k * (i + 1) + ((len(permutation) - 1) // k) * i, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is curr_v + n/k * (i + 1) + ((len(permutation) - 1) // k) * i, multiples_of_k_plus_i is i + ((len(permutation) - 1) // k) * k, stdin is empty, i is k - 1, k is at least k, n is an integer between 2 * 10^5 and 2 (inclusive).**

This output state indicates that after the loop executes all its iterations, the permutation list will have values assigned to it based on the multiples of k plus the current index i. The curr_v variable will have been incremented by the total number of multiples of k plus the number of times the loop has executed. The multiples_of_k_plus_i variable will have reached the end of the permutation list, and the i variable will have reached the value of k-1, indicating that the loop has executed k times. The other variables, idx, idx_v, and stdin, remain unchanged.
