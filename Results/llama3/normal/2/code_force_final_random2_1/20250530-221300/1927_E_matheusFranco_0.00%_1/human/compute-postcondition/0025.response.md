To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `multiples_of_k_plus_i` and `permutation`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`. At the end of the last iteration, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2 + 2k, and `permutation` is a list of at least 6 values.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` and `permutation` such that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is still less than the length of `permutation`.

Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2 + 2k, and k is at least 3, we can deduce that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is at least 8. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute again, `permutation` must have at least 9 values.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **permutation is a list of at least 9 values, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is curr_v + n/k + 2, multiples_of_k_plus_i is 2 + 2k, stdin is empty, i is 2, k is at least 3, n is an integer greater than 2**
