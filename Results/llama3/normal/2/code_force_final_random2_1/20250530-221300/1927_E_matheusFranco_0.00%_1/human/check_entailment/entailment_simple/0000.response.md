Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It constructs a k-level permutation of length n by filling in the permutation array in a specific order. The order is determined by the multiples of k plus i, where i ranges from 0 to k-1. This ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

The program first reads the number of test cases t, and then for each test case, it reads the values of n and k. It then constructs the permutation array and prints it.

The key insight here is that the program fills in the permutation array in a way that ensures the sums of continuous segments of length k are as evenly distributed as possible. This is achieved by filling in the array in a cyclic manner, where each cycle consists of k elements.

The program's correctness can be verified by analyzing the formula used to calculate the permutation array elements. The formula ensures that the elements are distributed in a way that minimizes the difference between the sums of continuous segments of length k.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
