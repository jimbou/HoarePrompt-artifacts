Output State: **permutation is a list of at least 6 values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is curr_v, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is curr_v + n/k + 2, multiples_of_k_plus_i is 2 + 2k, stdin is empty, i is 2, k is at least 3, n is an integer greater than 2**

In this output state, the value of permutation at index multiples_of_k_plus_i is updated to curr_v. The value of curr_v is incremented by 1, and then the value of multiples_of_k_plus_i is incremented by k. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
