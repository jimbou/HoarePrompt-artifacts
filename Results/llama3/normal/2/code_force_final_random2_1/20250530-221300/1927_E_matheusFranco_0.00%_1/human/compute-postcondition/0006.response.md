Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line calls the function `func_1()`, but since the function's definition is not provided, we cannot determine its exact effect on the program state. However, we can assume that it does not modify the value of `t`.

The second line decrements the value of `t` by 1. Since `t` is initially greater than 0, after this operation, `t` will be either greater than 0 (if it was initially greater than 1) or equal to 0 (if it was initially 1).

Therefore, the final state of the program is that `t` is greater than or equal to 0.
