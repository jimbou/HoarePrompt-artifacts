Correctness: **True**

Reasoning: 

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. 

Function `func_1` generates a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even and 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5. It constructs the permutation by iterating over multiples of k plus i, where i ranges from 0 to k-1, and assigns a value to each position in the permutation. The function then prints the permutation as a space-separated string of values.

Function `func_2` reads an integer from standard input and executes `func_1` a number of times equal to the input integer. This is consistent with the problem description, which states that the first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) â€” the number of test cases.

The execution summaries of the functions indicate that they behave as expected. `func_1` generates a permutation of n values based on the input parameters n and k, and `func_2` executes `func_1` a number of times equal to the input integer.

Therefore, the given program is correct and meets the problem description.
