Reasoning:

The program is correct. It correctly handles the edge cases where the input string has only one character or all characters are the same. In these cases, it prints 'NO' as required. For other cases, it generates a random permutation of the string and checks if it is the same as the original string. If it is, it generates a simple rotation of the string instead. This ensures that the output string is always different from the input string, as required.

The program also correctly handles the case where the input string has more than one distinct character and is not a single character. In this case, it prints 'YES' followed by the permuted string.

The use of random.sample to generate a random permutation of the string is also correct. This function returns a list of unique elements chosen from the population sequence, which is exactly what is needed to generate a random permutation of the string.

The only potential issue with the program is that it uses a random permutation, which means that the output may not be deterministic. However, this is not a problem according to the problem description, which allows for multiple possible answers.

Correctness: **True**
