Postcondition: ***`s` is a string that was the first input in `stdin`, `s2` is unknown, `stdin` contains the remaining inputs. If `s` has a length greater than 1 and all characters in `s` are the same, then 'No' is printed. Otherwise, `s2` is either a rotation of the characters in `s` by one position to the right or a string that is not a rotation of `s` by one position to the right, 'Yes' is printed, and `s2` is printed.***
