Postcondition: ***The string `s` is assigned the value of the integer input from stdin that is greater than 1, stdin is now empty. If all characters in `s` are the same and the length of `s` is more than 1, 'No' is being printed. Otherwise, `s2` is a string that is either a rotation of the characters in `s` by one position to the right or not, 'Yes' is being printed, and `s2` is printed.***
