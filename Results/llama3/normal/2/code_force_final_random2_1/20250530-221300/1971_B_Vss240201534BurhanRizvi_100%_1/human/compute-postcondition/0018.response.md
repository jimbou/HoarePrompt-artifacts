Postcondition: ***_ is 0, `int()` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `range()` is a range of integers from 0 to `int()-1`, `s` is a string of lowercase English letters of length more than 1 and at most 10, stdin contains one input: an integer between 1 and 1000. If `s` is a string with all the same characters and the length of `s` is more than 1, then 'No' is printed. Otherwise, `_` is 0, `int()` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `range()` is a range of integers from 0 to `int()-1`, `s` is a string of lowercase English letters of length more than 1 and at most 10, `s2` is a string of the same length as `s` containing the same characters as `s` but in a different order, stdin contains no input. If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is a rotated version of `s` with the first character moved to the end. Otherwise, no changes are made to `s` and `s2`, and 'Yes' is printed, and the string s2 is printed***
