The only objects in the loop head are variables `_` and `input()` and `int()` and `range()`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `input()` and `int()` and `range()`. If `input()` is an integer between 1 and 1000 the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (between 1 and 1000) and then a string of lowercase English letters of length at most 10. So for the loop to be executed  the `input()` must be an integer between 1 and 1000 and `_` is 0 and `int()` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and `range()` is a range of integers from 0 to `int()-1`.
State: **stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (between 1 and 1000) and then a string of lowercase English letters of length at most 10, `_` is 0, `int()` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `range()` is a range of integers from 0 to `int()-1`**
