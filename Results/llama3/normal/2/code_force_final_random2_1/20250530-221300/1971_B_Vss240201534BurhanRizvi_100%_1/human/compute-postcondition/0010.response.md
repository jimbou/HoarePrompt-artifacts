Output State: **`_` is 0, `int()` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `range()` is a range of integers from 0 to `int()-1`, `s` is a string of lowercase English letters of length more than 1 and at most 10, `s2` is a string of the same length as `s` containing the same characters as `s` but in a random order, stdin contains one input: an integer between 1 and 1000. The string `s` either has a length of 1 or contains at least two distinct characters.**

In this output state, the value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. The value of `int()` is still an integer between 1 and 1000, and `range()` is still a range of integers from 0 to `int()-1`. The string `s` remains a string of lowercase English letters of length more than 1 and at most 10, and it either has a length of 1 or contains at least two distinct characters. The new variable `s2` is a string of the same length as `s` containing the same characters as `s` but in a random order, generated by randomly sampling the characters of `s`. The stdin still contains one input: an integer between 1 and 1000.
