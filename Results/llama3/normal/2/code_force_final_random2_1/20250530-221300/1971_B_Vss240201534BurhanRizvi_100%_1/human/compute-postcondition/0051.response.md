Functionality: **This function reads a series of strings from the input, checks each string to see if it has more than one distinct character and is not a single character, and if so, generates a random permutation of the string (or a simple rotation if the random permutation happens to be the same as the original string), and prints 'Yes' followed by the permuted string. If the string does not meet these conditions, it prints 'No'. The function continues this process until all input strings have been processed, at which point the input buffer is empty.**
