Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

# Annotated Program:
import random

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (between 1 and 1000) and then a string of lowercase English letters of length at most 10.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        
    #State: The program has processed all the strings from the input and has printed 'Yes' or 'No' for each string based on the conditions specified in the loop. The input buffer is empty.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of strings from the input, checks each string to see if it has more than one distinct character and is not a single character, and if so, generates a random permutation of the string (or a simple rotation if the random permutation happens to be the same as the original string), and prints 'Yes' followed by the permuted string. If the string does not meet these conditions, it prints 'No'. The function continues this process until all input strings have been processed, at which point the input buffer is empty.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
