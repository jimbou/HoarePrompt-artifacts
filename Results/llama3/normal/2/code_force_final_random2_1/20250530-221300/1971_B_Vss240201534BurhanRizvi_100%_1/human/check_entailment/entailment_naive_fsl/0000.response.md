Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input string has a length of 2 and both characters are the same. In this case, the program will output "Yes" and then the original string, which is not a rearrangement of the original string. For example, if the input is "aa", the program will output "Yes" and then "aa", which is not a correct rearrangement.

The program should handle this case by checking if the length of the string is 2 and both characters are the same, and if so, output "No".
