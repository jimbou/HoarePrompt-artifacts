Output State: **The program has processed all the strings from the input and has printed 'Yes' or 'No' for each string based on the conditions specified in the loop. The input buffer is empty.**

In natural language, this means that the program has gone through all the strings provided as input, checked each string according to the conditions specified in the loop (length of the string, whether all characters are the same, and whether the string is equal to a rotated version of itself), and printed 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly. After processing all the strings, the input buffer is empty, indicating that all inputs have been consumed.
