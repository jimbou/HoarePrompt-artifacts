Postcondition: **The program processes a string `s` of lowercase English letters and an integer input from stdin. If `s` has a length of 1, it prints 'No'. If `s` has a length more than 1 and all characters are the same, it prints 'No'. If `s` has a length more than 1 and not all characters are the same, it checks if `s` is equal to a rotated version of itself with the first character moved to the end. If they are equal, it prints 'Yes' and the rotated string. If they are not equal, it prints 'Yes' and the original string.**
