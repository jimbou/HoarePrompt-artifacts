Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (between 1 and 1000) and then a string of lowercase English letters of length at most 10.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    s = input()
    if len(s) == 1:
        print('No')
    elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
        print('No')
    else:
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s == s2:
            s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
        print('Yes')
        print(s2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The program processes a string `s` of lowercase English letters and an integer input from stdin. If `s` has a length of 1, it prints 'No'. If `s` has a length more than 1 and all characters are the same, it prints 'No'. If `s` has a length more than 1 and not all characters are the same, it checks if `s` is equal to a rotated version of itself with the first character moved to the end. If they are equal, it prints 'Yes' and the rotated string. If they are not equal, it prints 'Yes' and the original string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The string `s` is assigned the value of the integer input from stdin that is greater than 1, stdin is now empty. If the length of `s` is 1, 'No' is printed. If the length of `s` is more than 1, then if all characters in `s` are the same, 'No' is printed. Otherwise, `s2` is a string that is either a rotation of the characters in `s` by one position to the right or not, 'Yes' is printed, and `s2` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a string that was the first input in `stdin`, `s2` is unknown, `stdin` contains the remaining inputs. If the length of `s` is 1, 'No' is printed. If the length of `s` is greater than 1 and all characters in `s` are the same, then 'No' is printed. Otherwise, `s2` is either a rotation of the characters in `s` by one position to the right or a string that is not a rotation of `s` by one position to the right, 'Yes' is printed, and `s2` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
