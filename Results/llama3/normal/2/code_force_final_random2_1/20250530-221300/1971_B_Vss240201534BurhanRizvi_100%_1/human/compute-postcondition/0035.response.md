To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is the implicit loop variable `_`, which is not used in the loop body. The loop also depends on the `input()` function, which reads from `stdin`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `stdin` is empty. For the loop to execute again, `stdin` must not be empty, and `input()` must return a value that can be converted to an integer.

Since `s` is assigned the value of the integer input from `stdin` that is greater than 1, we know that the input value is an integer greater than 1. However, we cannot determine the exact value of `s` or `s2` at the start of the next iteration, as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the state of `stdin`, which must not be empty for the loop to execute again.

State: **`s` is unknown, `s2` is unknown, `stdin` is not empty**
