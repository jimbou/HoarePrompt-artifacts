Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    s = input()
    s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
    if s != s2:
        print('Yes')
        print(s2)
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, _ is 0, t is greater than 0, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, s2 is a string consisting of the same characters as s but in a random order. If s is not equal to s2, 'Yes' is printed and the string s2 is printed. If s is equal to s2, 'No' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, s2 is a string consisting of the same characters as s but in a random order, stdin contains t-2 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, _ is 1, t is greater than 1. If s is not equal to s2, 'Yes' is printed and s2 is printed. If s is equal to s2, 'No' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, s2 is a string consisting of the same characters as s but in a random order, _ is 2, t is greater than 2, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If s is not equal to s2, 'Yes' is printed and s2 is printed. If s is equal to s2, 'No' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
