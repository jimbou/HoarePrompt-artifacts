Output State: **s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, s2 is a string consisting of the same characters as s but in a random order, _ is t-1, t is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains 0 strings. If s is not equal to s2, 'Yes' is printed and s2 is printed. If s is equal to s2, 'No' is printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the loop variable `_` will be equal to `t-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The variable `t` will be greater than or equal to 0, since the loop will have executed at least once. The input stream `stdin` will be empty, containing 0 strings. The variables `s` and `s2` will still be strings consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, with `s2` being a random permutation of `s`. The output will depend on whether `s` is equal to `s2`, printing 'Yes' and `s2` if they are not equal, and 'No' if they are equal.
