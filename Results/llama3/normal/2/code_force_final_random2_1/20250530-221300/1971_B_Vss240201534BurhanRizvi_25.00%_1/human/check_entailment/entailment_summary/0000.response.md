Reasoning:

The program is correct because it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads a string and randomizes its characters. If the randomized string is different from the original, it prints 'Yes' followed by the randomized string. If the randomized string is the same as the original, it prints 'No'. This is in line with the problem's requirements.

However, there is a small chance that the randomized string could be the same as the original string, especially for shorter strings. In such cases, the program would print 'No' even if a different arrangement is possible. But since the problem allows for the possibility of reporting 'No' if no different arrangement is possible, this does not make the program incorrect.

Correctness: **True**
