Output State: **s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, s2 is a string consisting of the same characters as s but in a random order, stdin contains t-2 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, _ is 1, t is greater than 1**

The first line assigns the next string from stdin to `s`. Since stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, `s` becomes one of these strings. The second line assigns a new string `s2` consisting of the same characters as `s` but in a random order. The length of `s2` is the same as `s`, which is at most 10. The value of `_` and `t` remains unchanged. Stdin now contains t-2 strings.
