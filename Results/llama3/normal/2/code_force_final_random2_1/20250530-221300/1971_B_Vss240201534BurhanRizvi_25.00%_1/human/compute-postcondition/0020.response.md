The only objects in the loop head are variables  _ and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _.  If the variable _ is less than t the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, t is greater than 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the variable _ is 2 and t is greater than 2.
State: **s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, s2 is a string consisting of the same characters as s but in a random order, stdin contains t-2 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, _ is 2, t is greater than 2**
