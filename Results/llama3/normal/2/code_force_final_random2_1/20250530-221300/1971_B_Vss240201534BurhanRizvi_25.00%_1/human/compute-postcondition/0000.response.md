To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there is an integer `t` in the input that is greater than 0.

State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, _ is 0, t is greater than 0**
