Correctness: **False**.

The program does not guarantee that the rearranged string `s2` will be different from the original string `s`. In the case where the input string `s` has only one unique character (e.g., "aaaaa"), the program will always output "No", which is correct. However, when the input string `s` has more than one unique character, the program uses `random.sample` to generate a new string `s2`. Although the probability of `s2` being the same as `s` is low, it is not impossible. 

For example, if the input string is "ab", the program may output "No" even though a rearranged string "ba" exists. This is because the `random.sample` function may happen to generate the same string as the original string `s`. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**.
