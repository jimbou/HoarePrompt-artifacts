Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is at least 2, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all integers in `a`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 1. `ans` is a list containing the updated value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is 0, `sums` is the updated value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0 and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `ans` also contains the new value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i` is not 0 and `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`, `ans` also contains the new value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[i - 1]`.***
