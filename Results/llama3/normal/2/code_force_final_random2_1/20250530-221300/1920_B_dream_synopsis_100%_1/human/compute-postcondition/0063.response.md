Output State: **n is an integer, k is at least 0, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, stdin is empty, ans is a list with one element equal to the sum of all integers in a plus a[i - 1], the maximum value in the list ans is not being printed, i is not equal to 0, and i + x - 1 is greater than or equal to n, sums is the sum of all integers in a plus a[i - 1].**

In this output state, the value of `sums` has been updated to include the value of `a[i - 1]`, which is the `i - 1`th element of the list `a`. The list `ans` now contains one element, which is the updated value of `sums`. All other variables remain unchanged.
