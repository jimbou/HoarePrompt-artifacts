Postcondition: **n is an integer, k is greater than 0, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, stdin contains no input, i is increased by 1, ans is a list containing the sum of all integers in a minus 2 times the value of a at index x plus the value of a at index 0, if x is less than n, otherwise ans contains the sum of all integers in a up to index 0. If i + x - 1 is less than n, then sums is the sum of all integers in a minus 2 times the value of a at index x plus the value of a at index 0, if x is less than n, otherwise sums contains the sum of all integers in a up to index 0, plus the value of a at index i - 1 minus 2 times the value of a at index i + x - 1. Otherwise, sums is the sum of all integers in a minus 2 times the value of a at index x plus the value of a at index 0, if x is less than n, otherwise sums contains the sum of all integers in a up to index 0 plus the value of a at index i-1.**
