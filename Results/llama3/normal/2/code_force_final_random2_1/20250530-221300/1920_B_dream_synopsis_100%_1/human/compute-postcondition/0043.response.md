Postcondition: ***n is an integer, k is greater than 0, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, stdin contains no input. If i + x - 1 is less than n, ans is a list containing the sum of all integers in a minus 2 times the value of a at index x plus the value of a at index 0, if x is less than n, otherwise ans contains the sum of all integers in a up to index 0, and sums is the sum of all integers in a minus 2 times the value of a at index x plus the value of a at index 0, if x is less than n, otherwise sums contains the sum of all integers in a up to index 0. Otherwise, ans contains the sum of all integers in a minus 2 times the value of a at index x plus the value of a at index 0, if x is less than n, otherwise ans contains the sum of all integers in a up to index 0, and sums is the sum of all integers in a up to index i - 1.***
