Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, ans is an empty list, stdin contains no input
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer, k is at least 0, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, stdin contains no input. If i is 0, then ans is a list containing the value of sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]). Otherwise, ans is a list containing the updated value of sums, where if i + x - 1 is less than n, then sums is the updated value of sums after adding a[i - 1] and subtracting 2 times a[i + x - 1]. If i + x - 1 is greater than or equal to n, then sums is the sum of all integers in a up to index i-1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, k is at least 1, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, stdin contains no input. If i is 0, then ans is a list containing the value of sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) and i is 1. Otherwise, ans is a list containing the updated value of sums. If i + x - 1 is less than n, then sums is the updated value of sums after adding a[i - 1] and subtracting 2 times a[i + x - 1]. If i + x - 1 is greater than or equal to n, then sums is the sum of all integers in a up to index i-1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `k` is at least 2, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all integers in `a`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 1. `ans` is a list containing the updated value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is 0, `sums` is the updated value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0 and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `ans` also contains the new value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i` is not 0 and `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`, `ans` also contains the new value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[i - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
