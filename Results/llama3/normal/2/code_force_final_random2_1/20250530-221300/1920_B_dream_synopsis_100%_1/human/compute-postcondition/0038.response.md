Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all integers in `a`, `stdin` contains no input. If `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `ans` is a list containing the sum of all integers in `a` minus 2 times the value of `a` at index `i + x - 1` plus the value of `a` at index `i - 1`, if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`. Otherwise, `ans` contains the sum of all integers in `a` up to index `i - 1`.***
