Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, stdin is empty, ans is an empty list, and the maximum value in the list ans is not being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `k` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all integers in `a`, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is 0, then `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, then if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `ans` is a list containing the updated value of `sums` after the execution of the code snippet. If `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is a list with one element equal to the sum of all integers in `a` plus `a[i - 1]`. In all cases, the maximum value in the list `ans` is not being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `k` is at least 1, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all integers in `a`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1 (if previously 0) or incremented by 1 (if previously not 0), and `ans` is updated accordingly based on the new value of `i`. If `i` is 0, `ans` is updated with the value of `sums` which is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `i` is incremented by 1, and if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `ans` is updated with the new value of `sums`, and `sums` is updated with the new value of `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated with the new sum of `a[i - 1]` added to the previous `sums`, and `sums` is the updated sum of `a[i - 1]` added to the previous `sums`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `k` is at least 2, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all integers in `a`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2. If `i` is 0, `ans` is updated with the new value of `sums` which is `sum1` - 2 * `sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, if `i` + `x` - 1 < `n`, `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` - 2 * `a[i + x - 1]` to its previous value and `ans` is updated accordingly based on the new value of `i`. If `i` + `x` - 1 >= `n`, `sums` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`, and `ans` is a list containing the sums of the first `i` elements of `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
