Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all integers in `a`, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is 0, then `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, then if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `ans` is a list containing the updated value of `sums` after the execution of the code snippet. If `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is a list with one element equal to the sum of all integers in `a` plus `a[i - 1]`. In all cases, the maximum value in the list `ans` is not being printed.***
