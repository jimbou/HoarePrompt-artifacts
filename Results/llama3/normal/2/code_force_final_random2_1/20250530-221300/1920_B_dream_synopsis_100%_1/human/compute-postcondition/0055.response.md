Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, stdin is empty, ans is an empty list, and the maximum value in the list ans is not being printed**

Here's a description of the final state:

* The values of `n`, `k`, and `x` are updated to the integer values read from the input.
* The list `a` is updated to contain the integers read from the input, sorted in descending order.
* The variable `sum1` is updated to be the sum of all integers in the list `a`.
* The `stdin` is now empty, as all input has been read.
* The list `ans` is initialized as an empty list.
* Since `ans` is an empty list, there is no maximum value to be printed.
