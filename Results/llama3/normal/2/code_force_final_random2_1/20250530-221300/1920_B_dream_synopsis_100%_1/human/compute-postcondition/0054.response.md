The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and the input() function, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input() function. If the input() function returns an integer greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains no input. So for the loop to be executed one more time the stdin must contain an integer greater than 0.
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all integers in `a`, `stdin` contains an integer greater than 0, `ans` is a list of integers, and the maximum value in the list `ans` is being printed**
