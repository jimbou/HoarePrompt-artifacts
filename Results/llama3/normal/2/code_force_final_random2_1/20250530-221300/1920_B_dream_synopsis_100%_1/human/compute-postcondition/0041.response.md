Output State: **n is an integer, k is greater than 0, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, ans is a list containing the sum of all integers in a minus 2 times the value of a at index x plus the value of a at index 0, if x is less than n, otherwise ans contains the sum of all integers in a up to index 0, sums is the sum of all integers in a minus 2 times the value of a at index x plus the value of a at index 0, if x is less than n, otherwise sums contains the sum of all integers in a up to index 0.**

In this output state, the value of `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `sum1` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `ans` is updated to contain the sum of all integers in `a` minus 2 times the value of `a` at index `x` plus the value of `a` at index `0`, if `x` is less than `n`. Otherwise, `ans` contains the sum of all integers in `a` up to index `0`. The value of `sums` is also updated to contain the same value as `ans`.
