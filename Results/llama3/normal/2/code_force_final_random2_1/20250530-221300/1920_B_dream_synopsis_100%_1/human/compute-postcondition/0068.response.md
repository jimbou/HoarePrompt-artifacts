Output State: **n is an integer, k is at least 1, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, stdin is empty, i is incremented by 1, ans is updated with the new value of sums, and sums is updated with the new value of a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1].**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the value of `ans` is updated with the new value of `sums`. The value of `sums` is updated by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`.
