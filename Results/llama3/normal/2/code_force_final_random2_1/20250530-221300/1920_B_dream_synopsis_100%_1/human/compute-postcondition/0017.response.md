Postcondition: **n is an integer, k is at least 1, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, stdin contains no input. If i is 0, then ans is a list containing the value of sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) and i is 1. Otherwise, ans is a list containing the updated value of sums. If i + x - 1 is less than n, then sums is the updated value of sums after adding a[i - 1] and subtracting 2 times a[i + x - 1]. If i + x - 1 is greater than or equal to n, then sums is the sum of all integers in a up to index i-1.**
