Based on the precondition, we know that `ans` is a list of integers. The `print` statement is trying to print the maximum value in the `ans` list.

Since the exact values in the `ans` list are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the maximum. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the maximum value in the `ans` list.

Output: **the maximum value in the ans list**
