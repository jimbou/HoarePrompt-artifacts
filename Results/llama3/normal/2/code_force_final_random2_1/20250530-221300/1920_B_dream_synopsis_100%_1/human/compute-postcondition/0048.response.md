Output State: **n is an integer, k is greater than 0, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, stdin contains no input, i is increased by 1, ans is a list containing the sum of all integers in a minus 2 times the value of a at index x plus the value of a at index 0, if x is less than n, otherwise ans contains the sum of all integers in a up to index 0, and sums is the sum of all integers in a minus 2 times the value of a at index x plus the value of a at index 0, if x is less than n, otherwise sums contains the sum of all integers in a up to index 0 plus the value of a at index i-1.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, and `stdin` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `i` is increased by 1. The value of `ans` is updated by appending the new value of `sums` to the list. The value of `sums` is updated by adding the value of `a` at index `i-1` to its previous value.
