The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 0.
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all integers in `a`, `stdin` contains no input. If `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the sum of all integers in `a` minus 2 times the value of `a` at index `x` plus the value of `a` at index `0`, if `x` is less than `n`. Otherwise, `ans` contains the sum of all integers in `a` up to index `0`.**
