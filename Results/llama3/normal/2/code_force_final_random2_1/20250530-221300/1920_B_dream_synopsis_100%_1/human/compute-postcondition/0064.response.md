Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all integers in `a`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is not equal to 0. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, then `ans` is a list containing the updated value of `sums` after the execution of the code snippet. If `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is a list with one element equal to the sum of all integers in `a` plus `a[i - 1]`. In both cases, the maximum value in the list `ans` is not being printed.***
