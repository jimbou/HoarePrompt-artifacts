Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all integers in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of sums, `stdin` contains no input, the maximum value in the list `ans` is not being printed, `i` is not equal to 0. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `ans` contains the sum of all integers in `a` minus 2 times the value of `a` at index `i + x - 1` plus the value of `a` at index `i - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` contains the sum of all integers in `a` up to index `i - 1`.***
