Output State: **n is an integer, k is greater than or equal to 0, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, ans is a list containing the value of sums, sums is the sum of all integers in a minus 2 times the value of a at index i + x - 1 plus the value of a at index i - 1, stdin contains no input, the maximum value in the list ans is not being printed, i is not equal to 0, and the current value of i plus x minus 1 is less than n.**

In this output state, the value of `sums` has been updated to include the difference between the value of `a` at index `i - 1` and twice the value of `a` at index `i + x - 1`. This updated value of `sums` has been appended to the list `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
