Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: the number of elements (n), a threshold (k), and a multiplier (x). The second line contains n integers. The function sorts these integers in descending order, calculates the sum of all integers, and then iterates k+1 times to calculate a series of sums by subtracting twice the value of the xth element and adding the previous element's value. It keeps track of these sums in a list and finally prints the maximum sum found. The function repeats this process for all test cases until standard input is empty.**
