Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is at least 2, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all integers in `a`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2. If `i` is 0, `ans` is updated with the new value of `sums` which is `sum1` - 2 * `sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, if `i` + `x` - 1 < `n`, `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` - 2 * `a[i + x - 1]` to its previous value and `ans` is updated accordingly based on the new value of `i`. If `i` + `x` - 1 >= `n`, `sums` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`, and `ans` is a list containing the sums of the first `i` elements of `a`.***
