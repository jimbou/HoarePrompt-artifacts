The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not specified, `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all integers in `a`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is increased by 1, `ans` is a list containing the sum of all integers in `a` minus 2 times the value of `a` at index `x` plus the value of `a` at index `0`, if `x` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans` contains the sum of all integers in `a` up to index `0`, and `sums` is the sum of all integers in `a` minus 2 times the value of `a` at index `x` plus the value of `a` at index `0`, if `x` is less than `n`, otherwise `sums` contains the sum of all integers in `a` up to index `0`.**
