Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is at least 1, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all integers in `a`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated accordingly based on the new value of `i`. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `ans` is updated with the new value of `sums`, and `sums` is updated with the new value of `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated with the new sum of `a[i - 1]` added to the previous `sums`, and `sums` is the updated sum of `a[i - 1]` added to the previous `sums`.***
