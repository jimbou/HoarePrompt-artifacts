Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, ans is an empty list, stdin contains no input, and the maximum value in the list ans is not being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all integers in `a`, `stdin` contains no input. If `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `ans` is a list containing the sum of all integers in `a` minus 2 times the value of `a` at index `i + x - 1` plus the value of `a` at index `i - 1`, if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`. Otherwise, `ans` contains the sum of all integers in `a` up to index `i - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all integers in `a`, `stdin` contains no input. If `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the sum of all integers in `a` minus 2 times the value of `a` at index `x` plus the value of `a` at index `0`, if `x` is less than `n`. Otherwise, `ans` contains the sum of all integers in `a` up to index `0`. If `i` is not 0, then if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `ans` is a list containing the sum of all integers in `a` minus 2 times the value of `a` at index `x` plus the value of `a` at index `0`, if `x` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans` contains the sum of all integers in `a` up to index `0`, and `sums` is the sum of all integers in `a` minus 2 times the value of `a` at index `x` plus the value of `a` at index `0`, if `x` is less than `n`, otherwise `sums` contains the sum of all integers in `a` up to index `0`. Otherwise, `ans` contains the sum of all integers in `a` minus 2 times the value of `a` at index `x` plus the value of `a` at index `0`, if `x` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans` contains the sum of all integers in `a` up to index `0`, and `sums` is the sum of all integers in `a` up to index `i - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer, k is greater than 0, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, stdin contains no input, i is increased by 1, ans is a list containing the sum of all integers in a minus 2 times the value of a at index x plus the value of a at index 0, if x is less than n, otherwise ans contains the sum of all integers in a up to index 0. If i is 0, then sums is the sum of all integers in a minus 2 times the value of a at index x plus the value of a at index 0, if x is less than n, otherwise sums contains the sum of all integers in a up to index 0. If i is not 0 and i + x - 1 is less than n, then sums is the sum of all integers in a minus 2 times the value of a at index x plus the value of a at index 0, if x is less than n, otherwise sums contains the sum of all integers in a up to index 0, plus the value of a at index i - 1 minus 2 times the value of a at index i + x - 1. If i is not 0 and i + x - 1 is not less than n, then sums is the sum of all integers in a minus 2 times the value of a at index x plus the value of a at index 0, if x is less than n, otherwise sums contains the sum of all integers in a up to index 0 plus the value of a at index i-1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
