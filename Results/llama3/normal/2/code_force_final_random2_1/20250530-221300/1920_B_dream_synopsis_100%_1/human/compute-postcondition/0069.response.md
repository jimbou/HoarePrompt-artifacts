Output State: **n is an integer, k is at least 1, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, stdin is empty, i is incremented by 1, ans is updated with the new sum of a[i - 1] added to the previous sums, and sums is the updated sum of a[i - 1] added to the previous sums.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, and `stdin` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the value of `ans` is updated by appending the new sum of `a[i - 1]` added to the previous sums. The value of `sums` is also updated by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` to the previous sums.
