Postcondition: ***n is an integer, k is at least 2, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, stdin is empty, i is 2, ans is updated accordingly based on the new value of i. If i + x - 1 < n, sums is updated by adding a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1] to its previous value. Otherwise, sums is the sum of the first i elements of a, and ans is a list containing the sums of the first i elements of a.***
