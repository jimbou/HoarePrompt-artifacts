#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of lowercase Latin letters.
    if (s == 'mapie') :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1.
    #State: s is a string of lowercase Latin letters, and s is not equal to 'mapie'
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
        
        ans += 1
        
    #State: s is a string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of 'map' removed, ans is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the initial string.
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
        
        ans += 1
        
    #State: Output State: s is a string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' removed, ans is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the initial string plus the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the initial string.
    return ans
    #The program returns the total number of occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the initial string.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a string of lowercase Latin letters as input and returns the total number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the input string. If the input string is exactly 'mapie', the function returns 1. Otherwise, it removes all occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' from the input string and returns the total count of these occurrences.
