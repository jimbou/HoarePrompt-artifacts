Output State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' removed, ans is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the initial string plus one**

The code first removes the first occurrence of 'pie' from the string `s`, and then increments the variable `ans` by 1. The initial state of `s` has all occurrences of 'map' removed, and it contains at least one occurrence of 'pie'. After the code executes, `s` no longer contains 'pie', and `ans` is incremented by 1.
