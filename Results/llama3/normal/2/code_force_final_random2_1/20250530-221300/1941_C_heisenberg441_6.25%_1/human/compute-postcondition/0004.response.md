To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the state of the variable `s` so that it contains the substring 'map'. Since `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and is not equal to 'mapie', we can modify its state to include 'map' as a substring.

State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and contains 'map' as a substring, `ans` is 0**
