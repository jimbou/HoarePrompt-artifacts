Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful. 

Here's why:

1. The program first checks if the string is equal to 'mapie'. If it is, it returns 1, which is correct because removing one character ('a') makes the string beautiful.

2. If the string is not equal to 'mapie', the program then enters a while loop that removes all occurrences of 'map' from the string. It does this by finding the index of 'map' in the string, removing the 'map' substring, and incrementing the answer counter. This process is repeated until there are no more occurrences of 'map' in the string.

3. After removing all occurrences of 'map', the program then enters another while loop that removes all occurrences of 'pie' from the string. It does this in a similar way to how it removed 'map'.

4. Finally, the program returns the total number of occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' that were removed. This is the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required functionality. 

Correctness: **True**
