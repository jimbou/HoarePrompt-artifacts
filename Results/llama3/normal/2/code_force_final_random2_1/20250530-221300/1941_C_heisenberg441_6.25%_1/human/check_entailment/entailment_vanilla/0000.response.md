Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a given string to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

The program defines a function `func_1(s)` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

The function first checks if the input string is equal to 'mapie'. If it is, the function returns 1, indicating that one character needs to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

If the input string is not 'mapie', the function enters a while loop that continues until the string no longer contains the substring 'map'. In each iteration of the loop, the function finds the index of the first occurrence of 'map' in the string, removes the first two characters of 'map' from the string, and increments the count of characters to be deleted.

After the while loop, the function enters another while loop that continues until the string no longer contains the substring 'pie'. In each iteration of this loop, the function finds the index of the first occurrence of 'pie' in the string, removes the first two characters of 'pie' from the string, and increments the count of characters to be deleted.

Finally, the function returns the total count of characters to be deleted.

The main part of the program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the length of the string and the string itself. It then calls the `func_1(s)` function with the input string and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
