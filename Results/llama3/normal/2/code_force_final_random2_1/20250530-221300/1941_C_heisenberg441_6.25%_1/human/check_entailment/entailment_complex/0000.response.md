Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make a given string beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "map" or "pie".

The program defines a function `func_1(s)` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

The function first checks if the input string is exactly "mapie", in which case it returns 1. This is because "mapie" contains both "map" and "pie", and deleting one character would make the string beautiful.

If the input string is not "mapie", the function then removes all occurrences of "map" and "pie" from the string using a while loop. The number of occurrences of "map" and "pie" is counted and stored in the variable `ans`.

Finally, the function returns the total count of "map" and "pie" occurrences, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

The program then reads the number of test cases `t` and the length of the string `n` for each test case. It reads the string `s` and calls the function `func_1(s)` to get the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted. The result is printed for each test case.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make a string beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
