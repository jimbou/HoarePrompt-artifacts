Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the string contains both "map" and "pie" and they overlap. For example, the string "mapie" is not handled correctly by the program. The program returns 1 for this case, but it should return 2 because both "map" and "pie" need to be removed to make the string beautiful.

The issue is that the program checks for "map" and "pie" separately and removes them one by one, but it does not consider the case when they overlap. To fix this, the program should check for the overlapping case and remove both "map" and "pie" at the same time.

For example, the correct output for the string "mapie" should be 2, not 1.
