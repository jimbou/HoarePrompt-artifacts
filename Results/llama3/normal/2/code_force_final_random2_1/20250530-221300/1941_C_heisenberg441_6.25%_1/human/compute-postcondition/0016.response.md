Output State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin letters with 'ie' in it and without 'pie' in it, ans is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the initial string plus three**

The code first removes the substring 'pie' from the string s, leaving 'ie' intact. Then, it increments the variable ans by 1. The initial value of ans was the number of occurrences of 'map' in the initial string plus two, so after the increment, ans becomes the number of occurrences of 'map' in the initial string plus three.
