According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s.find('pie')` is not equal to -1, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of 'map' removed. This does not ensure that the loop will execute, so `s` needs to be adjusted to contain at least one occurrence of 'pie'. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of 'map' removed and contains at least one occurrence of 'pie', `ans` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the initial string**
