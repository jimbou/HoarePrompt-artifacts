According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable s. If s.find('pie') != -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, s is a string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' removed. This means that s.find('pie') is -1, so for the loop to be executed one more time s must have 'pie' in it. 
State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin letters with 'pie' in it and all occurrences of 'map' removed, ans is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the initial string plus one**
