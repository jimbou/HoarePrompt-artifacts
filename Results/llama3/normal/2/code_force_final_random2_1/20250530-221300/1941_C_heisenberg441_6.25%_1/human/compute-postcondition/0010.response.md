Output State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of 'map' removed, ans is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the initial string.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing, the string `s` will have all occurrences of the substring 'map' removed, and the variable `ans` will be equal to the number of times 'map' appeared in the original string.
