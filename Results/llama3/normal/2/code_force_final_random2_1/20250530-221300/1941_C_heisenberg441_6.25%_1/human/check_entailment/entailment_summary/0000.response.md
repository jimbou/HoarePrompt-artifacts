Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The program first checks if the input string is exactly 'mapie' and returns 1 in that case. Otherwise, it removes all occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' from the input string and returns the total count of these occurrences.

The program uses a while loop to find and remove all occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' from the input string. It uses the find() method to find the index of the first occurrence of 'map' or 'pie' in the string, and then removes the corresponding characters from the string. The count of removed characters is incremented in each iteration.

The program correctly handles the case where the input string is already beautiful (i.e., does not contain 'map' or 'pie') by returning 0 in that case.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
