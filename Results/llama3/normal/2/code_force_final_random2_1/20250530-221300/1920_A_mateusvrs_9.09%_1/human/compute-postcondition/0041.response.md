Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing at least 3 `x` values where `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `bx` is less than `ax`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is 3. Otherwise, `tmp` is 2, `i` is the third element in the set `cx`.**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been incremented by 1. If `i` is within the range of `bx` to `ax` (inclusive), `tmp` is now 3; otherwise, it is 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
