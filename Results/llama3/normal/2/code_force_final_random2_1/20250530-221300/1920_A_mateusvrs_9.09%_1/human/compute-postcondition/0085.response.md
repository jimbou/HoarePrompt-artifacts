The only object in the loop head is variable `i` and set `cx`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `cx`. If the set `cx` has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `cx` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `cx`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the set `cx` must have at least 3 elements and the `i` is the third element of `cx`.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than `n + 1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `cx` is a set containing at least three elements, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `bx` is less than `ax`, `i` is the third element of `cx`. If the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is 2. Otherwise, `tmp` is 1.**
