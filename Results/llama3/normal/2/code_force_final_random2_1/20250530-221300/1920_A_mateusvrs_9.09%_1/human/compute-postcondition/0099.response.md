Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `n` + 1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `ax` is an integer equal to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set, `a` is an integer equal to 2, `x` is an integer, and an error has occurred because stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `ax` has been updated to be the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. The other variables remain unchanged. However, since `a` and `x` were supposed to be assigned new values from the input, but stdin contains no input, an error has occurred.
