Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing all `x` values where `a` is neither 1 nor 2, and stdin contains no more input. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, then `r` contains 0. Otherwise, `r` contains `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax` if all elements in `cx` are within this range, or the number of elements in `cx` that meet this condition otherwise.***
