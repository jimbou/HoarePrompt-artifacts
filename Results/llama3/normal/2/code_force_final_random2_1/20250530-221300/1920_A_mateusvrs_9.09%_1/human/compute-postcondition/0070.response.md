Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `n + 1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `cx` is a set containing one or two elements `x` if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing one or two elements `x`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `cx` has been updated to include `x` as an additional element, regardless of the value of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
