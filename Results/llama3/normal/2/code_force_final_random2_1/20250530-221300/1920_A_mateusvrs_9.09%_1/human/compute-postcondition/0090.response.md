Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than `n + 1`, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `cx` is a set containing one or more elements `x`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains no input. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, then `r` contains two elements. Otherwise, `r` contains two elements, the first element is the same as before and the second element is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, `cx` is an empty set, and `bx` is less than `ax`, where `tmp` is equal to the number of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.***
