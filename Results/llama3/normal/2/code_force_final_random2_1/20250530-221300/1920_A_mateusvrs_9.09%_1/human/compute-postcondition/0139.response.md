Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n lines of two integers a and x. It then processes these test cases to determine the number of possible values of k that satisfy certain constraints. The constraints are: if a=1, k must be greater than or equal to x; if a=2, k must be less than or equal to x; and if a=3, k must not be equal to x. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of possible values of k for the corresponding test case. If there are no possible values of k for a test case, the function returns 0 for that test case.**
