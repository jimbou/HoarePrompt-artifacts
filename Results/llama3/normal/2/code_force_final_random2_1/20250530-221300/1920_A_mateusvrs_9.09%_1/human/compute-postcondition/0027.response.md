Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is at least 3, `_` is 2, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers. If `a` is 1, `ax` is 1000000007, `x` is an integer, and `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. Otherwise, `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` contains the integer `x`.***
