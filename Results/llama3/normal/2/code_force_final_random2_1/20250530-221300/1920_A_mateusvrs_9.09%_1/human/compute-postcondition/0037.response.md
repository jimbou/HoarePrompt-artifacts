The only object in the loop head is variable `i` and set `cx`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `cx`.  If the set `cx` has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `cx` has at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the set `cx`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the set `cx` must have at least 2 elements and the `i` is the second element in the set `cx`.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing at least 2 `x` values where `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `bx` is less than `ax`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, `tmp` is 0, `i` is the second element in the set `cx`.**
