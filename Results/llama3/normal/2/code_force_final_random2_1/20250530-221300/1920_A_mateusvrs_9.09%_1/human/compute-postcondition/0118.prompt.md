Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than n + 1, r is a list containing two elements, _ is n + 1, n is an integer, ax is 1000000007, bx is -1, cx is an empty set, a is an integer, x is an integer, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    a, x = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 1:
        bx = max(x, bx)
    elif a == 2:
        ax = min(x, ax)
    else:
        cx.add(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than `n` + 1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, and an error has occurred because stdin contains no input. If `a` is equal to 1, then `bx` is `max(x, -1)`. If `a` is equal to 2, then `ax` is an integer equal to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. Otherwise, `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing one element which is an integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than `n` + 1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, and an error has occurred because stdin contains no input. If `a` is equal to 1, then `bx` is `max(x, -1)`. If `a` is equal to 2, then `ax` is an integer equal to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is not equal to 1 or 2, then `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing one element which is an integer `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than `n` + 1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, an error has occurred because stdin contains no input, and the program has stopped executing. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `bx`. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is either `x` or `ax` whichever is smaller. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, then `cx` is a set containing the value of `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
