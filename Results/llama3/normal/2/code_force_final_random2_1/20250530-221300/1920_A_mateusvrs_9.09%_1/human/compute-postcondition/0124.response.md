Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than `n` + 1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is an integer, `bx` is an integer, `cx` is a set that must not be empty, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `tmp` is 0, and an error has occurred because stdin contains no input. If `a` is 1, then the current value of `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` is 2, then the current value of `ax` is either `x` or the previous value of `ax`, whichever is smaller. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, then `cx` contains the value of `x`. Additionally, `bx` is less than `ax`, and `i` is an element in `cx`. The current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`***
