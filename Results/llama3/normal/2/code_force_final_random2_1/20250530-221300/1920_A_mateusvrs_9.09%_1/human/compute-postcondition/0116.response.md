Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than `n` + 1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, an error has occurred because stdin contains no input, `a` and `x` are assigned the values from the input but since stdin contains no input an error has occurred and the program has stopped executing. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is either `x` or `ax` whichever is smaller. Otherwise, `cx` is a set containing the value of `x`.***
