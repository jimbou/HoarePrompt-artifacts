Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `a` is 1, `x` is an integer, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, and `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values except for `bx`, which is now the maximum of its original value (-1) and the value of `x`. The input state also remains the same, with multiple test cases minus two integers still in the standard input.
