Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is at least 2, `ax` is 1000000007, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The value of `t` remains an integer greater than 0. The list `r` is still empty. The value of `n` is still at least 2. The value of `ax` is still 1000000007. The value of `_` is still 1. The variable `a` is assigned an integer value from the input, and `x` is also assigned an integer value from the input. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two integers. The values of `bx` and `cx` depend on the value of `a`. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`.
