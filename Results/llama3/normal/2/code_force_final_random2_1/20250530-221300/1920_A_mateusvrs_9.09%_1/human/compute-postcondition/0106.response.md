Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `n` + 1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `bx` is `max(x, max(x, -1))` if `a` is equal to 1, `bx` is `max(x, min(x, 1000000007))` if `a` is equal to 2, otherwise `bx` is `max(x, 1000000007)`, and an error has occurred because stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `bx` has been updated based on the value of `a`. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. Otherwise, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and 1000000007. The other variables remain unchanged. The error due to stdin containing no input still exists.
