Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is at least 3, `ax` is 1000000007, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `_` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `bx` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains a space-separated list of integers.
