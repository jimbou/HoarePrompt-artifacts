Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `a` is an integer that is not equal to 1, `x` is an integer, `_` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers. If `a` is equal to 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. Otherwise, `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`.***
