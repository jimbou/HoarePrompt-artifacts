Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than `n` + 1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, and an error has occurred because stdin contains no input. If `a` is equal to 1, then `bx` is `max(x, -1)`. If `a` is equal to 2, then `ax` is an integer equal to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. Otherwise, `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing one element which is an integer.***
