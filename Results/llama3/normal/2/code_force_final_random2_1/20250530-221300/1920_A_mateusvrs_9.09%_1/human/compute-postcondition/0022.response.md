Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is at least 3, `ax` is 1000000007, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `_` is 2, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `r`, `n`, `ax`, and `_` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `x` are updated to be integers, which are obtained from the input. The stdin now contains a space-separated list of integers.
