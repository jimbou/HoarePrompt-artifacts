Output State: **t is an integer greater than n + 1, r is a list containing two elements, _ is n + 1, n is an integer, ax is 1000000007, bx is -1, cx is an empty set, a is an integer, x is an integer, stdin contains no input.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `n`, `cx`, `ax`, and `bx`. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, but since stdin contains no input, this line does not change the value of `n`. The second line assigns an empty set to `cx`. The third line assigns the value of 1000000007 to `ax`. The fourth line assigns the value of -1 to `bx`. The values of `t`, `r`, `_`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.
