Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `n` + 1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is either `x` or `ax` whichever is smaller, an error has occurred because stdin contains no input, `a` and `x` are assigned the values from the input but since stdin contains no input an error has occurred and the program has stopped executing.**

The code assigns the value of `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`. Since `a` and `x` are assigned the values from the input but since stdin contains no input an error has occurred and the program has stopped executing, the values of `a` and `x` are not changed. The values of the other variables are not affected. The error that occurred because stdin contains no input is still valid.
