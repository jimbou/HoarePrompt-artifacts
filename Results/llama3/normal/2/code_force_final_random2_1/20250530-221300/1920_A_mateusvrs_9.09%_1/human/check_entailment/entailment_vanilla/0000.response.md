Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. The program correctly handles the three types of constraints:

1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x.
2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x.
3. k must be not equal to some integer x.

The program initializes variables ax and bx to store the maximum and minimum values of x for constraints of type 1 and 2, respectively. It also uses a set cx to store the values of x for constraints of type 3.

The program then iterates over the constraints, updating ax, bx, and cx accordingly. After processing all constraints, it checks if bx is greater than or equal to ax. If so, it means that there are no integers k that satisfy all constraints, and the program appends 0 to the result list.

Otherwise, the program calculates the number of integers k that satisfy all constraints by subtracting the number of integers in cx that are within the range [bx, ax] from the total number of integers in the range [bx, ax]. This is done using the formula ax - bx + 1 - tmp, where tmp is the number of integers in cx that are within the range [bx, ax].

Finally, the program prints the results for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
