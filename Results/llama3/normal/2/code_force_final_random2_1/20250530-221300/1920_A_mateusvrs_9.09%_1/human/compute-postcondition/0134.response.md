Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `n` + 1, `r` is a list containing three elements, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is an integer, `bx` is an integer, `cx` is a set, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that are within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), and an error has occurred because stdin contains no input. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `bx`. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is either `x` or `ax` whichever is smaller. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, then `cx` contains the value of `x`. Additionally, `bx` is less than `ax`.**

In this output state, the list `r` now contains three elements, with the new element being the result of the expression `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. The other variables remain unchanged, with their values still satisfying the conditions specified in the initial state. The error due to stdin containing no input still persists.
