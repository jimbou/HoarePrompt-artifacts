Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than `n + 1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains no input. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is a set containing one element `x`. Otherwise, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, and `cx` is a set containing one or two elements `x`.***
