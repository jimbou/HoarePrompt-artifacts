Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing at least one `x` value where `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `tmp` is 1, `i` is the first element in `cx`, `bx` is less than `ax`, and `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and their relationships and properties are still valid.
