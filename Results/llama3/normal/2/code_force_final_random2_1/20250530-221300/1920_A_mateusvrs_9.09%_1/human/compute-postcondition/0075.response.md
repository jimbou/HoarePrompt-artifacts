Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `n + 1`, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `cx` is a set containing one or more elements `x`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains no input. The current value of `bx` is greater than or equal to the current value of `ax`.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to a list containing two elements, where the second element is 0. The other variables remain unchanged, and the relationship between `bx` and `ax` is still valid.
