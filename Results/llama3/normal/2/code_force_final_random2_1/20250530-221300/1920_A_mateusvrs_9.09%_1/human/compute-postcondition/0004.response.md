Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `_` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers**.

In this output state, the values of `t`, `r`, `_`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, and `bx` remain unchanged. The variables `a` and `x` are assigned integer values from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two integers, as two integers have been consumed by the input operation.
