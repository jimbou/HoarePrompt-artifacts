Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is at least 3, `ax` is 1000000007, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `_` is 2, `cx` contains the integer `x`, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the variable `cx` has been updated to contain the integer value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains a space-separated list of integers.
