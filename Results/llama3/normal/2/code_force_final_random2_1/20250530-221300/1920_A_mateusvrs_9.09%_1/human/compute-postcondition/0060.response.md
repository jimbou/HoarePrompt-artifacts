Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `n + 1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `cx` is a set containing one element `x` if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is an empty set, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `r`, `_`, and `n` remain unchanged. The values of `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` are updated based on the new values of `a` and `x`, which are assigned from the input. The stdin is empty since the input has been consumed.
