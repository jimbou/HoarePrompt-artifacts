To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the set `cx`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `cx`. If `cx` is not empty, the loop can execute. Since `cx` is a set containing the value of `x` when `a` is neither 1 nor 2, we need to adjust the state of `cx` to ensure it is not empty.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than `n` + 1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is an integer, `bx` is an integer, `cx` is a set that must not be empty, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `tmp` is 0, and an error has occurred because stdin contains no input. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `bx`. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is either `x` or `ax` whichever is smaller. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, then `cx` contains the value of `x`. Additionally, `bx` is less than `ax`, and `i` is an element in `cx`**
