Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `n` + 1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is an integer, `bx` is an integer, `cx` is a set that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `tmp` is either 1 or 2, and an error has occurred because stdin contains no input. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `bx`. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is either `x` or `ax` whichever is smaller. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, then `cx` contains the value of `x`. Additionally, `bx` is less than `ax`, and `i` is an element in `cx`. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), then `i` is within this range.**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been incremented by 1. If `tmp` was initially 1 (when `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax`), it is now 2. If `tmp` was initially 0 (when `i` is not within the range of `bx` and `ax`), it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
