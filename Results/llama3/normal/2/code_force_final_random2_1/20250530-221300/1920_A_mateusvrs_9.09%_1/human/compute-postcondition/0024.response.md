Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is at least 3, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `_` is 2, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `ax` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value (1000000007) and the value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains a space-separated list of integers.
