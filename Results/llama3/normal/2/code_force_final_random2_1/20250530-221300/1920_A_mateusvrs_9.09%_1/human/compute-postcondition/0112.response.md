Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `n` + 1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, an error has occurred because stdin contains no input, `a` and `x` are assigned the values from the input but since stdin contains no input an error has occurred and the program has stopped executing.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `r`, `_`, and `n` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `x` are assigned from the input, but since stdin contains no input, an error has occurred and the program has stopped executing. The program cannot continue executing because it is waiting for input that is not available.
