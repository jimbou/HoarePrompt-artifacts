The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is `n`, `t` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is `n + 1` and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than `n + 1`.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than n + 1, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing all `x` values where `a` is neither 1 nor 2, and stdin contains no more input. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, then `r` contains 0. Otherwise, `r` contains `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax` if all elements in `cx` are within this range, or the number of elements in `cx` that meet this condition otherwise.**
