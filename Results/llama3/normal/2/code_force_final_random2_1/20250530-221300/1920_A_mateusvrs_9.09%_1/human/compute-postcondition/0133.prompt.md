Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than `n` + 1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is an integer, `bx` is an integer, `cx` is a set, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `tmp` is 0, and an error has occurred because stdin contains no input. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `bx`. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is either `x` or `ax` whichever is smaller. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, then `cx` is a set containing the value of `x`. Additionally, `bx` is less than `ax`.
Code of the loop:
for i in cx:
    if i >= bx and i <= ax:
        tmp += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than `n` + 1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is an integer, `bx` is an integer, `cx` is a set that must not be empty, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, and an error has occurred because stdin contains no input. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `bx`. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is either `x` or `ax` whichever is smaller. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, then `cx` contains the value of `x`. Additionally, `bx` is less than `ax`, and `i` is an element in `cx`. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), then `tmp` is set to 1 and `i` is within this range. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than `n` + 1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is an integer, `bx` is an integer, `cx` is a set that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, and an error has occurred because stdin contains no input. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `bx`. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is either `x` or `ax` whichever is smaller. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, then `cx` contains the value of `x`. Additionally, `bx` is less than `ax`, and `i` is an element in `cx`. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), then `tmp` is set to 1 and `i` is within this range. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than `n` + 1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is an integer, `bx` is an integer, `cx` is a set that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `i` is the next element in `cx`, and an error has occurred because stdin contains no input. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), `tmp` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
