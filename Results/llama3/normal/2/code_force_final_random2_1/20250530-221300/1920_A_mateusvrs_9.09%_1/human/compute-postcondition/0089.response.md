Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `n + 1`, `r` is a list containing two elements, the first element is the same as before and the second element is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `bx` is less than `ax`, `i` is not defined, `tmp` is equal to the number of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.**

In this output state, the list `r` now contains two elements, the first element is the same as before, and the second element is the result of the expression `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. The value of `tmp` is still equal to the number of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, but since `cx` is an empty set, `tmp` is 0. Therefore, the second element of `r` is actually `ax - bx + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
