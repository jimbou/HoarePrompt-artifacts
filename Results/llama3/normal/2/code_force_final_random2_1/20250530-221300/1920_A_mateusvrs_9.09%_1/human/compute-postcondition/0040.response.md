To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `i` and the set `cx`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `cx` has at least one more element. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second element in the set `cx`, and `cx` has at least 2 elements.

For the loop to execute again, `cx` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` must be the third element in the set `cx`.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing at least 3 `x` values where `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `bx` is less than `ax`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is 2. Otherwise, `tmp` is 1, `i` is the third element in the set `cx`.**
