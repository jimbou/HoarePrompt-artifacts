Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer, r is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cx = set()
    ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
    bx = -1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, x = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1:
            bx = max(x, bx)
        elif a == 2:
            ax = min(x, ax)
        else:
            cx.add(x)
    if bx >= ax:
        r.append(0)
    else:
        tmp = 0
        for i in cx:
            if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                tmp += 1
        r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing all `x` values where `a` is neither 1 nor 2, and stdin contains no more input. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, then `r` contains 0. Otherwise, `r` contains `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax` if all elements in `cx` are within this range, or the number of elements in `cx` that meet this condition otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than `n + 1`, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `cx` is a set containing one or more elements `x`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains no input. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, then `r` contains two elements. Otherwise, `r` contains two elements, the first element is the same as before and the second element is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, `cx` is an empty set, and `bx` is less than `ax`, where `tmp` is equal to the number of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than `n` + 1, `r` is a list containing three elements, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is an integer, `bx` is an integer, `cx` is a set, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, and an error has occurred because stdin contains no input. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `bx`. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is either `x` or `ax` whichever is smaller. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, then `cx` contains the value of `x`. Additionally, if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, then the current value of `bx` is greater than or equal to the current value of `ax`. Otherwise, `bx` is less than `ax` and `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that are within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
