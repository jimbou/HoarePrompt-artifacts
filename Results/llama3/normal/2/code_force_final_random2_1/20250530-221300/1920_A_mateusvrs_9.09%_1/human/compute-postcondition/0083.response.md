Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `n + 1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `cx` is a set containing at least two elements, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `bx` is less than `ax`, `i` is the second element of `cx`. If the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is 2. Otherwise, `tmp` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax`, then `tmp` is now 2. Otherwise, `tmp` is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
