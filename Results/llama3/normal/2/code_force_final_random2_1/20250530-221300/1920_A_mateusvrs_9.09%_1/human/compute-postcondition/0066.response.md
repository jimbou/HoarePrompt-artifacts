To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for _ in range(n):`. The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `n` is an integer greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than `n + 1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `cx` is a set containing one element `x` if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing one or two elements `x`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains no input.**
