Output State: **t is an integer, r is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case starts with an integer, `t` becomes the value of the first integer in stdin. The second line initializes an empty list `r`. No other variables are affected.
