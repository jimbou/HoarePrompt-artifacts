Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It initializes the minimum and maximum possible values of k (bx and ax) and a set to store the values that k cannot be equal to (cx). It then iterates over the constraints, updating bx, ax, and cx accordingly.

The program checks if bx is greater than or equal to ax, in which case it means that there are no possible values of k that satisfy all constraints, so it appends 0 to the result list. Otherwise, it calculates the number of possible values of k by subtracting bx from ax, adding 1, and then subtracting the number of values in cx that are within the range [bx, ax].

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the case where there are no possible values of k, and the case where there are multiple constraints of type 3 (k cannot be equal to x). The use of a set to store the values that k cannot be equal to ensures that duplicate values are ignored, and the program correctly handles the case where the same value is constrained multiple times.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
