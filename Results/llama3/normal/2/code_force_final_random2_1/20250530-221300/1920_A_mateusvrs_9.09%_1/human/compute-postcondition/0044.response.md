Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is a list containing one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set, `bx` is less than `ax`. If all `i` in `cx` are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx`. Otherwise, `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to include one element which is the result of the expression `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `tmp` depends on the elements in `cx` and their relationship with `bx` and `ax`.
