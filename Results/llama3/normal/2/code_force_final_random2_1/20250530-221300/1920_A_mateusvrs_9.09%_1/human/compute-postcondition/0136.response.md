Output State: **`t` is 0, `r` is a list containing `t` elements, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is an integer, `bx` is an integer, `cx` is a set, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, and stdin contains no input. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, then `r` contains `t` zeros. Otherwise, `r` contains `t` elements, each of which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax` if all elements in `cx` are within this range, or the number of elements in `cx` that meet this condition otherwise.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` becomes 0, and the list `r` contains `t` elements, each of which is either 0 or the difference between `ax` and `bx` plus 1 minus the number of elements in `cx` that are within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive). The other variables `n`, `ax`, `bx`, `cx`, `a`, and `x` retain their last values after the loop finishes executing, and there is no more input in stdin.
