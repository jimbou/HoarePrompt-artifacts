Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is at least 2, `ax` is 1000000007, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `x`, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `bx` has been updated. If `a` is 1, `bx` is now the maximum of `x` and itself, which means `bx` is now equal to `x`. If `a` is 2, the value of `bx` is not affected. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `bx` is now the maximum of `x` and -1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
