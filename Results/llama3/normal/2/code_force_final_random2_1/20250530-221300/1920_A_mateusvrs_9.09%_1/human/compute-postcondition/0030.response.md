Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is a list containing one element which is 0, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing all `x` values where `a` is neither 1 nor 2, and stdin contains no more input. The current value of `bx` is greater than or equal to the current value of `ax`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still an integer greater than 0, and the value of `n` is still an integer. The value of `_` is still `n`. The list `r` now contains one element which is 0. The values of `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` are still the same, with `bx` being greater than or equal to `ax`. There is no more input in stdin.
