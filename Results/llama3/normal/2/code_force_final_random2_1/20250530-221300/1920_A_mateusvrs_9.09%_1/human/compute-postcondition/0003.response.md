To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `_` is 0, which is the initial value for the loop variable. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one integer, `_` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1**
