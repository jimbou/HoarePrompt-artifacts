Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than `n` + 1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is an integer, `bx` is an integer, `cx` is a set that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `i` is the next element in `cx`, and an error has occurred because stdin contains no input. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), `tmp` is increased by 1.***
