The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than `n` + 1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, and an error has occurred because stdin contains no input. If `a` is equal to 1, then `bx` is `max(x, -1)`. If `a` is equal to 2, then `ax` is an integer equal to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. Otherwise, `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing one element which is an integer.**
