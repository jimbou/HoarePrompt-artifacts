Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `n` + 1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is `max(x, -1)`, `cx` is an empty set, `a` is an integer with a current value of 1, `x` is an integer, and an error occurs because `a` and `x` are assigned new values from the input, but stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `r`, `_`, `n`, `ax`, and `cx` remain unchanged. The value of `bx` is updated to be the maximum of `x` and `-1`. The values of `a` and `x` are not updated because the input operation fails due to the absence of input in stdin.
