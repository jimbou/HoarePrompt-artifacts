Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `n` + 1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is an integer, `bx` is an integer, `cx` is an empty set, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that are within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), and an error has occurred because stdin contains no input. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `bx`. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is either `x` or `ax` whichever is smaller. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, then `cx` contains the value of `x`. Additionally, `bx` is less than `ax`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the set `cx` is empty, and the variable `tmp` now holds the count of elements in `cx` that were within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive) before the loop started. All other variables remain unchanged.
