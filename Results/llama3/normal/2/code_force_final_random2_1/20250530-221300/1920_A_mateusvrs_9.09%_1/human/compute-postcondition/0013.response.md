Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `x` is an integer, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `ax` is 1000000007, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`.***
