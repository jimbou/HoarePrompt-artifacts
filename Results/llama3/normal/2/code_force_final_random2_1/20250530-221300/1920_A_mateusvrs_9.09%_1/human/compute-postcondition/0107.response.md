Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `n` + 1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`, and an error has occurred because stdin contains no input. If `a` is equal to 1, then `bx` is `max(x, -1)`. If `a` is equal to 2, then `ax` is an integer equal to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. Otherwise, `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing one element which is an integer.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ax` has been updated to be the minimum of `x` and its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged, and the error due to stdin containing no input still exists. The relationships between `a`, `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` are still valid, depending on the value of `a`.
