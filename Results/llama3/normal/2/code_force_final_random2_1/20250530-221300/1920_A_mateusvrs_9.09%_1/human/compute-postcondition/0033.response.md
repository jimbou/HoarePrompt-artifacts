To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `cx`. The loop will execute if `cx` has at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `cx` to have at least one element.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing at least one `x` value where `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `tmp` is 0, `i` is the first element in `cx`, and stdin contains no more input. Additionally, `bx` is less than `ax`.**
