Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `n + 1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `cx` is a set containing one or two elements `x` if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing one element `x`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than `n + 1`, the list `r` still contains one element, the value of `_` is still 1, the value of `n` is still greater than 1, the value of `ax` is still the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 2, otherwise it is still 1000000007, the value of `bx` is still the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise it is still -1, the set `cx` now contains one or two elements `x` if `a` is 2, otherwise it contains one element `x`, the value of `a` is still an integer, the value of `x` is still an integer, and there is still no input in stdin.
