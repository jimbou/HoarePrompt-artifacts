Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `n + 1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `cx` is a set containing at least one element `x`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `tmp` is 1, `bx` is less than `ax`, `i` is the first element of `cx`, and the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `tmp` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships. The set `cx` still contains at least one element `x`, and the current value of `i` remains within the range defined by `bx` and `ax`.
