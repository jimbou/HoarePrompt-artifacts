Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing all `x` values where `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `tmp` is 0, and stdin contains no more input. Additionally, `bx` is less than `ax`.**

In this output state, a new variable `tmp` has been introduced and assigned the value 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `bx` and `ax` is still valid, and stdin still contains no more input.
