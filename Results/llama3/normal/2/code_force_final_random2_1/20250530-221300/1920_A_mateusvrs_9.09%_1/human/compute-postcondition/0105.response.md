Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `n` + 1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, and an error has occurred because stdin contains no input. If `a` is equal to 1, then `bx` is `max(x, -1)`. If `a` is equal to 2, then `ax` is an integer equal to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. Otherwise, `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing one element which is an integer.**

However, since an error has occurred because stdin contains no input, the code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` will not be executed. Therefore, the values of `a` and `x` will not be updated.

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state because the code cannot be executed due to the error. The values of `t`, `r`, `_`, `n`, `a`, and `x` remain the same, and the conditions for `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` are still valid.
