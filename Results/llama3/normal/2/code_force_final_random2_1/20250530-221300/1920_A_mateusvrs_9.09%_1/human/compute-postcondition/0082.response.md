To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in cx:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `cx`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `cx` has at least one more element. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first element of `cx`, and `cx` has at least one element `x`.

For the loop to execute again, `cx` must have at least two elements, and `i` must be the second element of `cx`.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than `n + 1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `cx` is a set containing at least two elements, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `bx` is less than `ax`, `i` is the second element of `cx`. If the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.**
