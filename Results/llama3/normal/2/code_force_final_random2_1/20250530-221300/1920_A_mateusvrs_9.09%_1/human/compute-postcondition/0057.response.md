Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than `n + 1`, `r` is a list containing one element, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing one element `x`, `a` is an integer not equal to 1, `x` is an integer, stdin contains no input. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. Otherwise, `ax` is 1000000007.***
