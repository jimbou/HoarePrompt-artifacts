The only object in the loop head is variable  i and set cx, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set cx.  If the set has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, cx has at least 1 element, i is an element in the set cx. So for the loop to be executed one more time the set must have at least 2 elements and the i is another element in the set cx.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than `n` + 1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is an integer, `bx` is an integer, `cx` is a set that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, and an error has occurred because stdin contains no input. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `bx`. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is either `x` or `ax` whichever is smaller. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, then `cx` contains the value of `x`. Additionally, `bx` is less than `ax`, and `i` is an element in `cx`. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), then `tmp` is set to 1 and `i` is within this range. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.**
