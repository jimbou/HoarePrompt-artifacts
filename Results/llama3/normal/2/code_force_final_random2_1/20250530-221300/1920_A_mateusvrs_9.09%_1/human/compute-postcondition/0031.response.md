Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing all `x` values where `a` is neither 1 nor 2, and stdin contains no more input. Additionally, `bx` is less than `ax`.***
