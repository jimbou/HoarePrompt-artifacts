Postcondition: ***low is less than or equal to high, mid is the average of low and high, profit_mid is the result of func_1(mid, n, a, b), profit_next is the result of func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b), max_profit is the maximum of its original value and profit_mid, n, a, and b are positive integers. If profit_next is greater than profit_mid, then low is updated to be the average of the original low and high plus 1. Otherwise, high is updated to be mid - 1.***
