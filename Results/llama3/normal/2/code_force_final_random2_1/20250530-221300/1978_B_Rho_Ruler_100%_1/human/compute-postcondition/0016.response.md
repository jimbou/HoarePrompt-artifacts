Output State: **low is less than or equal to high, mid is the average of low and high, profit_mid is the result of func_1(mid, n, a, b), profit_next is the result of func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b), max_profit is the maximum of its original value and profit_mid, n, a, and b are positive integers, high is mid - 1**

In this output state, the value of high has been updated to mid - 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between low and high is still maintained, with low being less than or equal to high. The values of mid, profit_mid, profit_next, max_profit, n, a, and b remain the same as in the initial state.
