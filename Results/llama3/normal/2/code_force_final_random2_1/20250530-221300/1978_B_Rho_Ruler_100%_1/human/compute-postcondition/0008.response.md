To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `low` and `high` so that `low` is less than or equal to `high`.

According to the code, in each iteration, `low` is updated to the average of the original `low` and `high` plus 1 if `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, and `high` is updated to the average of `low` and `high` minus 1 otherwise. This means that `low` is always increasing and `high` is always decreasing.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `low` is still less than or equal to `high`. Since `low` is increasing and `high` is decreasing, we need to make sure that `low` is not greater than `high`.

State: **n, a, and b are positive integers. low is less than or equal to high**
