Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n, a, and b are positive integers, low is 0, high is the minimum of n and b, and max_profit is 0.
Code of the loop:
while low <= high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)
    profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)
    max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
    if profit_next > profit_mid:
        low = mid + 1
    else:
        high = mid - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n, a, and b are positive integers. The values of low, high, mid, profit_mid, profit_next, and max_profit are updated based on the comparison between profit_next and profit_mid. If profit_next is greater than profit_mid, low is updated to the average of the original low and high plus 1. Otherwise, high is updated to the average of low and high minus 1. In both cases, mid remains the average of the original low and high, profit_mid is the result of func_1(mid, n, a, b), profit_next is the result of func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b), and max_profit is the maximum of the original max_profit and profit_mid.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *n, a, and b are positive integers. low and high are updated based on the comparison of profit_next and profit_mid. If profit_next is greater than profit_mid, low is set to mid + 1 and high remains unchanged. Otherwise, low remains less than mid and high is set to mid - 1. In both cases, max_profit is the maximum of its original value and profit_mid.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *low is less than or equal to high, mid is the average of low and high, profit_mid is the result of func_1(mid, n, a, b), profit_next is the result of func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b), max_profit is the maximum of its original value and profit_mid, n, a, and b are positive integers. If profit_next is greater than profit_mid, then low is updated to be the average of the original low and high plus 1. Otherwise, high is updated to be mid - 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
