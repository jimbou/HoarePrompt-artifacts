Output State: **n, a, and b are positive integers. low is equal to mid + 1, mid is the integer average of low and high, profit_mid and profit_next are the results of func_1 with mid and mid + 1 as the first argument respectively, max_profit is the maximum of its original value and profit_mid, high remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of low has been updated to mid + 1, while the values of n, a, b, mid, profit_mid, profit_next, max_profit, and high remain unchanged. The relationship between mid and the average of low and high is still valid, but now low is equal to mid + 1.
