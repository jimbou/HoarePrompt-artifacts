Postcondition: ***n, a, and b are positive integers. The values of low, high, mid, profit_mid, profit_next, and max_profit are updated based on the comparison between profit_next and profit_mid. If profit_next is greater than profit_mid, low is updated to the average of the original low and high plus 1. Otherwise, high is updated to the average of low and high minus 1. In both cases, mid remains the average of the original low and high, profit_mid is the result of func_1(mid, n, a, b), profit_next is the result of func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b), and max_profit is the maximum of the original max_profit and profit_mid.***
