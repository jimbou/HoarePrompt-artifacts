Reasoning: 

The problem requires determining the maximum profit that Bob can obtain by selling all n buns, considering the promotion where the first k buns are sold at a modified price and the remaining (n - k) buns are sold at the usual price.

Function 1 (`func_1`) calculates the profit based on the input parameters k, n, a, and b. It correctly implements the formula for the profit, taking into account the modified price for the first k buns and the usual price for the remaining buns.

Function 2 (`func_2`) uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value of k that maximizes the profit. It iteratively narrows down the search range until it finds the optimal value, at which point it returns the maximum profit. The function correctly uses Function 1 to calculate the profit for each mid value and updates the maximum profit accordingly.

The main program reads the input, calls Function 2 for each test case, and prints the maximum profit.

Based on the execution summaries, both functions seem to be working correctly. Function 1 correctly calculates the profit, and Function 2 correctly finds the optimal value of k that maximizes the profit using a binary search approach.

Correctness: **True**
