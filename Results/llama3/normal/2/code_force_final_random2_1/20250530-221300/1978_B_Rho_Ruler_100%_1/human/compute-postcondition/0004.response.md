Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `low` is the average of the original `low` and `high` plus 1, `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`, `mid` is the average of the original `low` and `high`, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, and `max_profit` is the maximum of the original `max_profit` and `profit_mid`. The current value of `profit_next` is higher than the current value of `profit_mid`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain the same. The value of `low` is updated to be the average of the original `low` and `high` plus 1. The values of `high`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, `profit_next`, and `max_profit` remain the same. The relationship between `profit_next` and `profit_mid` remains the same, with `profit_next` being higher than `profit_mid`.
