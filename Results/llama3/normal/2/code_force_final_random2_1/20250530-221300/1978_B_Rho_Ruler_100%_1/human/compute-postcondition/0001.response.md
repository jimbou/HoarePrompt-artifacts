To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `low <= high`.

Given the initial states:

- `n`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers.
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`.
- `max_profit` is 0.

The loop condition `low <= high` will always be true because `low` is 0, which is the smallest possible value, and `high` is the minimum of two positive integers, making it also positive. Therefore, `low` (being 0) will always be less than or equal to `high` (being a positive integer).

Since the condition for the loop to execute is inherently satisfied by the given initial states, no adjustments are needed to the states of `low` and `high` for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `low` is 0, `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`, and `max_profit` is 0.**
