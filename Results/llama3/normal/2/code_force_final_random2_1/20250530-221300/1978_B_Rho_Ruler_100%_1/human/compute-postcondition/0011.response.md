Output State: **n, a, and b are positive integers. low is less than mid, mid is the integer average of low and high, profit_mid and profit_next are the results of func_1 with mid and mid + 1 as the first argument respectively, max_profit is the maximum of its original value and profit_mid, high is mid - 1.**

In this output state, the values of n, a, and b remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The relationship between low and mid changes to low being less than mid, as high is updated to mid - 1. The values of mid, profit_mid, profit_next, and max_profit remain the same as they are not directly affected by the update of high.
