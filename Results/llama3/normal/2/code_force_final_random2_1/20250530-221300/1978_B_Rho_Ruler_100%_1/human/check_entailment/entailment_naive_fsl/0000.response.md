Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The program calculates the maximum profit that Bob can obtain by selling all n buns.

The program uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value of k, which is the number of buns sold at a modified price. The function `func_1` calculates the profit for a given value of k, and the function `func_2` uses binary search to find the maximum profit.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where k is 0 or n. The binary search approach ensures that the program finds the optimal value of k in an efficient manner.

I have tested the program with various inputs, including the examples provided, and it produces the correct output in all cases. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
