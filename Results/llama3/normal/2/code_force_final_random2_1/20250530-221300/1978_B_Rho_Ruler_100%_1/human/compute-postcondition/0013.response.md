The only variables in the loop head are `low` and `high`, so we can only adjust those two.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the relationship between `low` and `high`. If `low` is less than or equal to `high`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `low` and `high` are updated based on the comparison of `profit_next` and `profit_mid`, but we don't know the exact values of `low` and `high`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the relationship between `low` and `high` so that `low` is still less than or equal to `high`. Since we don't know the exact values, we can't adjust the values of `low` and `high` themselves. However, we can adjust the relationship between them.

State: **n, a, and b are positive integers. low and high are updated based on the comparison of profit_next and profit_mid. If profit_next is greater than profit_mid, low is set to mid + 1 and high remains unchanged. Otherwise, low remains less than mid and high is set to mid - 1. In both cases, max_profit is the maximum of its original value and profit_mid. low must be less than or equal to high**
