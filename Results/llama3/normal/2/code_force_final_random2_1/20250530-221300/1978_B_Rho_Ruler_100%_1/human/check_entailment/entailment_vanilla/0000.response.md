Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum profit that Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The profit is calculated based on the number of buns sold at the modified price and the number of buns sold at the usual price.

Function 1, `func_1(k, n, a, b)`, calculates the profit for a given value of k. It correctly calculates the profit for the first k buns sold at the modified price and the remaining (n - k) buns sold at the usual price.

Function 2, `func_2(n, a, b)`, uses a binary search approach to find the maximum profit. It maintains a range [low, high] and iteratively checks the profit at the mid point of the range. If the profit at the next point is higher, it updates the low end of the range; otherwise, it updates the high end of the range. This process continues until the range is empty, at which point it returns the maximum profit found.

The binary search approach is correct because the profit function is unimodal, meaning that it first increases and then decreases as k increases. This is because the modified price decreases as k increases, but the number of buns sold at the modified price increases. The binary search approach takes advantage of this unimodality to efficiently find the maximum profit.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where k is 0 or n, and it correctly calculates the maximum profit for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
