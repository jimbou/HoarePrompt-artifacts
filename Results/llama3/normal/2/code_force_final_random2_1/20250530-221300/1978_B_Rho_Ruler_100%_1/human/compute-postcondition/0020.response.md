Functionality: **This function calculates the maximum profit that can be achieved by finding the optimal value of a variable within a given range, using a binary search approach. It takes four positive integers as input: n, a, and b, and returns the maximum profit that can be obtained. The function iteratively narrows down the search range until it finds the optimal value, at which point it returns the maximum profit. The function does not modify the input variables n, a, and b.**
