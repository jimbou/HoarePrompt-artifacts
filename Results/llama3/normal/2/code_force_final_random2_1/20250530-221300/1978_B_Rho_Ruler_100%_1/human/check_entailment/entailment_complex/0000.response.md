Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum profit that Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` calculates the profit for a given value of k, which is the number of buns sold at a modified price. The function takes four parameters: k, n, a, and b, and returns the calculated profit.

`func_2` uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value of k that maximizes the profit. It takes three parameters: n, a, and b, and returns the maximum profit.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the problem description. The calculation of profit in `func_1` is correct, and the binary search approach in `func_2` is a valid method for finding the optimal value of k.

The program also handles the edge cases correctly. For example, when k is 0, the program sells all buns at the usual price, which is the correct behavior.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is:

Correctness: **True**
