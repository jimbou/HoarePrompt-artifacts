Output State: **n, a, and b are positive integers. low is less than or equal to high, mid is the integer average of low and high, profit_mid and profit_next are the results of func_1 with mid and mid + 1 as the first argument respectively, max_profit is the maximum of its original value and profit_mid.**

This output state reflects the combined effect of all lines in the code snippet. The first line calculates the integer average of `low` and `high` and assigns it to `mid`. The second and third lines call `func_1` with `mid` and `mid + 1` as the first argument, respectively, and assign the results to `profit_mid` and `profit_next`. The fourth line updates `max_profit` to be the maximum of its original value and `profit_mid`. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged.
