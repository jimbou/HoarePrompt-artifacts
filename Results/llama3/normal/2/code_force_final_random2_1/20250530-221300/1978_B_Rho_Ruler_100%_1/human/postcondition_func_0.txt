Calculates a value based on the input parameters k, n, a, and b, where k is an integer between 0 and the minimum of n and b, n is a non-negative integer, a is a positive integer, and b is a positive integer. The calculation involves the product of k and b, minus the product of k and the integer division of (k-1) by 2, plus the product of (n-k) and a. The function returns this calculated value.
