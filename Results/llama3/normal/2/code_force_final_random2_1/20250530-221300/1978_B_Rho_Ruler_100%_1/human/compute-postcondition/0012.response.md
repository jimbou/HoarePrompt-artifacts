Postcondition: ***n, a, and b are positive integers. low and high are updated based on the comparison of profit_next and profit_mid. If profit_next is greater than profit_mid, low is set to mid + 1 and high remains unchanged. Otherwise, low remains less than mid and high is set to mid - 1. In both cases, max_profit is the maximum of its original value and profit_mid.***
