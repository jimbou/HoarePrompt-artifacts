#State of the program right berfore the function call: k, n, a, and b are integers such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), n >= 0, a > 0, and b > 0.
    return k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a
    #The program returns a value that is a result of the calculation involving the product of k and b, minus the product of k and the integer division of (k-1) by 2, plus the product of (n-k) and a, where k is an integer between 0 and the minimum of n and b, n is a non-negative integer, a is a positive integer, and b is a positive integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates a value based on the input parameters k, n, a, and b, where k is an integer between 0 and the minimum of n and b, n is a non-negative integer, a is a positive integer, and b is a positive integer. The calculation involves the product of k and b, minus the product of k and the integer division of (k-1) by 2, plus the product of (n-k) and a. The function returns this calculated value.

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)

        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
        
        if profit_next > profit_mid:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State: low is equal to high, mid is the average of low and high, profit_mid is the result of func_1(mid, n, a, b), profit_next is the result of func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b), max_profit is the maximum of its original value and profit_mid, n, a, and b are positive integers.
    return max_profit
    #The program returns max_profit which is the maximum of its original value and profit_mid, where profit_mid is the result of func_1(mid, n, a, b) and mid is the average of low and high, and low is equal to high, and n, a, and b are positive integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the maximum profit that can be achieved by finding the optimal value of a variable within a given range, using a binary search approach. It takes four positive integers as input: n, a, and b, and returns the maximum profit that can be obtained. The function iteratively narrows down the search range until it finds the optimal value, at which point it returns the maximum profit. The function does not modify the input variables n, a, and b.
