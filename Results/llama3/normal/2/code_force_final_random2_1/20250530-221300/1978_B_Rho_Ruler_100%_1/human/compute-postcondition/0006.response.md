Output State: **n, a, and b are positive integers, low is 0, high is the average of low and high minus 1, mid is the average of low and high, profit_mid is the result of func_1(mid, n, a, b), profit_next is the result of func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b), and max_profit is the maximum of the original max_profit and profit_mid. Additionally, profit_next is less than or equal to profit_mid.**

In this output state, the value of high has been updated to be the average of low and high minus 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the relationships between them are still valid.
