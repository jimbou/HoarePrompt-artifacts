Output State: **`case` is a list of two elements, the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string of length equal to the first element, containing only 'U' and 'D' characters, `ups` is the number of 'U' characters in the second element of `case`.**

In this output state, the value of `ups` is calculated by counting the number of 'U' characters in the second element of the `case` list. The value of `case` remains unchanged, with the first element being a positive integer and the second element being a string of length equal to the first element, containing only 'U' and 'D' characters.
