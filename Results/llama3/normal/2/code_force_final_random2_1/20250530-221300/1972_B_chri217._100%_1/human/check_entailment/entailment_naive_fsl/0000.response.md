Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine who will win the game if they both play optimally. The function `func_2` only checks if the number of 'U's is odd or even, but this is not sufficient to determine the winner of the game.

A counterexample is when the input is `n = 4` and `s = "UUDD"`. In this case, the function `func_2` will return 'NO', but Alice can actually win the game by choosing the first 'U' coin, flipping the adjacent coins, and then choosing the remaining 'U' coin.

The correct solution should take into account the arrangement of the 'U' and 'D' coins, not just the count of 'U' coins. The program does not handle this correctly, therefore it is incorrect.
