Output State: **t is a positive integer, cases is a list of t pairs where each pair contains a positive integer n and a string s of length n consisting only of "U" and "D", _ is t-1, stdin is empty**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable 't' remains a positive integer, the list 'cases' will contain 't' pairs of values, where each pair consists of a positive integer 'n' and a string 's' of length 'n' containing only the characters "U" and "D". The variable '_' will have a value of 't-1', indicating that the loop has executed 't' times. Finally, the standard input 'stdin' will be empty, as all input data has been read and processed by the loop.
