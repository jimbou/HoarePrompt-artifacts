Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, cases is a list of t+2 pairs where each pair contains a positive integer n and a string s of length n consisting only of "U" and "D", _ is 2, stdin is empty**

The code reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from stdin, and appends a tuple `(n, s)` to the list `cases`. Since `t` is a positive integer greater than 2, and `cases` initially contains `t+1` pairs, after the code executes, `cases` will contain `t+2` pairs. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 2, and stdin becomes empty after reading the input.
