This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function then processes these integers to form two lists, ans1 and ans2, based on certain conditions. It prints these two lists for each test case. The function appears to be solving a specific problem, possibly related to arranging numbers in a particular order, but the exact purpose is not immediately clear from the code alone.
