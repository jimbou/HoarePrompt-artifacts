Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing either 2n or 2n - 2 instances of the largest integer in b, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is 1, ans2 is a list containing two instances of the current value of c[i], k is an integer equal to k - 2.**

The code appends the current value of `c[i]` to `ans2` twice, effectively adding two instances of the same value to `ans2`. Since `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, both appended values are the same. The value of `k` is then decremented by 2. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.
