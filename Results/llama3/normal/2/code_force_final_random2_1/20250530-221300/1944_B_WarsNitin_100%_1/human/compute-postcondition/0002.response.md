Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, l is an empty list.**

The code reads two lines from stdin for each test case, reducing the number of test cases by 1. It assigns the first integer to `n` and the second integer to `k`, then reads 2n integers into `a`. The first n integers are assigned to `b` and the second n integers are assigned to `c`. Both `b` and `c` are sorted in ascending order. The value of `k` is doubled and assigned to `req`. The lists `ans1`, `ans2`, and `l` are initialized as empty lists. The values of `t` and `q` remain unchanged.
