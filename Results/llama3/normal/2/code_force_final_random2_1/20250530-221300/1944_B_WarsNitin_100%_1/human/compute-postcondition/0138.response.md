Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing either 2n or 2n - 2 instances of the largest integer in b and one more instance of l[i], req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is 2, ans2 is a list containing 2 * floor(n / 2) instances of the integer at index n - 1 in c and one more instance of l[i], l is a list that must have at least 2 elements, and if k is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is terminated, otherwise, k remains k - 1.**
