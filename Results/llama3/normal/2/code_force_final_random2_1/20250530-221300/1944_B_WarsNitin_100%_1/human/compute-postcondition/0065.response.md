Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is -2, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the last element of b repeated twice, two copies of each b[i] where b[i] is equal to b[i - 1], and l[i], l[i], ans2 is a list containing two copies of each c[i] where c[i] is equal to c[i - 1] and l[i], l[i], req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, l is a list containing at least two elements, and i is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been decremented by 1, and `ans1` and `ans2` have each been appended with the value of `l[i]`. No other variables have been modified.
