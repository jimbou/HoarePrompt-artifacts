Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is n - 1, `k` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the largest integer in b, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive or the last element of b.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to be equal to `req`, which is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive. All other variables remain unchanged.
