Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is -2*len(l), a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, and i is -1. If the smallest two integers in b are different, then l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and the largest integer in b. Otherwise, k is -2*len(l) - 2, ans1 is a list containing two instances of the largest integer in b, and l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive.***
