Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing either 2n or 2n - 2 instances of the largest integer in b, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is 2, ans2 is a list containing two instances of the integer at index 2 in c, k is an integer equal to k - 2.**

The code appends two instances of the integer at index 2 in list c to list ans2, decrements k by 2, and does not modify any other variables.
