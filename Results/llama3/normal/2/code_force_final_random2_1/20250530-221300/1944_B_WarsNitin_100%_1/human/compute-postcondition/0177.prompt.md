Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *t is a positive integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is k, k is either 0 or -2, if b[0] is not equal to b[1], then l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive. If b[n - 2] is not equal to b[n - 1], then l contains the last element of b. Otherwise, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the largest integer in b and ans2 is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
        l.append(b[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is 1. If b[i] is equal to b[i - 1], then k is an integer less than or equal to -2, ans1 is a list containing four copies of the largest integer in b, ans2 is an empty list, and l is either a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive or a list containing the last element of b. If b[i] is not equal to b[i - 1], then if b[i] is not equal to b[i + 1], l contains b[i]. If b[0] is not equal to b[1], then l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and b[i]. If b[n - 2] is not equal to b[n - 1], then l contains the last element of b and b[i]. Otherwise, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the largest integer in b and ans2 is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is 2. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is an integer equal to `k - 2`, and `ans1` is a list with two additional elements equal to `b[i]`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `l` is a list that includes the third element of `b` (which is an integer between 1 and n inclusive). If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is 3. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is a list with two additional elements equal to `b[3]`, and `k` is reduced by 2. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `l` is a list containing the 4th element of `b`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
