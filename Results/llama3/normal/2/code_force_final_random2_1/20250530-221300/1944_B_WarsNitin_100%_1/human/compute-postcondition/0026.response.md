Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer at least 3 and at most 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is either 0 or an even integer between 0 and n inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing two copies of the last element of `b` repeated twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `l` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, `b[i]`, and `b[n - 1]`, and `i` is 2. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the last element of `b` repeated twice. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `l` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, `b[i]`, and `b[n - 1]` if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `l`. The value of `b[i]` is the `i-th` element of the sorted list `b`, where `i` is 2. The list `l` now contains the smallest integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `b[i]`, and `b[n - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
