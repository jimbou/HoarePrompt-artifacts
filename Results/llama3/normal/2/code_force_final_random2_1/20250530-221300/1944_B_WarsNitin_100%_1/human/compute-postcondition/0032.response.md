Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer at least 4 and at most 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is either -2 or an even integer between -2 and n inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the last element of b repeated twice and two copies of b[i], ans2 is an empty list, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, l is either a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and b[n - 1] or a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and b[i] and b[n - 1], and i is 3. If b[i] is equal to b[i - 1], then ans1 is a list containing two copies of the last element of b repeated twice. If b[i] is not equal to b[i - 1], then l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, b[i], and b[n - 1] if b[i] is not equal to b[i + 1]. If k is -2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If b[i] is not equal to b[i + 1], then l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, b[i], and b[n - 1]. If k is -2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
