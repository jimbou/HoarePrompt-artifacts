Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is -2*len(l), `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is -1, and `l` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and the largest integer in `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to include the largest integer in `b`, which is `b[n - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `k` is still equal to -2 times the length of `l`, which has increased by 1.
