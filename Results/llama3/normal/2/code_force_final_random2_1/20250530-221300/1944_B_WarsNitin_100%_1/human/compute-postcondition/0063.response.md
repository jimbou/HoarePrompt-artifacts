Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is -1, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the last element of `b` repeated twice, two copies of each `b[i]` where `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, and `l[i]`, `ans2` is a list containing two copies of each `c[i]` where `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]` and `l[i]`, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `l` is a list containing at least two elements, and `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code only contains a break statement, which means it will exit the innermost loop or if statement it is currently in. The values of all variables remain the same, but the program will no longer be inside the loop or if statement it was in.
