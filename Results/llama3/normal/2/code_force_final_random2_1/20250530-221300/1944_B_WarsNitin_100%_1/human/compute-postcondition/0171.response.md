Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `t`, `q`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `req` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is still 3. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1.
