Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing four instances of the largest integer in b, ans2 is an empty list, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is 1, k is an integer two less than its original value.**

The code block appends the value of `b[i]` to `ans1` twice, effectively adding two more instances of the largest integer in `b` to `ans1`. Since `i` is 1 and `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, both appended values are the same. The value of `k` is decreased by 2. No other variables are affected by the code block.
