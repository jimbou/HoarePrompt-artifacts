Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is 2, `l` is a list that includes the third element of `b` (which is an integer between 1 and n inclusive), if `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to include the third element of `b`, which is an integer between 1 and n inclusive. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
