Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the last element of `b` repeated twice and two copies of each `b[i]` where `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is an even integer between 2 and `n` inclusive, `l` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and `n` inclusive and `b[i]` and `b[n - 1]` for all `i` where `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, and `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
