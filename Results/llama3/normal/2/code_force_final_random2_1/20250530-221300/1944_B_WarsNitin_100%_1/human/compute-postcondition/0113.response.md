Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` is a list containing either 2n or 2n - 2 instances of the largest integer in b, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is 1. The current value of `c[i]` is equal to the current value of `c[i - 1]`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
