Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is 1, `k` is 0, if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, then `l` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive. If `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`, then `l` contains the last element of `b`. Otherwise, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the largest integer in `b` and `ans2` is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `t`, `q`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, `i`, and `k` remain the same, and the conditions for `l`, `ans1`, and `ans2` also remain the same. The only change is that we exit the current loop or if statement.
