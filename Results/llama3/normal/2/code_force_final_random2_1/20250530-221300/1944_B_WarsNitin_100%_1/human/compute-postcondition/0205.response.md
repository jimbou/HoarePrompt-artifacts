Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer greater than 1 and between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is 1, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the largest integer in b and l[i] and an additional element l[i], ans2 is a list containing two copies of c[i] if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], otherwise ans2 is a list containing two copies of c[i] and l[i] and an additional element l[i], k is k - 1.**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables `ans1`, `ans2`, and `k`. The first line appends the value of `l[i]` to the list `ans1`, effectively adding a new element to the list. The second line does the same for the list `ans2`. The third line decrements the value of `k` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
