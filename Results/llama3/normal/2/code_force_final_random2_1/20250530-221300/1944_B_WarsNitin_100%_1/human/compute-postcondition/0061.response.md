Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is -1, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the last element of b repeated twice, two copies of each b[i] where b[i] is equal to b[i - 1], and l[i], ans2 is a list containing two copies of each c[i] where c[i] is equal to c[i - 1] and l[i], req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, l is a list containing at least one element, and i is 0.**

The code appends the value of `l[i]` to both `ans1` and `ans2`, and then decrements `k` by 1. Since `k` was initially 0, it becomes -1. The values of `t`, `q`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `l` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains 0, as it is not modified by the code. The lists `ans1` and `ans2` are updated by appending the value of `l[i]` to them.
