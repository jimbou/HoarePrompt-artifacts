Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` is a list containing two instances of the largest integer in `b`, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is 1. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
