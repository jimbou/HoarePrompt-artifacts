Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is -2*len(l), a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, l is an empty list, and i is -1**

The code reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `k`. It then reads a list of 2n integers from stdin and assigns it to `a`. The first n elements of `a` are assigned to `b`, and the remaining elements are assigned to `c`. Both `b` and `c` are sorted in ascending order. The value of `k` is multiplied by 2, and `req` is set to this new value of `k`. Two empty lists `ans1` and `ans2` are created, and an empty list `l` is also created. The value of `i` is set to -1.
