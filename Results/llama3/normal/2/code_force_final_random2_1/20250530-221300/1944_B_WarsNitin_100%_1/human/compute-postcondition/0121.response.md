To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, we can increment `i` by 1 to make it 3.

State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing either 2n or 2n - 2 instances of the largest integer in b, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is 3, ans2 is a list containing two instances of the integer at index 2 in c, k is an integer equal to k - 2**
