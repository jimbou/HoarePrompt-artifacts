Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is 0, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the last element of b repeated twice and two copies of each b[i] where b[i] is equal to b[i - 1], ans2 is a list containing two copies of each c[i] where c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and b[i] and b[n - 1] for all i where b[i] is not equal to b[i + 1], and i is n - 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    if k == 0:
        break
    ans1.append(l[i])
    ans2.append(l[i])
    k -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is -1, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the last element of b repeated twice, two copies of each b[i] where b[i] is equal to b[i - 1], and l[i], ans2 is a list containing two copies of each c[i] where c[i] is equal to c[i - 1] and l[i], req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, l is a list containing at least one element, and i is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is -2, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the last element of b repeated twice, two copies of each b[i] where b[i] is equal to b[i - 1], and l[i], l[i], ans2 is a list containing two copies of each c[i] where c[i] is equal to c[i - 1] and l[i], l[i], req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, l is a list containing at least two elements, and i is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is -3, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the last element of b repeated twice, two copies of each b[i] where b[i] is equal to b[i - 1], and l[i], l[i], l[i], ans2 is a list containing two copies of each c[i] where c[i] is equal to c[i - 1] and l[i], l[i], l[i], req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, l is a list containing at least three elements, and i is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
