Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is `k`, `k` is 0, if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, then `l` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and the last element of `b`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing the last element of `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated by appending the last element of `b` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. If `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, then `l` contains the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and the last element of `b`. Otherwise, `l` contains only the last element of `b`.
