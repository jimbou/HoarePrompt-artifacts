Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is 3, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the largest integer in b, `l` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive or the last element of b. If `k` is 0, then `ans2` is a list containing four copies of `c[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, nothing changes.***
