Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an even integer between 2 and `n` inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and `n` inclusive where the first two elements are not equal, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is an even integer between 2 and `n` inclusive, `l` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and `n` inclusive.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to contain the smallest integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, which is the first element of the sorted list `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
