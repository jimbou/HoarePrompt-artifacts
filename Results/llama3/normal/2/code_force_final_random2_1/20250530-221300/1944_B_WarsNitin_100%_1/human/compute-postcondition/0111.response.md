Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` is a list containing either 2n or 2n - 2 instances of the largest integer in b, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is 1, and `k` is 0. If the smallest two integers in b are different, then l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and the largest integer in b. Otherwise, ans1 is a list containing two instances of the largest integer in b, and l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on the variables are still valid. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
