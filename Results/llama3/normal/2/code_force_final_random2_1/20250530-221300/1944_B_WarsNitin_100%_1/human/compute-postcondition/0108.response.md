Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing either 2n or 2n - 2 instances of the largest integer in b, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is n - 1, and k is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive. If the smallest two integers in b are different, then l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and the largest integer in b. Otherwise, ans1 is a list containing two instances of the largest integer in b, and l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive.**

In this output state, the value of k has been updated to be equal to req, which is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive. All other variables remain unchanged.
