The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list l, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and list `l`. If `i` is less than `len(l)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `len(l)` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `len(l)` must be greater than 2.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer greater than 1 and between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is 2, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the largest integer in b and l[i] and an additional element l[i], ans2 is a list containing two copies of c[i] if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], otherwise ans2 is a list containing two copies of c[i] and l[i] and an additional element l[i], k is k - 1, l is a list of at least 3 integers**
