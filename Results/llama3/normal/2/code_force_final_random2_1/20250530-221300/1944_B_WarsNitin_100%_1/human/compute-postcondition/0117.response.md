Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` is a list containing either 2n or 2n - 2 instances of the largest integer in b, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2, and all other variables maintain their initial values and properties.
