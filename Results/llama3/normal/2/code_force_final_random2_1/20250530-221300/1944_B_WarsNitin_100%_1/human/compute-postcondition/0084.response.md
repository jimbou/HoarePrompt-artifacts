Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` is a list containing two instances of the largest integer in `b`, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
