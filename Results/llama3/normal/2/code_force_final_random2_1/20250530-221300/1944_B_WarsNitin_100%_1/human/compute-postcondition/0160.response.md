Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is 1, if `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise, no changes are made. If `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, then `l` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and `b[i]`. If `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`, then `l` contains the last element of `b` and `b[i]`. Otherwise, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the largest integer in `b` and `ans2` is an empty list. Additionally, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`. The current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that the list `l` now contains an additional element, which is the current value of `b[i]`. This is because the code `l.append(b[i])` adds the current value of `b[i]` to the end of the list `l`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
