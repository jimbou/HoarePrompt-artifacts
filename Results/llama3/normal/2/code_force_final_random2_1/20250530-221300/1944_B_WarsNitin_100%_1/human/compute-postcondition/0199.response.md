Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is 0, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the largest integer in b, `ans2` is a list containing two copies of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` is an empty list, `l` must have at least 1 element, and the current value of `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
