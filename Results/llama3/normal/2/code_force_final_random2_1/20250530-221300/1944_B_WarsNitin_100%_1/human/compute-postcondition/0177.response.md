Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is n - 1, k is 0, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the largest integer in b, ans2 is an empty list, l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive or the last element of b.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the exception of the variables in the loop head and body. The loop iterates from 1 to n-1, and in each iteration, it checks if k is 0. If k is 0, the loop breaks. If b[i] is equal to b[i-1], ans1 is appended with two copies of b[i] and k is reduced by 2. If b[i] is not equal to b[i-1] and b[i] is not equal to b[i+1], l is appended with b[i]. After the loop finishes executing, i is n-1, k is 0, ans1 contains two copies of the largest integer in b, ans2 is an empty list, and l contains the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive or the last element of b.
