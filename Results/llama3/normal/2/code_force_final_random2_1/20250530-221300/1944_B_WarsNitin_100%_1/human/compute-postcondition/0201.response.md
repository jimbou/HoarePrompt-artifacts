Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer greater than 1 and between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is 0, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the largest integer in b and l[i], ans2 is a list containing two copies of c[i] if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], otherwise ans2 is a list containing two copies of c[i] and l[i], k is k - 1.**

The code adds the value of `l[i]` to both `ans1` and `ans2`, and decrements `k` by 1. The value of `l[i]` is not specified in the initial state, so it is included in the output state as is. The values of `t`, `q`, `n`, `a`, `c`, `req`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `k` is decremented by 1, but its new value is not specified, so it is included in the output state as `k - 1`.
