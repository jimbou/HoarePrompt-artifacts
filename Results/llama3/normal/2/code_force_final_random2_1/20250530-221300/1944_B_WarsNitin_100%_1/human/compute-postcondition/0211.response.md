The code prints the elements of the list `ans1`. Based on the precondition, `ans1` is a list containing `len(l)` copies of the largest integer in `b` and `l[i]`. Since `l[i]` is the last element of the list `l` (because `i` is `len(l) - 1`), `ans1` contains `len(l)` copies of the largest integer in `b` and the last element of `l`.

Output: **the largest integer in b and the last element of l repeated len(l) times**
