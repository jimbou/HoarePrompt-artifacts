To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 2 to satisfy the loop condition.

State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is 2**
