Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing either 2n or 2n - 2 instances of the largest integer in b, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is n - 1, and k is 0. If the smallest two integers in b are different, then l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and the largest integer in b. Otherwise, ans1 is a list containing two instances of the largest integer in b, and l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

The loop iterates from 1 to n-1, where n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive. The loop body checks if k is 0, and if so, it breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it checks if the current element in list b is equal to the previous element. If they are equal, it appends the current element to list ans1 twice and decrements k by 2. If they are not equal, it appends the current element to list l.

After the loop finishes executing, the output state is as follows:

* t is still a positive integer greater than 1.
* q is still 1.
* stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2.
* n is still an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive.
* a is still a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive.
* b is still a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive.
* c is still a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive.
* ans1 is a list containing either 2n or 2n - 2 instances of the largest integer in b.
* req is still an even integer between 2 and n inclusive.
* i is now n - 1.
* k is now 0.

If the smallest two integers in b are different, then l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and the largest integer in b. Otherwise, ans1 is a list containing two instances of the largest integer in b, and l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive.
