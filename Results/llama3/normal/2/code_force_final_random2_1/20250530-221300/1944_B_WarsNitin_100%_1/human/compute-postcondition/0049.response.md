Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an even integer between 0 and n - 2 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the last element of b repeated twice and two copies of each b[i] where b[i] is equal to b[i - 1], ans2 is a list containing two copies of c[i] if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], otherwise ans2 is an empty list, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and b[i] and b[n - 1] for all i where b[i] is not equal to b[i + 1], i is 2, and c[i] has been appended to ans2 twice and k has been decremented by 2.**

The code appends `c[i]` to `ans2` twice and decrements `k` by 2. The value of `k` is now an even integer between 0 and `n - 2` inclusive. The value of `c[i]` has been appended to `ans2` twice. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
