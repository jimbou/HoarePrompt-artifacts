Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer greater than 1 and between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is 1, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the largest integer in b, ans2 is a list containing two copies of c[i], l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive or the last element of b, k is an integer less than or equal to the previous value of k minus 2.**

In this output state, the value of `ans2` has been updated to include two copies of `c[i]`, which is the current value of `c[i]`. The value of `k` has been decremented by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
