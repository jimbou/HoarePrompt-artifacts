Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is `k`, `k` is 0, `l` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `q`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `req`, `i`, `k` and `n` remains the same as in the initial state. The value of `l` is updated to contain the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, which is the first element of the sorted list `b`.
