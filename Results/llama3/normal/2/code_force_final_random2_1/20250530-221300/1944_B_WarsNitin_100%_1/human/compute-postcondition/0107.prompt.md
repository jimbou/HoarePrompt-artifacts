Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is -2*len(l), a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, and i is -1. If the smallest two integers in b are different, then l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and the largest integer in b. Otherwise, k is -2*len(l) - 2, ans1 is a list containing two instances of the largest integer in b, and l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
        l.append(b[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, `ans1` is a list containing four instances of the largest integer in `b`, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is 1, and `k` is an integer two less than its original value. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, `ans1` is a list containing two instances of the largest integer in `b`, `ans2` is a list containing the value of `b[i]`, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is 1, and `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, `ans1` is a list containing six instances of the largest integer in `b`, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is 2, and `k` is an integer four less than its original value. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, `ans1` is a list containing four instances of the largest integer in `b`, `ans2` is a list containing the value of `b[i]`, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is 2, and `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, the program executes the if part, otherwise, it does nothing.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive. If b[i] is equal to b[i - 1], ans1 is a list containing either six or four instances of the largest integer in b plus two instances of b[i], req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is 3, k is an integer two less than its original value, and l is a list containing the value of b[i] if b[i] is not equal to b[i - 1]. If b[i] is not equal to b[i - 1], ans1 is a list containing four instances of the largest integer in b, ans2 is a list containing the value of b[i], req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is 3, and l is a list containing the values of b[i] and the new value of b[i]. If k is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program does nothing. If b[i] is not equal to b[i + 1], l is a list containing the values of b[i] and the new value of b[i].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
