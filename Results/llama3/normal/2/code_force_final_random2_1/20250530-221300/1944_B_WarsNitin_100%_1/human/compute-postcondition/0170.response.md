The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is 3**
