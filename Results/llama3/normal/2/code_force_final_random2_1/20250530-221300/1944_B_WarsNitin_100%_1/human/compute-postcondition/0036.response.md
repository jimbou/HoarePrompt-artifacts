Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the last element of `b` repeated twice and two copies of each `b[i]` where `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is an even integer between 2 and `n` inclusive, `l` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and `n` inclusive and `b[i]` and `b[n - 1]` for all `i` where `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, and `i` is `n - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 0.
*   The value of `q` remains unchanged as 0.
*   The value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive.
*   The value of `k` is 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
*   The value of `a` remains unchanged as a list of 2n integers between 1 and `n` inclusive.
*   The value of `b` remains unchanged as a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive.
*   The value of `c` remains unchanged as a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive.
*   The value of `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the last element of `b` repeated twice and two copies of each `b[i]` where `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`.
*   The value of `ans2` remains unchanged as an empty list.
*   The value of `req` remains unchanged as an even integer between 2 and `n` inclusive.
*   The value of `l` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and `n` inclusive and `b[i]` and `b[n - 1]` for all `i` where `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`.
*   The value of `i` is `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
