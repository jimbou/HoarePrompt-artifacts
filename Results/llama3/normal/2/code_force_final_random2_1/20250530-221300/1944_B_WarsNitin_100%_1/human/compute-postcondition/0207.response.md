Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is 2, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the largest integer in b and l[i] and an additional element l[i], `ans2` is a list containing two copies of c[i] if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], otherwise ans2 is a list containing two copies of c[i] and l[i] and an additional element l[i], `k` is k - 1, `l` is a list of at least 3 integers and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
