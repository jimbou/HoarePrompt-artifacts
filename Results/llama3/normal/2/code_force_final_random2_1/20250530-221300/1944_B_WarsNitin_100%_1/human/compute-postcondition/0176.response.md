Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is 3. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is a list with two additional elements equal to `b[3]`, and `k` is reduced by 2. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `l` is a list containing the 4th element of `b`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
