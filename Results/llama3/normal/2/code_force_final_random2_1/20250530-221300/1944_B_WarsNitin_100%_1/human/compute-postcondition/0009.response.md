Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an even integer between 0 and n-2 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the last element of b, ans2 is an empty list, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, l is an empty list, the second last element of b is equal to the last element of b**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `q`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans2`, `req`, and `l` remain unchanged. The value of `k` is decremented by 2, making it an even integer between 0 and `n-2` inclusive. The list `ans1` now contains two copies of the last element of `b`, which is equal to the second last element of `b`.
