Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing either 2n or 2n - 2 instances of the largest integer in b, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is n - 1, ans2 is a list containing 2 * floor(n / 2) instances of the integer at index n - 1 in c, and k is 0.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variables i, ans2, and k. The variable i is now n - 1, indicating that the loop has iterated n - 1 times. The variable ans2 is a list containing 2 * floor(n / 2) instances of the integer at index n - 1 in c, where floor(n / 2) is the largest integer less than or equal to n / 2. This is because the loop appends two instances of the current value of c[i] to ans2 whenever c[i] equals c[i - 1], and this happens at most floor(n / 2) times. The variable k is now 0, indicating that the loop has terminated.
