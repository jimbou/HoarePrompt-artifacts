Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is k, k is 0, if b[0] is not equal to b[1], then l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive. Otherwise, l remains an empty list.***
