Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer at least 3 and at most 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is either 0 or an even integer between 0 and n inclusive and is 2 less than its original value, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is either a list containing two copies of the last element of b repeated twice or a list containing two copies of the last element of b repeated twice and two additional copies of b[i], ans2 is an empty list, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, l is either a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and b[n - 1] or a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and b[i] and b[n - 1], and i is 2. If b[i] is equal to b[i - 1], then ans1 is a list containing two copies of the last element of b repeated twice. If b[i] is not equal to b[i - 1], then l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and b[i] and b[n - 1] if b[i] is not equal to b[i + 1]. If k is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code adds two copies of the value of `b[i]` to `ans1` and decrements `k` by 2. The value of `k` is reduced by 2, and the list `ans1` now contains two additional copies of `b[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
