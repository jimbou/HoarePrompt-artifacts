Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is -2, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the last element of `b` repeated twice, two copies of each `b[i]` where `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, and `l[i]`, `l[i]`, `ans2` is a list containing two copies of each `c[i]` where `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]` and `l[i]`, `l[i]`, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `l` is a list containing at least three elements, and `i` is 2. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state.***
