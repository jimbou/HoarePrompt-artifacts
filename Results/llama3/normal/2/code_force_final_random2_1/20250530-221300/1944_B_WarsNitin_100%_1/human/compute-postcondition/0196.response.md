Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is n - 1, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the largest integer in b, `ans2` is a list containing two copies of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive or the last element of b, and `k` is 0.**

The loop will execute until `i` is equal to `n - 1`, at which point `i` will be out of range and the loop will terminate. At this point, `ans2` will contain two copies of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise it will be an empty list. The value of `k` will be 0, indicating that the loop has executed all its iterations. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
