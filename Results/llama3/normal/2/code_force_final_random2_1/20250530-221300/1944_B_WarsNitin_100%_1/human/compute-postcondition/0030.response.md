Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer at least 4 and at most 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is either 0 or an even integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing two copies of the last element of `b` repeated twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is an even integer between 2 and `n` inclusive, `l` is either a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and `n` inclusive and `b[n - 1]` or a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and `n` inclusive and `b[i]` and `b[n - 1]`, and `i` is 3. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the last element of `b` repeated twice. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `l` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `b[i]`, and `b[n - 1]` if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, then `l` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `b[i]`, and `b[n - 1]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the values of all variables remain the same, but the program execution is interrupted, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
