Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` is a list containing two instances of the largest integer in `b`, `ans2` is a list containing the value of `b[i]`, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is 1, `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i]`. The current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`. The current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `b[i]` has been appended to the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `b[i]` is still not equal to `b[i - 1]` and `b[i + 1]`, as the code only appends the value to the list `l` without modifying the original list `b`.
