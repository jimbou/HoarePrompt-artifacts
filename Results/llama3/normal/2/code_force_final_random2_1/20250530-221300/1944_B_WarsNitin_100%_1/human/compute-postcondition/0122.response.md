Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` is a list containing either 2n or 2n - 2 instances of the largest integer in b, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is 3, `ans2` is a list containing two instances of the integer at index 2 in c, `k` is an integer equal to k - 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
