Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer at least 3 and at most 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is either 0 or an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing two copies of the last element of `b`, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `l` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and `b[i]` and `b[n - 1]`, and `i` is 1. Additionally, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`. The current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still a positive integer greater than 0. The value of `q` is still 0. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1. The value of `n` is still an integer at least 3 and at most 5 * 10^4 inclusive. The value of `k` is still either 0 or an even integer between 2 and n inclusive. The list `a` still contains 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive. The list `b` is still a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive. The list `c` is still a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive. The list `ans1` is still either an empty list or a list containing two copies of the last element of `b`. The list `ans2` is still an empty list. The value of `req` is still an even integer between 2 and n inclusive. The list `l` now contains the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, `b[i]`, and `b[n - 1]`. The value of `i` is still 1. Additionally, `b[i]` is still not equal to `b[i - 1]`, and the current value of `b[i]` is still not equal to `b[i + 1]`.
