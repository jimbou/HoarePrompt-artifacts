Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer greater than 1 and between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is 2, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the largest integer in b, ans2 is a list containing four copies of c[i], l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive or the last element of b, k is k - 2.**

The code snippet modifies the state of `ans2` and `k`. The first two lines append two copies of `c[i]` to `ans2`, effectively doubling its length. Since `ans2` initially contained two copies of `c[i]` if `c[i]` was equal to `c[i - 1]`, or was an empty list otherwise, it now contains four copies of `c[i]`. The third line decrements `k` by 2.
