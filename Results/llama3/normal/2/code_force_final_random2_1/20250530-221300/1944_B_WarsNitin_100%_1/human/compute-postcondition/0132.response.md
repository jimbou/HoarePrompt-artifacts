The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list l, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and list `l`. If `i` is less than the length of list `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, list `l` must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again list `l` must have at least 2 elements.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` is a list containing either 2n or 2n - 2 instances of the largest integer in b, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is 1, `ans2` is a list containing 2 * floor(n / 2) instances of the integer at index n - 1 in c, `l` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `k` is k - 1, `ans1` has one more instance of l[i], `ans2` has one more instance of l[i]**
