Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive with the value at index i repeated twice in ans1, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is 2, k is an integer equal to k - 2, ans1 is a list with two additional elements equal to b[i].**

The code snippet appends the value of `b[i]` to `ans1` twice, effectively repeating the value at index `i` in `b` twice in `ans1`. The value of `k` is decremented by 2. No other variables are affected by the code snippet.
