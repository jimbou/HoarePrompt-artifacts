Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `ans2` is a list containing `len(l)` copies of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise it contains `len(l)` copies of `c[i]` and `l[i]` and an additional element `l[i]`.
* Since `i` is `len(l) - 1`, `c[i]` is the last element of the sorted list `c`, and `c[i - 1]` is the second last element of `c`.
* Since `c` is a sorted list, `c[i]` is greater than or equal to `c[i - 1]`.
* If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` contains `len(l)` copies of `c[i]`.
* Otherwise, `ans2` contains `len(l)` copies of `c[i]` and `l[i]` and an additional element `l[i]`.

Therefore, the `print(*ans2)` statement will print the elements of `ans2` separated by spaces.

Output: **[c[i] if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], otherwise c[i] and l[i] and an additional element l[i], repeated len(l) times]**
