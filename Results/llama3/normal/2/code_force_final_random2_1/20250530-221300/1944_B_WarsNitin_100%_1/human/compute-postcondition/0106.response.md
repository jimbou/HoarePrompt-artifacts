Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive. If b[i] is equal to b[i - 1], ans1 is a list containing either six or four instances of the largest integer in b plus two instances of b[i], req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is 3, k is an integer two less than its original value, and l is a list containing the value of b[i] if b[i] is not equal to b[i - 1]. If b[i] is not equal to b[i - 1], ans1 is a list containing four instances of the largest integer in b, ans2 is a list containing the value of b[i], req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is 3, and l is a list containing the values of b[i] and the new value of b[i]. If k is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program does nothing. If b[i] is not equal to b[i + 1], l is a list containing the values of b[i] and the new value of b[i].***
