State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `i` is 3, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the largest integer in b, `ans2` is a list containing two copies of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive or the last element of b, and either we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k` is 0, or nothing changes if `k` is not 0. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` is a list containing four copies of `c[i]`, `l` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive or the last element of b, and `k` is `k - 2`.**
