Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the largest integer in b, ans2 is an empty list, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is k, k is -2, if b[0] is not equal to b[1], then l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive. Otherwise, l remains an empty list.**

The code appends the largest integer in `b` (which is `b[n - 1]`) to `ans1` twice, effectively adding two copies of this value to `ans1`. The value of `k` is then decremented by 2, making it -2. All other variables remain unchanged.
