Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an even integer between 0 and n - 2 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the last element of b repeated twice and two copies of each b[i] where b[i] is equal to b[i - 1], ans2 is a list containing two copies of c[i], req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and b[i] and b[n - 1] for all i where b[i] is not equal to b[i + 1], and i is 1. The current value of c[i] is equal to c[i - 1].**

The code snippet appends two copies of the current value of `c[i]` to `ans2`, then decrements `k` by 2. The value of `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, so two copies of `c[i - 1]` are appended to `ans2`. The value of `k` is reduced by 2, but its parity remains even. No other variables are affected by the code.
