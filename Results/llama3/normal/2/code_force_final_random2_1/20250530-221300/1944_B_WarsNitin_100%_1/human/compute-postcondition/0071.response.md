The code prints the elements of the list `ans1`. 

`ans1` is a list containing two copies of the last element of `b` repeated twice, two copies of each `b[i]` where `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, and all elements of `l`. 

Since `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, the last element of `b` is `n`. 

`l` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and `n` inclusive and `b[i]` and `b[n - 1]` for all `i` where `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`. 

Since `b` is sorted, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]` only when `b[i]` is the last occurrence of a number in `b`. 

Therefore, `l` contains the smallest integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, the last occurrence of each number in `b`, and `b[n - 1]`.

`ans1` contains two copies of `n` repeated twice, two copies of each last occurrence of a number in `b`, and all elements of `l`. 

Since `l` contains the smallest integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, the last occurrence of each number in `b`, and `b[n - 1]`, `ans1` contains two copies of `n` repeated twice, two copies of each last occurrence of a number in `b`, the smallest integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, the last occurrence of each number in `b`, and `b[n - 1]`.

Output: **two copies of n repeated twice, two copies of each last occurrence of a number in b, the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, the last occurrence of each number in b, and b[n - 1]**
