Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer at least 3 and at most 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is either 0 or an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing two copies of the last element of `b`, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `l` is either a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and `b[n - 1]` or an empty list, and `i` is 1. The current value of `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`.***
