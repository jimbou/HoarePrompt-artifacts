Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is -2, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the last element of `b` repeated twice, two copies of each `b[i]` where `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, and `l[i]`, `l[i]`, `ans2` is a list containing two copies of each `c[i]` where `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]` and `l[i]`, `l[i]`, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `l` is a list containing at least three elements, and `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
