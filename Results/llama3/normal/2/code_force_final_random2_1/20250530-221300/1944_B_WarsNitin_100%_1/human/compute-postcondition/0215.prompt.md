Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, 1 <= k <= floor(n/2)). The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n (1 <= a_i <= n). Every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    b = a[:n]
    c = a[n:]
    b.sort()
    c.sort()
    ans1 = []
    ans2 = []
    k = 2 * k
    req = k
    l = []
    if b[0] != b[1]:
        l.append(b[0])
    if b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]:
        l.append(b[n - 1])
    else:
        ans1.append(b[n - 1])
        ans1.append(b[n - 1])
        k -= 2
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
            ans1.append(b[i])
            ans1.append(b[i])
            k -= 2
        elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
            l.append(b[i])
    k = req
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
            ans2.append(c[i])
            ans2.append(c[i])
            k -= 2
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if k == 0:
            break
        ans1.append(l[i])
        ans2.append(l[i])
        k -= 1
    print(*ans1)
    print(*ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is -len(l), a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the last element of b repeated twice, two copies of each b[i] where b[i] is equal to b[i - 1], and all elements of l, ans2 is a list containing two copies of each c[i] where c[i] is equal to c[i - 1] and all elements of l, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and b[i] and b[n - 1] for all i where b[i] is not equal to b[i + 1], and i is len(l) - 1, and the following is printed: two copies of each c[i] where c[i] is equal to c[i - 1] and all elements of l

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing either 2n or 2n - 2 instances of the largest integer in b and k instances of l[i], req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is k, ans2 is a list containing 2 * floor(n / 2) instances of the integer at index n - 1 in c and k instances of l[i], l is a list that must have at least k elements, and k is 0, and the list ans1 is printed, ans1 contains either 2n or 2n - 2 instances of the largest integer in b and k instances of l[i], and the list ans2 is printed, ans2 contains 2 * floor(n / 2) instances of the integer at index n - 1 in c and k instances of l[i]

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer greater than 1 and between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is len(l) - 1, ans1 is a list containing len(l) copies of the largest integer in b and l[i], ans2 is a list containing len(l) copies of c[i] if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], otherwise ans2 is a list containing len(l) copies of c[i] and l[i] and an additional element l[i], k is 0, l is a list of len(l) integers, and a list of len(l) copies of the largest integer in b and l[i] is being printed, and ans2 is printed, where ans2 is a list containing len(l) copies of c[i] if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], otherwise ans2 is a list containing len(l) copies of c[i] and l[i] and an additional element l[i]




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
