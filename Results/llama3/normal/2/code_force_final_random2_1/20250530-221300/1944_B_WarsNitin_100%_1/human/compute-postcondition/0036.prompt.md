Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *t is a positive integer greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and b[n - 1] if the second last element of b is not equal to the last element of b. Otherwise, k is an even integer between 0 and n-2 inclusive, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the last element of b, ans2 is an empty list, l is an empty list, and the second last element of b is equal to the last element of b.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
        l.append(b[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer at least 3 and at most 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is either 0 or an even integer between 0 and n inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing two copies of the last element of `b` repeated twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, `l` is either a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and `b[n - 1]` or a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and `b[i]` and `b[n - 1]`, and `i` is 1. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the last element of `b` repeated twice. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `l` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and `b[i]` and `b[n - 1]` if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer at least 3 and at most 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is either 0 or an even integer between 0 and n inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is either an empty list or a list containing two copies of the last element of b repeated twice, ans2 is an empty list, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, l is either a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and b[n - 1] or a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and b[i] and b[n - 1], and i is 2. If b[i] is equal to b[i - 1], then ans1 is a list containing two copies of the last element of b repeated twice. If b[i] is not equal to b[i - 1], then l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, b[i], and b[n - 1] if b[i] is not equal to b[i + 1]. If k is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If b[i] is not equal to b[i + 1], then l is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, b[i], and b[n - 1].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer at least 4 and at most 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is either -2 or an even integer between -2 and `n` inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `b` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `c` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `ans1` is either a list containing two copies of the last element of `b` repeated twice or a list containing two copies of the last element of `b` repeated twice and two copies of `b[i]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is an even integer between 2 and `n` inclusive, and `i` is 3. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the last element of `b` repeated twice. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `l` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `b[i]`, and `b[n - 1]` if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`. If `k` is -2 or 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, then `l` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `b[i]`, and `b[n - 1]`. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i + 1]`, then no changes are made to `l`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
