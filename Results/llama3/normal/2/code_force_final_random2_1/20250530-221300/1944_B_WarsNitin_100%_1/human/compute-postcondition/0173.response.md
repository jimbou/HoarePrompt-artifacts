Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is 3, ans1 is a list with two additional elements equal to b[3], k is reduced by 2.**

In this output state, all variables from the initial state remain unchanged except for `ans1` and `k`. The code appends two elements to `ans1`, both equal to the value of `b` at index `i` (which is 3). The value of `k` is reduced by 2. No other variables are affected by the code snippet.
