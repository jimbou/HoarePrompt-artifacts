Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing either 2n or 2n - 2 instances of the largest integer in b, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is n - 1, ans2 is a list containing 2 * floor(n / 2) instances of the integer at index n - 1 in c, and k is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    if k == 0:
        break
    ans1.append(l[i])
    ans2.append(l[i])
    k -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing either 2n or 2n - 2 instances of the largest integer in b, req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is 0, ans2 is a list containing 2 * floor(n / 2) instances of the integer at index n - 1 in c, l is a list that must have at least 1 element, k is k - 1, ans1 has one more instance of l[i], ans2 has one more instance of l[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing either 2n or 2n - 2 instances of the largest integer in b and one more instance of l[i], req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is 1, ans2 is a list containing 2 * floor(n / 2) instances of the integer at index n - 1 in c and one more instance of l[i], l is a list that must have at least 2 elements, and k is k - 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, a is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, b is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, c is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ans1 is a list containing either 2n or 2n - 2 instances of the largest integer in b, one more instance of l[i], and one more instance of l[i], req is an even integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is 2, ans2 is a list containing 2 * floor(n / 2) instances of the integer at index n - 1 in c, one more instance of l[i], and one more instance of l[i], l is a list that must have at least 2 elements, and k is k - 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
