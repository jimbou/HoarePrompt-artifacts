The only variable in the loop head is variable numbers, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable numbers.  If numbers is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, numbers is a non-empty sorted list of numInteger - 2 integers. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least one more element.
State: **numCases is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, numbers is a non-empty sorted list of numInteger - 1 integers, suma is equal to the minimum of the first two numbers in the original list, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, a is an integer equal to the third last number in the original list, b is an integer equal to the second last number in the original list**
