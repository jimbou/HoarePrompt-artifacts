State: **`numCases` is an integer between 1 and 50, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The second line contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), but the first line of the first test case has been read and its value is stored in `numCases`**
