Output State: **numCases is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, numbers is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, a is an integer equal to the last number in the original list, b is an integer equal to the second last number in the original list, suma is equal to the sum of the minimum of each pair of numbers in the original list.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list of numbers is empty, and the sum of the minimum of each pair of numbers in the original list has been calculated and stored in the variable suma. The other variables remain unchanged.
