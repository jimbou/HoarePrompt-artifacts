Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases (`numCases`) and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of integers (`numInteger`) and the list of integers (`numbers`).
3. It sorts the list of integers in ascending order using the `sort()` method with `reverse=False`. This is correct because the problem statement requires finding the maximum final score, which can be achieved by pairing the smallest numbers together.
4. It initializes a variable `suma` to 0, which will store the sum of the minimum of each pair of adjacent numbers.
5. It enters a while loop that continues until the `numbers` list is empty. In each iteration, it:
	* Pops the first two elements from the sorted list (`a` and `b`) using `pop(0)`.
	* Adds the minimum of `a` and `b` to `suma` using the `min()` function.
6. After the while loop, it prints the final value of `suma`, which represents the maximum final score that can be achieved.

The program correctly implements the problem's requirements and uses the optimal strategy to achieve the maximum final score.

Correctness: **True**
