Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing n moves, where each move involves choosing two integers x and y from the whiteboard, adding min(x, y) to the score, and erasing x and y from the whiteboard.

2. The given program sorts the input numbers in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows the program to always choose the smallest two numbers from the whiteboard in each move, which maximizes the score.

3. The program then enters a while loop that continues until all numbers have been removed from the whiteboard. In each iteration of the loop, it pops the first two numbers from the sorted list (which are the smallest two numbers), adds their minimum to the score, and removes them from the list.

4. The program correctly calculates the maximum final score by adding the minimum of each pair of numbers to the score.

5. The program handles multiple test cases correctly by using a for loop to iterate over the number of test cases and performing the necessary operations for each test case.

6. The program does not have any syntax errors or logical errors that would prevent it from producing the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
