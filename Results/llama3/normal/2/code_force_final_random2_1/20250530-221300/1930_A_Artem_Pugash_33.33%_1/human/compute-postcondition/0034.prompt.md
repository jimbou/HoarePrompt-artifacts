Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `numCases` is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The second line contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), but the first line of the first test case has been read and its value is stored in `numCases`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(numCases):
    numInteger = int(input())
    numbers = input().split()
    numbers.sort(reverse=False)
    suma = 0
    while numbers != []:
        a = int(numbers.pop(0))
        b = int(numbers.pop(0))
        suma += min(a, b)
    print(suma)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: numCases is an integer between 1 and 50, i is 0, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, numbers is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, a is an integer, b is an integer, and the sum of the minimum of each pair of numbers in the original list which is suma is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: numCases is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, numbers is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, a is an integer equal to the last number in the original list, b is an integer equal to the second last number in the original list, suma is equal to the sum of the minimum of each pair of numbers in the original list, and the sum of the minimum of each pair of numbers in the original list which is suma is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: numCases is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, numbers is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, a is an integer equal to the last number in the original list, b is an integer equal to the second last number in the original list, and the sum of the minimum of each pair of adjacent numbers in the original list, which is equal to suma, is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
