Output State: **numCases is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, numbers is an empty list, suma is equal to the sum of the minimum of each pair of adjacent numbers in the original list, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, a is an integer equal to the last number in the original list, b is an integer equal to the second last number in the original list.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list "numbers" is empty, and the variable "suma" contains the sum of the minimum of each pair of adjacent numbers in the original list. The other variables remain unchanged.
