Output State: **numCases is an integer between 1 and 50, i is equal to numCases - 1, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, numbers is an empty list, stdin contains no test cases, a is an integer equal to the last number in the original list, b is an integer equal to the second last number in the original list, and the sum of the minimum of each pair of adjacent numbers in the original list, which is equal to suma, is being printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the loop counter `i` will be equal to `numCases - 1`, indicating that the loop has executed `numCases` times. The `numbers` list will be empty, as all numbers have been processed. The `stdin` will contain no test cases, as all test cases have been read and processed. The variables `a` and `b` will hold the last two numbers in the original list, and the `suma` variable will hold the sum of the minimum of each pair of adjacent numbers in the original list, which is being printed.
