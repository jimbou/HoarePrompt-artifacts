To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `numCases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `numCases`. If `i` is less than `numCases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `numCases` is an integer between 1 and 50.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `numCases` remains the same, but since `i` is now 1, `numCases` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables, such as `numInteger`, `numbers`, `stdin`, `a`, `b`, and `suma`, are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution. Therefore, their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`numCases` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an integer between 1 and 50, `numbers` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and the sum of the minimum of each pair of numbers in the original list which is `suma` is being printed**
