Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: numCases is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, numbers is a sorted list of numInteger integers, suma is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, a is an integer equal to the last number in the original list, b is an integer equal to the second last number in the original list.
Code of the loop:
while numbers != []:
    a = int(numbers.pop(0))
    b = int(numbers.pop(0))
    suma += min(a, b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: numCases is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, numbers is a non-empty sorted list of numInteger - 2 integers, suma is equal to the minimum of the first two numbers in the original list, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, a is an integer equal to the third last number in the original list, b is an integer equal to the second last number in the original list
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: numCases is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, numbers is a non-empty sorted list of numInteger - 3 integers, suma is equal to the minimum of the first two numbers in the original list plus the minimum of the third last and second last numbers in the original list, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, a is an integer equal to the third last number in the original list, b is an integer equal to the second last number in the original list
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: numCases is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, numbers is a non-empty sorted list of at least numInteger - 2 integers, suma is equal to the minimum of the first two numbers in the original list plus the minimum of the third last and second last numbers in the original list plus the minimum of a and b, a is an integer equal to the second last number in the original list, b is an integer equal to the last number in the original list, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
