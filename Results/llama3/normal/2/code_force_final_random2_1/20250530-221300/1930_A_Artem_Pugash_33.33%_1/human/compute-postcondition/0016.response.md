The only variable in the loop head is variable numbers, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable numbers.  If numbers is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, numbers is a sorted list of numInteger - 2 integers. So for the loop to be executed one more time, numbers must be a sorted list of numInteger - 1 integers.
State: **numCases is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, numbers is a sorted list of numInteger - 1 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, a is an integer equal to the first number in the original list, b is an integer equal to the second number in the original list, suma is equal to the minimum of a and b, which is the minimum of the first two numbers in the original list.**
