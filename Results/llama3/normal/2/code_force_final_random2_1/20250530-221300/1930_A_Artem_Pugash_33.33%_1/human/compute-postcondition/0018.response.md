According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable numbers. If numbers is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, numbers is a sorted list of numInteger - 3 integers. For the loop to be executed one more time, numbers must not be empty, so it must have at least one integer. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **numCases is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, numbers is a sorted list of at least one integer, a is an integer equal to the third number in the original list, b is an integer equal to the fourth number in the original list, suma is equal to the minimum of the first four numbers in the original list.**
