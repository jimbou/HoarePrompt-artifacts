Output State: **numCases is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, numbers is a sorted list of numInteger integers, suma is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, a is an integer equal to the last number in the original list, b is an integer equal to the second last number in the original list.**

Explanation: The first line of the code reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to numInteger, which is now a specific integer between 1 and 50. The second line reads a list of numInteger integers from stdin, splits them into a list, and assigns it to numbers. The third line sorts the list in ascending order. The fourth line initializes suma to 0. The values of numCases, i, a, and b remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. Stdin now contains one less test case.
