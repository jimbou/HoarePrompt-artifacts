Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over each case.
2. For each case, it reads the number of integers (2n) and the integers themselves.
3. It sorts the integers in ascending order, which is necessary to find the maximum final score.
4. It then enters a loop where it pops the smallest two integers from the sorted list, adds the smaller one to the score, and repeats this process until all integers have been processed.
5. Finally, it prints the maximum final score.

The program correctly implements the problem description, and I couldn't find any potential case where it would not work as expected. The sorting step ensures that the smallest integers are always chosen first, which maximizes the final score. The loop correctly processes all integers, and the scoring logic is correct.

Overall, the program is correct, and I couldn't find any case where it would not produce the expected output.
