Output State: **numCases is an integer between 1 and 50, i is 0, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, numbers is a list of at least 0 integers, suma is x + min(a, b) + min(a, b), a is an integer, b is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the values of `numCases`, `i`, and `numInteger` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The list `numbers` has at least two fewer integers than before, as two integers were removed from it. The value of `suma` has increased by the minimum of `a` and `b`, which were the first two integers in the list `numbers`. The values of `a` and `b` are now the first two integers that were removed from the list `numbers`. Stdin contains one fewer test case than before, as one test case was processed.
