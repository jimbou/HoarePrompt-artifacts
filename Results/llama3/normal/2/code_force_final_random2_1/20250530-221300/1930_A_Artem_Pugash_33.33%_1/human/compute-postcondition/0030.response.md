Output State: **numCases is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, numbers is a non-empty sorted list of at least numInteger - 2 integers, suma is equal to the minimum of the first two numbers in the original list plus the minimum of the third last and second last numbers in the original list plus the minimum of a and b, a is an integer equal to the second last number in the original list, b is an integer equal to the last number in the original list, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In this output state, the values of `numCases`, `i`, `numInteger`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The list `numbers` has been modified by removing its first two elements. The variable `suma` has been updated by adding the minimum of `a` and `b` to its original value. The values of `a` and `b` have been updated to the second last and last numbers in the original list, respectively.
