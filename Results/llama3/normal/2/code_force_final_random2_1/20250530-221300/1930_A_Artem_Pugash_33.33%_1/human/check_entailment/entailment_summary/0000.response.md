Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the number of integers in each test case.
2.  It sorts the integers in ascending order, which is necessary to find the maximum final score.
3.  It pairs up the integers and calculates the sum of the minimum value in each pair, which is the optimal strategy to achieve the maximum final score.
4.  It prints the sum for each test case, which is the required output.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the strategy to achieve the maximum final score. The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
