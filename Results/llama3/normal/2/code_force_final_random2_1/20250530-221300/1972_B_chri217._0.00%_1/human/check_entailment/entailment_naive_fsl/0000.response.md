Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input "UUDDUU". The program will output "YES" because the number of 'U's is odd, but Alice will actually lose the game. 

The problem description states that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will win. However, the program does not take into account the arrangement of the coins, only the number of 'U's. This means that it does not correctly determine who will win the game in all cases.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the arrangement of the coins and the rules of the game. We need to find a way to determine who will win the game based on the initial arrangement of the coins, not just the number of 'U's.
