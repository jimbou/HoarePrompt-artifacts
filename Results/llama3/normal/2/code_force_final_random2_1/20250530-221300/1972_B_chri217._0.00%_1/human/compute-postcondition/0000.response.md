Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, where `n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 100), containing only "U" and "D" characters, `num_up` is the number of 'U' characters in `s`.**

In this output state, the value of `num_up` is equal to the number of 'U' characters in the string `s`. The length of the string `s` is still `n`, and it still contains only "U" and "D" characters. The value of `n` is still a positive integer between 1 and 100.
