Reasoning:

The problem requires determining who will win the game if they both play optimally. The game involves removing a facing-up coin and flipping the two adjacent coins. The game ends when there are no facing-up coins left, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input, representing the initial state of the coins. The function counts the number of 'U' characters in the string, which represents the number of facing-up coins. If the count is odd, the function returns 'YES', indicating that Alice will win. Otherwise, it returns 'NO', indicating that Bob will win.

The reasoning behind this approach is that if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always make a move that will leave an even number of facing-up coins for Bob. This means that Bob will eventually be left with no facing-up coins and will lose the game. On the other hand, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always make a move that will leave an odd number of facing-up coins for Alice, forcing her to lose.

The program then reads the input data, which includes the number of test cases `t`, the number of coins `n`, and the initial state of the coins `s`. It iterates over each test case, calling the `func_1` function with the input string `s` and printing the result.

Correctness: **True**
