Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 499,999, `details` is a list containing two tuples of three elements: the first tuple contains the balance (2 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise 0), the negative index of the first character in the string (which is -1), and the first character in the string (which is either '(' or ')'), and the second tuple contains the balance (1 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise -1), the negative index of the second character in the string (which is -2), and the second character in the string (which is either '(' or ')'), stdin is empty, `i` is 2, `balance` is 0 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise -2, and `char` is the second character in the string `s` (which is either '(' or ')').**

In this output state, the value of `balance` has been updated to be one less than its initial value, which was 1 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise -1. The other variables remain unchanged.
