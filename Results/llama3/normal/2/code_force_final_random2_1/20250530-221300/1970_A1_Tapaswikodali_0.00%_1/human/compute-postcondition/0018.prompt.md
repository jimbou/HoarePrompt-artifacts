Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, balance is 0, details is an empty list, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i, char in enumerate(s):
    if char == '(':
        balance += 1
    else:
        balance -= 1
    details.append((balance, -i, char))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `details` is a list containing a tuple of three elements: the balance (1 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise -1), the negative index of the first character in the string (which is -0), and the first character in the string (which is either '(' or ')'), stdin is empty, `i` is 0, and the value of `balance` is 1 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 499,999, `details` is a list containing two tuples of three elements: the first tuple contains the balance (2 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise 0), the negative index of the first character in the string (which is -1), and the first character in the string (which is either '(' or ')'), and the second tuple contains the balance (1 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise -1), the negative index of the second character in the string (which is -2), and the second character in the string (which is either '(' or ')'), stdin is empty, `i` is 1, and the value of `balance` is 1 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 499,999, `details` is a list containing three tuples of three elements: the first tuple contains the balance (2 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise 0), the negative index of the first character in the string (which is -1), and the first character in the string (which is either '(' or ')'), the second tuple contains the balance (1 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise -1), the negative index of the second character in the string (which is -2), and the second character in the string (which is either '(' or ')'), and the third tuple contains the balance (updated based on the value of `char`: if `char` is '(', `balance` is 2 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise 0; if `char` is ')', `balance` is 0 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise -2), the negative index of the third character in the string (which is -3), and the third character in the string (which is either '(' or ')'), stdin is empty, `i` is 2, and `balance` is updated based on the value of `char`: if `char` is '(', `balance` is 2 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise 0; if `char` is ')', `balance` is 0 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise -2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
