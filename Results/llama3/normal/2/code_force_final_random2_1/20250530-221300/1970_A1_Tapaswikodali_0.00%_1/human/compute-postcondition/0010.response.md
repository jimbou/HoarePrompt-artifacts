Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 499,999, `details` is a list containing a tuple of three elements: the balance (1 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise -1), the negative index of the first character in the string (which is -1), and the first character in the string (which is either '(' or ')'), stdin is empty, `i` is 1, and the value of `balance` is 0 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise -2**

The value of `balance` is decreased by 1. Since the initial value of `balance` is 1 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise -1, the new value of `balance` will be 0 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise -2. The states of the other variables are not affected.
