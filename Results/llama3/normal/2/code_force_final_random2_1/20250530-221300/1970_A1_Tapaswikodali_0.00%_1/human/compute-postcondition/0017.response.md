Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 499,999, `details` is a list containing three tuples of three elements: the first tuple contains the balance (2 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise 0), the negative index of the first character in the string (which is -1), and the first character in the string (which is either '(' or ')'), the second tuple contains the balance (1 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise -1), the negative index of the second character in the string (which is -2), and the second character in the string (which is either '(' or ')'), and the third tuple contains the balance (updated based on the value of `char`: if `char` is '(', `balance` is 2 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise 0; if `char` is ')', `balance` is 0 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise -2), the negative index of the third character in the string (which is -3), and the third character in the string (which is either '(' or ')'), stdin is empty, `i` is 2, and `balance` is updated based on the value of `char`: if `char` is '(', `balance` is 2 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise 0; if `char` is ')', `balance` is 0 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise -2.**

In this output state, the list `details` has been updated to include a new tuple containing the balance, negative index, and character at the current position `i` in the string `s`. The balance is updated based on the value of `char`, which is either '(' or ')'. The other variables remain unchanged.
