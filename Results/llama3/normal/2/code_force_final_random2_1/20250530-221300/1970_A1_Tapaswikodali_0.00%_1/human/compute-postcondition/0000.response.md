Output State: **s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, balance is 0, details is an empty list, stdin is empty**

The code snippet reads a string from stdin and assigns it to the variable `s`. Since the input string is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000, `s` will hold this value. The second line initializes the variable `balance` to 0. The third line creates an empty list and assigns it to the variable `details`. After executing the code, stdin is empty because the input string has been read and assigned to `s`.
