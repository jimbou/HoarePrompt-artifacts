Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `details` is a list containing a tuple of three elements: the balance (1 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise -1), the negative index of the first character in the string (which is -0), and the first character in the string (which is either '(' or ')'), stdin is empty, `i` is 0, and the value of `balance` is 1 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise -1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` remains unchanged, the list `details` now contains information about the first character in the string, including its balance, index, and the character itself. The other variables, including `stdin`, `i`, and `balance`, retain their initial values.
