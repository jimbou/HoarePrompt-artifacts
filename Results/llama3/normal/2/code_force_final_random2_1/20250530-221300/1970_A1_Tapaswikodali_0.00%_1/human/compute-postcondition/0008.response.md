To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `s`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `s` is a non-empty string with a length not exceeding 500,000.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The string `s` remains the same, but we need to consider the next character in the string. Since the first character in the string is either '(' or ')', the next character in the string is the second character.

The state of `details` is not affected by the loop head, so it remains the same. The state of `stdin` is also not affected, so it remains empty.

The value of `balance` is not explicitly mentioned in the loop head, but it is related to the first character in the string. Since the first character in the string is either '(' or ')', the balance is either 1 or -1, respectively.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 499,999, `details` is a list containing a tuple of three elements: the balance (1 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise -1), the negative index of the first character in the string (which is -1), and the first character in the string (which is either '(' or ')'), stdin is empty, `i` is 1, and the value of `balance` is 1 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise -1**
