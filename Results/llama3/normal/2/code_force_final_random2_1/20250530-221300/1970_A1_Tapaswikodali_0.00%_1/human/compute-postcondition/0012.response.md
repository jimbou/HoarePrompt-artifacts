Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 499,999, `details` is a list containing two tuples of three elements: the first tuple contains the balance (2 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise 0), the negative index of the first character in the string (which is -1), and the first character in the string (which is either '(' or ')'), and the second tuple contains the balance (1 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise -1), the negative index of the second character in the string (which is -2), and the second character in the string (which is either '(' or ')'), stdin is empty, `i` is 1, and the value of `balance` is 1 if the first character in the string is '(', otherwise -1.**

In this output state, the `details` list now contains two tuples, each representing the balance, negative index, and character at the current position in the string. The first tuple is the same as in the initial state, and the second tuple is new and corresponds to the second character in the string. The value of `balance` is updated based on the second character in the string. All other variables remain unchanged.
