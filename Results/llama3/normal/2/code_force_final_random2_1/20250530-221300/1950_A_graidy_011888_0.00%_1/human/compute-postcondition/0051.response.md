Functionality: **Generates and prints 1000 sets of three random digits (x, y, z) between 1 and 9, along with a classification of the sequence as 'peak', 'stair', or 'none' based on the relative values of x, y, and z. The classification is determined by the following rules: if x < y, then if y > z, the sequence is classified as 'peak'; if y < z, it is classified as 'stair'; otherwise, it is classified as 'none'. If x is not less than y, the sequence is classified as 'none'. The values of x, y, and z, along with their classification, are printed to the console.**
