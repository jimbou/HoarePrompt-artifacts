Output State: **`i` is 1, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9).**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been assigned to 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9).
