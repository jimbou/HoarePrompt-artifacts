Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, `res` is 'stair', stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9)**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to 'stair', while the values of `i`, `x`, `y`, `z` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains two inputs: an integer t and t lines of three digits each.
