Output State: **`i` is less than 1000, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, `res` is 'none', stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9)**

The code sets the value of `res` to 'none', leaving all other variables unchanged. The stdin still contains two inputs: the integer t and the t lines of three digits each.
