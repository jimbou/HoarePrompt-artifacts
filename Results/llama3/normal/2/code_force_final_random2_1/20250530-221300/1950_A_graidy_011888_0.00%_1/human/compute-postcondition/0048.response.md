Output State: **`i` is less than 1001, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) and then `t` lines each containing three digits `a`, `b`, `c` (0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 9). If `x` < `y`, then if `y` > `z`, `res` is 'peak'. If `y` < `z`, then `res` is 'stair'. If `y` == `z`, then `res` is 'none'. If `x` >= `y`, then `res` is 'none', and the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are printed separated by a space, and `res` is printed**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` was less than 1000, so the new value of `i` is less than 1001. The values of `x`, `y`, `z`, `res`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
