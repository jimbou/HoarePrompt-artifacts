Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If x < y, then if y > z, res is 'peak', if y < z, res is 'stair', otherwise res is 'none'. If x is not less than y, then res is 'none'. The values of x, y, and z are printed, separated by spaces, and res is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain the same, as integers between 1 and 9. The input in stdin is still the same, with two inputs: an integer `t` and `t` lines of three digits each. The condition for `res` is still the same, depending on the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are printed, followed by the value of `res`.
