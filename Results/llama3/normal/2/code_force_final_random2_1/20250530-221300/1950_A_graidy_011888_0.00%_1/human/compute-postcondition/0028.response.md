Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, `res` is 'none', stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9)**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` has been changed to 'none', while the values of `i`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain the same. The stdin still contains two inputs: the first is an integer t, and the second is t lines of three digits each.
