Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, `res` is 'none', stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). The current value of x is less than the current value of y. y is equal to z**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to 'none', while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains two inputs: the integer t and the t lines of three digits each. The relationships between x, y, and z also remain unchanged, with x being less than y and y being equal to z.
