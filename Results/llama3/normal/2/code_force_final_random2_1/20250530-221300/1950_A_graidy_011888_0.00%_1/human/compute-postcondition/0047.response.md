Output: **i is less than 1000, x is an integer between 1 and 9, y is an integer between 1 and 9, z is an integer between 1 and 9, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If x < y, then if y > z, res is 'peak'. If y < z, then res is 'stair'. If y == z, then res is 'none'. If x >= y, then res is 'none', and the values of x, y, and z are printed separated by a space, and res is printed**
