Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, `res` is 'stair', stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). The current value of x is less than the current value of y. The current value of y is less than the current value of z**

The value of `res` has been changed to 'stair'. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). The current value of x is still less than the current value of y. The current value of y is still less than the current value of z.
