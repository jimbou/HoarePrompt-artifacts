Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, `res` is 'none', stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9)**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to 'none', while the values of `i`, `x`, `y`, `z`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
