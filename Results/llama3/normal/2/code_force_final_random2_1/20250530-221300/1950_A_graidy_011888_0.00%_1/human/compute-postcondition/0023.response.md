Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, `res` is 'peak', stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9)**

The code assigns the string 'peak' to the variable `res`. The values of the other variables `i`, `x`, `y`, `z` remain unchanged. The state of the stdin also remains the same, containing two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9).
