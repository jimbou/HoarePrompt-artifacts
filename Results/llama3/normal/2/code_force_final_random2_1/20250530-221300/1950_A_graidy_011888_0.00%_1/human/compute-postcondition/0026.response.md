Postcondition: ***i is 2, x is an integer between 1 and 9, y is an integer between 1 and 9, z is an integer between 1 and 9, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If y is less than z, res is 'stair', otherwise res is 'none'.***
