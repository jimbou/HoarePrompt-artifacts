Postcondition: ***i is 1, x is an integer between 1 and 9, y is an integer between 1 and 9, z is an integer between 1 and 9, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If x < y, then if y > z, res is 'peak', if y < z, res is 'stair', otherwise res is 'none'. If x is not less than y, then res is 'none'.***
