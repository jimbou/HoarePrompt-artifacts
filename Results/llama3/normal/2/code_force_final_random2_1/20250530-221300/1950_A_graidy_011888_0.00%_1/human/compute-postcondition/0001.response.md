According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to 1000, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 1, which is less than 1000, so the loop can certainly execute one time. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 1, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9)**
