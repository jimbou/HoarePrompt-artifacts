Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, `res` is 'none', `x` is not less than `y`, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) and then `t` lines each containing three digits `a`, `b`, `c` (0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 9).**

The value of `res` has been changed to 'none'. The values of the other variables are not affected.
