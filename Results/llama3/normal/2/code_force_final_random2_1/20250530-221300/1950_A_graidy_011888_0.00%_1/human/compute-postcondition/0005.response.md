Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, `res` is 'peak', stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). The current value of x is less than the current value of y. The current value of y is greater than the current value of z.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` has been changed to 'peak'. The values of `i`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain the same. The stdin still contains two inputs: an integer t and t lines of three digits each. The conditions that x is less than y and y is greater than z still hold.
