Output State: **`i` is less than 1000, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, `res` is 'peak', stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9)**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to 'peak'. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains two inputs: an integer t and t lines of three digits each.
