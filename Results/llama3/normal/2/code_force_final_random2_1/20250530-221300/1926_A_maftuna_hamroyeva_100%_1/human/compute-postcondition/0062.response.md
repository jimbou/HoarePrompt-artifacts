Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 3 characters, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If the third character `j` in the string `a` is 'A', then `l` is 3 and `h` is 0. If the third character `j` in the string `a` is not 'A', then `l` is 1 and `h` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1. If the third character `j` in the string `a` is 'A', then `l` is now 3, otherwise, it is 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
