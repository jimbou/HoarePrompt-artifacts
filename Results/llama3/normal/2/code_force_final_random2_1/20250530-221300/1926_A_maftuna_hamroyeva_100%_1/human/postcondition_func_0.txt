This function reads a sequence of strings from standard input, where each string consists of letters 'A' and 'B', and prints a sequence of 'A's and 'B's indicating whether the number of 'A's is greater than the number of 'B's in each string. The function processes a specified number of strings, as indicated by an initial integer input, and prints the results in the same order as the input strings.
