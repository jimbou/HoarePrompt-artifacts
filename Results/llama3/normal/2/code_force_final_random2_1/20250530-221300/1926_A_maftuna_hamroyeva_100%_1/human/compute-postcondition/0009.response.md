The only objects in the loop head are variables  j and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string a.  If the string a has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, a is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, j is the first character in the string a. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string a must have at least 4 characters and the j is the second character in the string a.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a string of length 4 consisting of letters A and B, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the second character in the string `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is 1 and `h` is 0. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `h` is 1.**
