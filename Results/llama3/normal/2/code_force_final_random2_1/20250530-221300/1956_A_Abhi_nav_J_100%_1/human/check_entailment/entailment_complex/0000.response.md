Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. However, there are a few issues with the program.

Firstly, the function `func_1` is not defined in the given code. The function is supposed to take two integers as input and return the number of players declared as winners. However, the function definition is missing.

Secondly, the program is trying to print the result of `func_1` for each value in `q_wali_list`, but the function is not defined.

Lastly, the problem statement requires the program to output the number of players declared as winners for each value in `q_wali_list`, but the program is trying to print the result of `func_1` which is not defined.

Correctness: **False**
