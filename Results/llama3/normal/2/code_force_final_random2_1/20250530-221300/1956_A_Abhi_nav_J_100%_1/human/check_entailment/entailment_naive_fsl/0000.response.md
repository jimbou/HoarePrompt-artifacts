Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` only considers the first element of the sequence `a` and the value of `n_i`, but it does not take into account the rest of the sequence `a` and the fact that players are kicked out simultaneously.

A counterexample is when `a = [3, 5]` and `n_i = 5`. The program will output `2`, but the correct output should be `2` because players `C` and `E` are kicked out in the first round, and player `D` is kicked out in the second round, leaving players `A` and `B` as winners.

The program does not correctly simulate the game logic and does not consider all the elements of the sequence `a` and the simultaneous removal of players. Therefore, it is incorrect.
