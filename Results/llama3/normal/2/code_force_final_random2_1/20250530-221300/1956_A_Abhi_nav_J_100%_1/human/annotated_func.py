#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of distinct integers, b is a list of integers.
    if (a <= b) :
        return a - 1
        #The program returns a list of distinct integers that is less than or equal to list b, minus 1.
    else :
        return b
        #The program returns list b, which is a list of integers and is less than list a.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function compares two lists of integers, a and b, and returns a list that is less than or equal to the other list, with an adjustment of subtracting 1 from the returned list if a is less than or equal to b. If a is greater than b, the function returns list b without modification.
