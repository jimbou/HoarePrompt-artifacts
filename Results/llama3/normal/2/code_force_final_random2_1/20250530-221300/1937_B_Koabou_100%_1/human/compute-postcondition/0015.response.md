Postcondition: ***a is a list containing two test cases, n is an integer that must be greater than 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, _ is 2, the integer 2 is not greater than 2. If a[0][i + 1] is '1' and a[1][i] is '0', then s is a list containing the first i + 1 elements of a[0] and the last len(a[1]) - i elements of a[1], x is equal to i, and y is equal to i. Otherwise, the values of x, y, and s remain unchanged. The value of i remains the same in both cases.***
