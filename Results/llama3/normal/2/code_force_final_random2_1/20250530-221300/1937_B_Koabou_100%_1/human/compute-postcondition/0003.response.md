To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for _ in range(2):`. The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the integer `2`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `_` and the integer `2`. If `_` is less than `2`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and the integer `2` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 1.

The state of `a`, `n`, and `stdin` does not affect the loop execution, so their states remain the same.

State: **`a` is a list containing one test case, `n` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `_` is 1, and the integer `2` is greater than 1**
