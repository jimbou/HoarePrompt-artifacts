Postcondition: ***`a` is a list containing two test cases, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 3, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `x` and `s` remain unchanged. If `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', then `s` is a string that is a combination of the first `i + 1` characters of `a[0]` and the last `len(a[1]) - i` characters of `a[1]`, `x` is an integer equal to `i`, `y` is 3, and `_` is 2. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `a[0][i + 1]` is '0' and `a[1][i]` is '1', then `i` is 3 and `y` is 3. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
