Postcondition: ***a is a list containing two test cases, n is an integer, _ is 2, the integer 2 is not greater than 2, s is a list containing the first x elements of a[0] and the last len(a[1]) - x elements of a[1], x is an integer equal to the value of i that caused the loop to break, y is less than x, i is y + 1. If a[1][i:x] is equal to s[i + 1:x + 1], then t is x - i + 1.***
