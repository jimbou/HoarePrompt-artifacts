Output State: **`a` is a list containing two test cases, `n` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `_` is 1, and the integer `2` is greater than 1**

In this output state, the list `a` now contains two test cases because it initially contained one test case and another test case was appended to it using the `input()` function. The value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus three test cases because one more test case was read from the input. The value of `_` remains 1, and the integer `2` is still greater than 1.
