Output State: **a is a list containing two test cases, n is an integer that must be greater than 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, _ is 2, the integer 2 is not greater than 2, s is an empty list, x is 0, y is 0, i is 0. The current value of a[0][i + 1] is '0' and the current value of a[1][i] is '1' and y is equal to i.**

In natural language, the output state is: a contains two test cases, n is greater than 1, stdin has multiple test cases minus three test cases, _ is 2, 2 is not greater than 2, s is empty, x and i are 0, y is also 0 and is equal to i. The first test case's second character is '0' and the second test case's first character is '1'.
