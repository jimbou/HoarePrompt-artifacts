Output State: **`a` is a list containing three test cases, `n` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, `_` is 2, and the integer `2` is greater than 1**

In this output state, the list `a` now contains three test cases because the `input()` function accepts a test case from the stdin and appends it to the list `a`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus four test cases because one test case has been consumed by the `input()` function. The value of `_` remains unchanged as 2, and the integer `2` is still greater than 1.
