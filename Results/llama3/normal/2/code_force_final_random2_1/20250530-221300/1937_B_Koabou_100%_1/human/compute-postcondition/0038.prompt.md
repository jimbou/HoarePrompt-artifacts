Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list containing two test cases, n is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, _ is 2, the integer 2 is not greater than 2, s is a list containing the first x elements of a[0] and the last len(a[1]) - x elements of a[1], x is an integer equal to the value of i that caused the loop to break, y is equal to the value of i that caused the loop to break, and t is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(y, x):
    if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
        t = x - i + 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list containing two test cases, `n` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `_` is 2, the integer 2 is not greater than 2, `s` is a list containing the first `x` elements of `a[0]` and the last `len(a[1]) - x` elements of `a[1]`, `x` is an integer equal to the value of `i` that caused the loop to break, `y` is less than `x`, `i` is `y`, and if `a[1][i:x]` is equal to `s[i + 1:x + 1]`, then `t` is `x - i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *a is a list containing two test cases, n is an integer, _ is 2, the integer 2 is not greater than 2, s is a list containing the first x elements of a[0] and the last len(a[1]) - x elements of a[1], x is an integer equal to the value of i that caused the loop to break, y is less than x, i is y + 1. If a[1][i:x] is equal to s[i + 1:x + 1], then t is x - i + 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: a is a list containing two test cases, n is an integer, _ is 2, the integer 2 is not greater than 2, s is a list containing the first x elements of a[0] and the last len(a[1]) - x elements of a[1], x is an integer equal to the value of i that caused the loop to break, y is less than x, i is y + 2, t is x - i + 1. If a[1][i:x] is equal to s[i + 1:x + 1], then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part in the code.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
