Postcondition: ***`a` is a list containing two test cases, `n` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `_` is 2, the integer 2 is not greater than 2, `s` is a list containing the first `x` elements of `a[0]` and the last `len(a[1]) - x` elements of `a[1]`, `x` is an integer equal to the value of `i` that caused the loop to break, `y` is less than `x`, `i` is `y`, and `t` is 1. The current value of `a[1][i:x]` is equal to `s[i + 1:x + 1]`***
