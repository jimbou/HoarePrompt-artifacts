Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list containing two test cases, n is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, _ is 2, the integer 2 is not greater than 2, s is an empty list, x is 0, and y is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
        y = i
    if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
        s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
        x = i
        break
else:
    s = a[0] + a[1][n - 1]
    x = n - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *a is a list containing two test cases, n is an integer that must be greater than 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, _ is 2, the integer 2 is not greater than 2. If a[0][i + 1] is '1' and a[1][i] is '0', then s is a list containing the first i + 1 elements of a[0] and the last len(a[1]) - i elements of a[1], x is equal to i, and y is equal to i. Otherwise, the values of x, y, and s remain unchanged. The value of i remains the same in both cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a list containing two test cases, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `_` is 2, the integer 2 is not greater than 2. If `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', then `s` is a list containing the first `i + 1` elements of `a[0]` and the last `len(a[1]) - i` elements of `a[1]`, `x` is equal to `i`, and `y` is equal to `i`. Otherwise, `x`, `y`, and `s` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a list containing two test cases, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 3, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `x` and `s` remain unchanged. If `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', then `s` is a string that is a combination of the first `i + 1` characters of `a[0]` and the last `len(a[1]) - i` characters of `a[1]`, `x` is an integer equal to `i`, `y` is 3, and `_` is 2. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `a[0][i + 1]` is '0' and `a[1][i]` is '1', then `i` is 3 and `y` is 3. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
