Output State: **`a` is a list containing two test cases, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 3, `s` is a string that is a combination of the first `i + 1` characters of `a[0]` and the last `len(a[1]) - i` characters of `a[1]`, `x` is an integer equal to `i`, `y` is 3, and `_` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `s` is a combination of the first `i + 1` characters of `a[0]` and the last `len(a[1]) - i` characters of `a[1]`. The value of `x` is equal to `i`. The value of `y` is 3. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer greater than 3. The value of `a` remains unchanged as a list containing two test cases.
