Output State: **a is a list containing two test cases, n is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, _ is 2, the integer 2 is not greater than 2, s is a list containing the first x elements of a[0] and the last len(a[1]) - x elements of a[1], x is an integer equal to the value of i that caused the loop to break, y is equal to the value of i that caused the loop to break, and t is 1.**

In this output state, the value of t has been updated to 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list a still contains two test cases, n is still an integer, stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, _ is still 2, the integer 2 is still not greater than 2, s is still a list containing the first x elements of a[0] and the last len(a[1]) - x elements of a[1], x is still an integer equal to the value of i that caused the loop to break, and y is still equal to the value of i that caused the loop to break.
