According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and the integer `2`. If the integer `2` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, a is an empty list and n is an integer and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `_` is 0 and the integer `2` is greater than 0.
State: **`a` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `_` is 0, the integer `2` is greater than 0**
