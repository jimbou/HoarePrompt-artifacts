Postcondition: ***`a` is a list containing two test cases, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 3, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `_` is 2, `x` and `s` remain unchanged. If `a[0][i + 1]` is '0' and `a[1][i]` is '1', then `i` is 3 and `y` is 3. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
