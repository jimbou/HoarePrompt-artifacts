Based on the precondition, the variable `t` is calculated as `x - (x - 1) + 1`. Since `x` is an integer equal to the value of `i` that caused the loop to break, and `i` is `x - 1`, we can substitute `x` with `i + 1`.

So, `t` becomes `(i + 1) - (i + 1 - 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `i + 1 - i + 1`, and further simplifies to `2`.

Therefore, the `print(t)` statement will print the value of `t`, which is `2`.

Output: **2**
