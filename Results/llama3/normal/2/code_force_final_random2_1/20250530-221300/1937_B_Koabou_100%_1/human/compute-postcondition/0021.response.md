To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 (since `_` is 2) and `n` is greater than 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `n` is greater than 2, it must also be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables, `a`, `stdin`, `x`, `y`, and `s`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is a list containing two test cases, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 3, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `_` is 2, `i` is 3, `x`, `y`, and `s` remain unchanged**
