To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(2):`. The objects involved are `_` and the integer `2`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and the integer `2` is greater than 1.

To execute the loop again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 2. However, since the loop condition is `_` less than `2`, the loop will not execute again if `_` is equal to 2. Therefore, the loop will not execute again.

The states of the other objects, `a`, `n`, and `stdin`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is a list containing two test cases, `n` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `_` is 2, and the integer `2` is greater than 1**
