Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider the input:

3
2
01
10

The program will output:

010
1

However, the lexicographically smallest string that can be attained by choosing any available path is actually "001", not "010". The program fails to consider the case where the grasshopper jumps down to the second row and then moves right.

The program also fails to correctly count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string. In this case, there are two paths that yield the string "001", but the program only outputs 1.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
