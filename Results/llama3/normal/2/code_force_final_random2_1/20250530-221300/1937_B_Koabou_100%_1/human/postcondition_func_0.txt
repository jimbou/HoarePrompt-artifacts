This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer (n) and two binary strings of length n. It then attempts to find a prefix of the first binary string and a suffix of the second binary string that can be combined to form a new binary string. If such a combination is found, it prints the resulting binary string and the length of the overlapping suffix. If no combination is found, it does not print anything. The function processes each test case independently and does not retain any information from previous test cases.
