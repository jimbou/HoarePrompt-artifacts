Output State: **`a` is a list containing two test cases, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `_` is 2, the integer 2 is not greater than 2. If `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', then `s` is a list containing the first `i + 1` elements of `a[0]` and the last `len(a[1]) - i` elements of `a[1]`, `x` is equal to `i`, and `y` is equal to `i`. Otherwise, the values of `x`, `y`, and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is 2 and `y` is equal to 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `a` still contains two test cases, and the integer `n` remains greater than 2. The standard input `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. The variable `_` is still equal to 2, and the integer 2 is still not greater than 2. The values of `s`, `x`, and `y` are still dependent on the conditions specified in the initial state. However, the value of `y` has been updated to be equal to the value of `i`, which is 2.
