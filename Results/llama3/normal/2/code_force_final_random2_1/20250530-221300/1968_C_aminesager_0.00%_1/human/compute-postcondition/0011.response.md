Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 inclusive, a is a list containing n integers where each element is 1000 minus the sum of the corresponding elements in T, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each remaining test case, first an integer n (2 <= n <= 500) and then n-1 integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500), result is a string containing the elements of a in reverse order, separated by spaces.**

The first line reverses the order of the elements in list `a`. The second line converts each element of `a` to a string and joins them together with spaces in between, assigning the result to the variable `result`. The value of `t`, `n`, `T`, `i`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
