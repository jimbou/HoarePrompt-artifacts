Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find any array a_1, ..., a_n that satisfies the given conditions. 

Here's why:

* The program starts with a_1 = 1000, which is a valid choice since 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
* For each x_i (2 ≤ i ≤ n), it calculates a_i as a_(i-1) - x_i. This ensures that x_i = a_i mod a_(i-1), as required.
* The program prints the calculated array in reverse order, which is also correct.

The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the example output matches the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
