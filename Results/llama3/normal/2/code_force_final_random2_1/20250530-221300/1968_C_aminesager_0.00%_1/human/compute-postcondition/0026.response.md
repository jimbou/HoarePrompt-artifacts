The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, So for the loop to be executed one more time the original value of t needed to have been greater than 1 and t currently must be greater than 0.
State: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value and the original value of t must be greater than 1, n is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 inclusive, a is a list containing n integers: the first integer is 1000, and the remaining integers are the result of subtracting the corresponding element in T from the previous integer in a, but in reverse order, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each remaining test case, first an integer n (2 <= n <= 500) and then n-1 integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500), result is a string containing the elements of a in reverse order, separated by spaces, and this is printed: "[a[0]] [a[1]] ... [a[n-1]]"**
