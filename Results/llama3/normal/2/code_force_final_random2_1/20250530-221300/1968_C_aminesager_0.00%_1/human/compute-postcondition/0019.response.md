Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive and must be at least 2, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a list containing three integers: the first integer is 1000, the second integer is 1000 - T[0], and the third integer is 1000 - T[0] - T[1], `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each remaining test case, first an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 500) and then `n-1` integers `x_2,...,x_n` (1 <= `x_i` <= 500)**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains the same, `n` is still between 2 and 500, `T` is still a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` now has three elements: the first is 1000, the second is 1000 minus the first element of `T`, and the third is 1000 minus the first two elements of `T`. The value of `i` is still 2, and the stdin still contains multiple inputs for the remaining test cases.
