Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 500, `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a list containing four integers 1000, 1000 - T[0], 1000 - T[0] - T[1], and 1000 - T[0] - T[1] - T[2], `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each remaining test case, first an integer n (4 <= n <= 500) and then n-1 integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500)**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending a new element, which is the difference between the third last element of `a` (i.e., `a[i - 1]`) and the third element of `T` (i.e., `T[i - 1]`). The other variables remain unchanged.
