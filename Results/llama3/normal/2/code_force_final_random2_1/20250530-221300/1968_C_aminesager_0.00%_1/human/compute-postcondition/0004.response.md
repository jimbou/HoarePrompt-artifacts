Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive and greater than 1, `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a list containing two integers 1000 and 1000 - T[0], `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each remaining test case, first an integer n (2 <= n <= 500) and then n-1 integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500)**
