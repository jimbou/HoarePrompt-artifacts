To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Since `i` starts at 1, the loop will execute for `n-1` iterations.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value
* `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive and must be at least 2
* `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500 inclusive
* `a` is a list containing two integers: the first integer is 1000 and the second integer is 1000 - T[0]
* `i` is 1
* stdin contains multiple inputs: for each remaining test case, first an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 500) and then `n-1` integers `x_2,...,x_n` (1 <= `x_i` <= 500)

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, since the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, the new state is:

* `t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value (no change)
* `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive and must be at least 2 (no change)
* `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500 inclusive (no change)
* `a` is a list containing two integers: the first integer is 1000 and the second integer is 1000 - T[0] (no change)
* `i` is 2 (incremented by 1)
* stdin contains multiple inputs: for each remaining test case, first an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 500) and then `n-1` integers `x_2,...,x_n` (1 <= `x_i` <= 500) (no change)

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive and must be at least 2, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a list containing two integers: the first integer is 1000 and the second integer is 1000 - T[0], `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each remaining test case, first an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 500) and then `n-1` integers `x_2,...,x_n` (1 <= `x_i` <= 500)**
