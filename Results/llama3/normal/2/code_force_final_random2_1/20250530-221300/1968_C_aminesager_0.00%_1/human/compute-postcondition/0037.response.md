The code prints a string containing the elements of list `a` in reverse order, separated by spaces.

The list `a` contains `n` integers, where the first integer is 1000, and the remaining integers are the result of subtracting the corresponding element in list `T` from the previous integer in `a`, but in reverse order.

Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, and `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500 inclusive, the elements of `a` will be decreasing by the values in `T` in reverse order.

The value of `i` is `n-1`, which is used to access the last element of list `a`.

The `result` string is constructed by concatenating the elements of `a` in reverse order, separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be a string containing the elements of `a` in reverse order, separated by spaces, where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element in `T` from the previous integer in `a`, but in reverse order.

Output: **"[1000] [1000 - T[n-2]] [1000 - T[n-2] - T[n-3]] ... [1000 - T[n-2] - T[n-3] - ... - T[1]]" (where T[i] is the ith element of list T)**
