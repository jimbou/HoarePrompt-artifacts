Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive and must be at least 3, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a list containing four integers: the first integer is 1000, the second integer is 1000 - T[0], the third integer is 1000 - T[0] - T[1], and the fourth integer is 1000 - T[0] - T[1] - T[2], `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each remaining test case, first an integer `n` (3 <= `n` <= 500) and then `n-1` integers `x_2,...,x_n` (1 <= `x_i` <= 500)**.

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending a new integer, which is the difference between the third integer in `a` and the third integer in `T`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
