Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive, `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a list containing three integers 1000, 1000 - T[0], and 1000 - T[0] - T[1], `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each remaining test case, first an integer n (3 <= n <= 500) and then n-1 integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500)**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending a new integer calculated as `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`, where `i` is 2. This means the new integer is `1000 - T[0] - T[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple inputs for the remaining test cases.
