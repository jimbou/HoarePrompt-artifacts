Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is:

5
4
2 4 1

The program outputs:

3 5 4 9

However, this output does not satisfy the condition x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} for all 2 <= i <= n.

For instance, x_2 = 2, but a_2 mod a_1 = 5 mod 3 = 2, which is correct. However, x_3 = 4, but a_3 mod a_2 = 4 mod 5 = 4, which is correct. But x_4 = 1, but a_4 mod a_3 = 9 mod 4 = 1, which is incorrect because 9 mod 4 is actually 1, not 0.

This is because the program is not correctly implementing the condition x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} for all 2 <= i <= n. The program is simply subtracting the value of x_i from a_{i-1} to get a_i, which is not the correct way to satisfy the condition.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not work for all potential cases.
