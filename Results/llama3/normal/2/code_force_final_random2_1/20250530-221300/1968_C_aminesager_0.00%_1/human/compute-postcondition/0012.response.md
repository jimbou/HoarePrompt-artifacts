Based on the precondition, the `print(result)` statement will print the elements of the list `a` in reverse order, separated by spaces.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

* `a` is a list containing `n` integers, where each element is calculated as `1000 - sum(T)`, where `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500 inclusive.
* Since `i` is `n-1`, the last element of `a` is not included in the calculation.
* The `result` string is created by concatenating the elements of `a` in reverse order, separated by spaces.
* The `print(result)` statement will output the contents of the `result` string.

Since the exact values of `T` and `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in `a`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the elements of `a` in reverse order, separated by spaces.

Output: **elements of a in reverse order, separated by spaces (where a is a list containing n integers, each calculated as 1000 minus the sum of the corresponding elements in T)**
