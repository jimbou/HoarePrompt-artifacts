Output State: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a list containing n integers 1000, 1000 - T[0], 1000 - T[0] - T[1], ..., 1000 - sum(T), `i` is n-1, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each remaining test case, first an integer n (2 <= n <= 500) and then n-1 integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500)

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `t` remains non-negative, `n` is still between 2 and 500 inclusive, `T` remains a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 inclusive, `a` becomes a list of n integers where the first element is 1000 and each subsequent element is the previous element minus the corresponding element in `T`, `i` is now n-1, and the stdin remains unchanged.
