The variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than or equal to 0, So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 inclusive, a is a list containing n integers where each element is 1000 minus the sum of the corresponding elements in T, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each remaining test case, first an integer n (2 <= n <= 500) and then n-1 integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500), result is a string containing the elements of a in reverse order, separated by spaces, and result is printed**
