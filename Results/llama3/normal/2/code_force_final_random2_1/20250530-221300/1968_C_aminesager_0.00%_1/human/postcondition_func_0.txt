This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and n-1 integers x_2 to x_n. It then calculates a list of n integers, starting with 1000 and subtracting each x_i from the previous integer, and prints the resulting list in reverse order, separated by spaces. The function continues to read and process test cases until the initial input t, which represents the number of test cases, reaches 0.
