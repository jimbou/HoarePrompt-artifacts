Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 inclusive, a is a list containing a single integer 1000, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each remaining test case, first an integer n (2 <= n <= 500) and then n-1 integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive and greater than 1, `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a list containing two integers 1000 and 1000 - T[0], `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each remaining test case, first an integer n (2 <= n <= 500) and then n-1 integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500)

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive, `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a list containing three integers 1000, 1000 - T[0], and 1000 - T[0] - T[1], `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each remaining test case, first an integer n (3 <= n <= 500) and then n-1 integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500)

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 500, `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a list containing four integers 1000, 1000 - T[0], 1000 - T[0] - T[1], and 1000 - T[0] - T[1] - T[2], `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each remaining test case, first an integer n (4 <= n <= 500) and then n-1 integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
