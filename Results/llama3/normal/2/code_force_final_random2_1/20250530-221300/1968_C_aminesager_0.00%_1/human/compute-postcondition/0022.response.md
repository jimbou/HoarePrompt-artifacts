Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 inclusive, a is a list containing n integers: the first integer is 1000, and the remaining integers are the result of subtracting the corresponding element in T from the previous integer in a, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each remaining test case, first an integer n (2 <= n <= 500) and then n-1 integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500), result is not printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, `n` is still an integer between 2 and 500, and `T` is still a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500. The list `a` now contains `n` integers, where the first integer is 1000, and each subsequent integer is the result of subtracting the corresponding element in `T` from the previous integer in `a`. The value of `i` is now `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The state of `stdin` and the result remains unchanged.
