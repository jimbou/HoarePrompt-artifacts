Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the `n-1` integers `x_2, ..., x_n`.
3. It initializes the list `a` with the first element being 1000, which satisfies the condition `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`.
4. It then iterates over the remaining `n-1` elements and calculates the corresponding `a_i` values by subtracting the corresponding `x_i` value from the previous `a_i-1` value. This ensures that `x_i = a_i mod a_i-1` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`.
5. Finally, it reverses the list `a` and prints the resulting array.

The program correctly implements the logic to find any array `a_1, ..., a_n` that satisfies the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
