To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n`). 

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value and the original value of `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive and `n` must be at least 2, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a list containing `n` integers: the first integer is 1000, and the remaining integers are the result of subtracting the corresponding element in `T` from the previous integer in `a`, but in reverse order, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple inputs: for each remaining test case, first an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 500) and then `n-1` integers `x_2,...,x_n` (1 <= `x_i` <= 500), `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` in reverse order, separated by spaces, and this is printed: "[a[0]] [a[1]] ... [a[n-1]]"**
