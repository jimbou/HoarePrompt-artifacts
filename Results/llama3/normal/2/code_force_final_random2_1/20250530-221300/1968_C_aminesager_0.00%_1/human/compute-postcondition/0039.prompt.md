Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (2 <= n <= 500) and then n-1 integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500).
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t = t - 1
    n = int(input())
    line = input('')
    T = list(map(int, line.split()))
    a = [1000]
    for i in range(1, n):
        a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])
    a = a[::-1]
    result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 inclusive, a is a list containing n integers where each element is 1000 minus the sum of the corresponding elements in T, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each remaining test case, first an integer n (2 <= n <= 500) and then n-1 integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500), result is a string containing the elements of a in reverse order, separated by spaces, and result is printed
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 inclusive, a is a list containing n integers: the first integer is 1000, and the remaining integers are the result of subtracting the corresponding element in T from the previous integer in a, but in reverse order, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each remaining test case, first an integer n (2 <= n <= 500) and then n-1 integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500), result is a string containing the elements of a in reverse order, separated by spaces, and this is printed: "[a[0]] [a[1]] ... [a[n-1]]"
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value and the original value of t must be greater than 1, n is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 inclusive, a is a list containing n integers: the first integer is 1000, and the remaining integers are the result of subtracting the corresponding element in T from the previous integer in a, but in reverse order, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each remaining test case, first an integer n (2 <= n <= 500) and then n-1 integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500), result is a string containing the elements of a in reverse order, separated by spaces, and this is printed: "[a[0]] [a[1]] ... [a[n-1]]"


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
