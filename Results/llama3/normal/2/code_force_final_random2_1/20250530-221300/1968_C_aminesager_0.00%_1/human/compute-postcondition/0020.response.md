The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive and must be at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive and must be at least 3, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a list containing three integers: the first integer is 1000, the second integer is 1000 - T[0], and the third integer is 1000 - T[0] - T[1], `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each remaining test case, first an integer `n` (3 <= `n` <= 500) and then `n-1` integers `x_2,...,x_n` (1 <= `x_i` <= 500)**
