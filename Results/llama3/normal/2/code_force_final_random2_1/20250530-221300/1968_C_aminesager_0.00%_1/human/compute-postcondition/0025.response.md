The code prints the result string containing the elements of list a in reverse order, separated by spaces. Where a is a list containing n integers: the first integer is 1000, and the remaining integers are the result of subtracting the corresponding element in T from the previous integer in a, but in reverse order.
Output: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 inclusive, a is a list containing n integers: the first integer is 1000, and the remaining integers are the result of subtracting the corresponding element in T from the previous integer in a, but in reverse order, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each remaining test case, first an integer n (2 <= n <= 500) and then n-1 integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500), result is a string containing the elements of a in reverse order, separated by spaces, and this is printed: "[a[0]] [a[1]] ... [a[n-1]]"**
