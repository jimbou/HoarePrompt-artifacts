The `print(result)` statement will print the string `result`, which contains the elements of list `a` in reverse order, separated by spaces.

Since `a` is a list of `n` integers, where the first integer is 1000, and the remaining integers are the result of subtracting the corresponding element in `T` from the previous integer in `a`, but in reverse order, the output will be a string of `n` integers, separated by spaces.

The first integer in the output will be the last integer in `a`, which is the result of subtracting the last element in `T` from the second last integer in `a`. The second integer in the output will be the second last integer in `a`, which is the result of subtracting the second last element in `T` from the third last integer in `a`, and so on.

Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, the output will contain between 2 and 500 integers, separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be a string of `n` integers, separated by spaces, where each integer is the result of subtracting the corresponding element in `T` from the previous integer in `a`, but in reverse order.

Output: **a string of n integers, separated by spaces, where each integer is the result of subtracting the corresponding element in T from the previous integer in a, but in reverse order**
