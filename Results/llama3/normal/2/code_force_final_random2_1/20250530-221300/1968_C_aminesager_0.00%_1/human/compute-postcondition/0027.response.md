Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value and the original value of t must be greater than 1, n is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 inclusive, a is a list containing n integers: the first integer is 1000, and the remaining integers are the result of subtracting the corresponding element in T from the previous integer in a, but in reverse order, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each remaining test case, first an integer n (2 <= n <= 500) and then n-1 integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500), result is a string containing the elements of a in reverse order, separated by spaces, and this is printed: "[a[0]] [a[1]] ... [a[n-1]]"**

The code first decrements `t` by 1, making it two less than its original value. Then, it reads an integer `n` from stdin, which is between 2 and 500 inclusive. The next line reads `n-1` integers from stdin, which are between 1 and 500 inclusive, and stores them in the list `T`. The list `a` is initialized with the first element being 1000. The remaining elements of `a` are calculated by subtracting the corresponding element in `T` from the previous integer in `a`, but in reverse order. The variable `i` is set to `n-1`. The result is a string containing the elements of `a` in reverse order, separated by spaces, and this is printed.
