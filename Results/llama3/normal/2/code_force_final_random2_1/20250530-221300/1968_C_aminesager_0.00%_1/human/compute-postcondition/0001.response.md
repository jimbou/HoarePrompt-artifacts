The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute . Rigtht before the loop, t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), So for the loop to  executed the first time t must be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (2 <= n <= 500) and then n-1 integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500)**
