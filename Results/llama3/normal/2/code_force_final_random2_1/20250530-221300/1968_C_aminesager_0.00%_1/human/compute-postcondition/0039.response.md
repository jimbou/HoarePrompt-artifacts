Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 inclusive, a is a list containing n integers: the first integer is 1000, and the remaining integers are the result of subtracting the corresponding element in T from the previous integer in a, but in reverse order, i is n-1, stdin is empty, result is a string containing the elements of a in reverse order, separated by spaces, and this is printed: "[a[0]] [a[1]] ... [a[n-1]]"**

In natural language, this means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable t will be 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The variables n, T, a, and i will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop. The stdin will be empty, indicating that all input has been processed. The result will be a string containing the elements of a in reverse order, separated by spaces, and this will be printed.
