Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive and must be at least 2, `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a list containing two integers: the first integer is 1000 and the second integer is 1000 - T[0], `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each remaining test case, first an integer n (2 <= n <= 500) and then n-1 integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500), result is not printed.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending a new integer, which is the difference between the first element of `a` (1000) and the first element of `T` (T[0]). The other variables remain unchanged.
