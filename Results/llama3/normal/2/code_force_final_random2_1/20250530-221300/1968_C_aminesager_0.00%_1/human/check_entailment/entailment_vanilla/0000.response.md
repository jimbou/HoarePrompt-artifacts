Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by initializing the first element of the array `a` to 1000 and then iteratively calculating the subsequent elements as `a[i] = a[i-1] - T[i-1]`, where `T` is the input array. The array `a` is then reversed and printed as the result.

However, there are a few issues with this approach:

1. The initialization of `a[0]` to 1000 is arbitrary and does not guarantee that the resulting array will satisfy the conditions of the problem.
2. The calculation of `a[i]` as `a[i-1] - T[i-1]` does not take into account the condition that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}`. This calculation only ensures that `a_i` is less than `a_{i-1}`, but it does not guarantee that the remainder of `a_i` divided by `a_{i-1}` is equal to `x_i`.
3. The reversal of the array `a` at the end is unnecessary and does not affect the correctness of the solution.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find a way to construct the array `a` such that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` for all `i`. One possible approach is to start with `a_1` as an arbitrary value (e.g., 1) and then iteratively calculate `a_i` as `a_i = x_i + a_{i-1}`, which ensures that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}`.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect, and a correct solution would require a different approach.

Correctness: **False**
