Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the `n-1` integers `x_2` to `x_n`.
3. It initializes the list `a` with the first element being 1000, which satisfies the condition `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`.
4. It then calculates the remaining elements of `a` by subtracting each `x_i` from the previous element in `a`. This ensures that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`.
5. Finally, it prints the resulting list `a` in reverse order, separated by spaces, which satisfies the output format requirement.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles the input and output correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
