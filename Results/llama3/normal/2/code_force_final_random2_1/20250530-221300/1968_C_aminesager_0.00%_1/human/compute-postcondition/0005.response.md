The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive and greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive, `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a list containing two integers 1000 and 1000 - T[0], `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each remaining test case, first an integer n (3 <= n <= 500) and then n-1 integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500)**
