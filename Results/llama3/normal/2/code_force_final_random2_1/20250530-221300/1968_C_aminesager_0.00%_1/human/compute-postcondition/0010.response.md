Output State: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a list containing n integers 1000, 1000 - T[0], 1000 - T[0] - T[1], ..., 1000 - sum(T[:n-1]), `i` is n-1, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each remaining test case, first an integer n (2 <= n <= 500) and then n-1 integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500)

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` remains greater than or equal to 0, `n` remains an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `T` remains a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 inclusive, `a` becomes a list containing n integers where each element is 1000 minus the sum of the corresponding elements in `T`, `i` becomes n-1, and the stdin remains unchanged.
