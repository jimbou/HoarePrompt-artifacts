The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input integer to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple inputs, and the first input is an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). After this line of code is executed, the value of `t` is assigned, and the stdin contains the remaining inputs.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (2 <= n <= 500) and then n-1 integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500).**
