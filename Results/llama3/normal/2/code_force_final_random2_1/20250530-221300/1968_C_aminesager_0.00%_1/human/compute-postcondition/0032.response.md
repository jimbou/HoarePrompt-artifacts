The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive and `n` must be at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value and the original value of `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 4 and 500 inclusive and `n` must be at least 4, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500 inclusive, `a` is a list containing `n+1` integers: the first integer is 1000, and the remaining integers are the result of subtracting the corresponding element in `T` from the previous integer in `a`, but in reverse order, `i` is 3, `stdin` contains multiple inputs: for each remaining test case, first an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 500) and then `n-1` integers `x_2,...,x_n` (1 <= `x_i` <= 500), `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` in reverse order, separated by spaces, and this is printed: "[a[0]] [a[1]] ... [a[n-1]] [a[n]]", `a` has an additional element which is `a[1] - T[1]`.**
