Postcondition: **`loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` is an integer read from stdin, `iterable2` is `innerLoop-1`, `x` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is an integer read from stdin, `less`, `big`, and `no` are lists of integers with specific properties based on the value of `x`, `no` must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list `no`. The current value of `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in the list `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the list `big`.**
