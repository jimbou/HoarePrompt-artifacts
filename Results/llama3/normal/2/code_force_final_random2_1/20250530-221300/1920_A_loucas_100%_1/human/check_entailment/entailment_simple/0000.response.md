Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, including the number of constraints (n) and the constraints themselves (a and x).

2. It initializes three lists (less, big, and no) to store the constraints of type 2, type 1, and type 3, respectively.

3. It calculates the initial range of possible values for k by subtracting the maximum value of type 1 constraints from the minimum value of type 2 constraints and adding 1. This is correct because k must be greater than or equal to the maximum value of type 1 constraints and less than or equal to the minimum value of type 2 constraints.

4. If the initial range is less than 1, it means that there are no possible values for k that satisfy all constraints, so it prints 0 and continues to the next test case.

5. It then iterates over the type 3 constraints (no list) and for each constraint, it checks if the value is within the range of possible values for k. If it is, it decrements the count of possible values by 1.

6. Finally, it prints the count of possible values for k.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and edge cases, including the case where there are no possible values for k that satisfy all constraints.

Correctness: **True**
