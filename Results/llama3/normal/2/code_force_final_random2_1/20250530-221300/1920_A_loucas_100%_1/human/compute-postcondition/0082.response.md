Postcondition: ***loop is greater than 0, iterable is 1, innerLoop is an integer greater than or equal to 0, iterable2 is 0, x is an integer, a is an integer, num is an integer, i is undefined, stdin contains no input. If x is 1, big is a list containing one or more integers a and less and no are empty lists. If x is 2, less is a list containing one or more integers a and big and no are empty lists. If x is neither 1 nor 2, no is a list containing one or more integers a and less and big are empty lists. If num is less than 1, 0 is printed and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
