Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: loop is greater than 0, iterable is 1, innerLoop is an integer read from stdin, iterable2 is innerLoop-1, x is an integer read from stdin, a is an integer read from stdin, less is an empty list, big is an empty list, no is an empty list, num is 0, i is undefined.
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop-1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `num` is 0, `i` is undefined, stdin contains no input. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing one integer `a` and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `no` is a list containing one integer `a` and `less` and `big` are empty lists.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer greater than 1, `iterable2` is `innerLoop`, `x` is 3, `a` is 5, `num` is 0, `i` is undefined. If `x` is equal to 1, `no` is a list containing one integer 5, `less` is an empty list, `big` is a list containing one integer 5. If `x` is equal to 2, `no` is a list containing one integer 5, `less` is a list containing one integer 5, `big` is an empty list. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `no` is a list containing two integers 5, `less` and `big` are empty lists.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `num` is 0, `i` is undefined, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `no` is a list containing one integer 5 if `x` is equal to 1 or 2, `no` is a list containing two integers 5 if `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `less` is an empty list if `x` is equal to 1, `less` is a list containing one integer 5 if `x` is equal to 2, `less` is an empty list if `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `big` is a list containing one integer 5 if `x` is equal to 1, `big` is a list containing one integer 5 and one integer `a` if `x` is equal to 2, `big` is a list containing one integer `a` if `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers. If `x` is equal to 1, `big` is a list containing one integer 5. If `x` is equal to 2, `big` is a list containing one integer 5 and one integer `a`, and `less` is a list containing one integer 5 and `a`. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `big` is a list containing one integer `a`, and `less` is a list containing one integer `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
