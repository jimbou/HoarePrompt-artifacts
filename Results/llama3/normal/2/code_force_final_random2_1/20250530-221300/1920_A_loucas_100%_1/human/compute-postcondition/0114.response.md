Output State: **`loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 1, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is the last element in the list `no`, `no` is a list containing at least one integer `a`, `less` and `big` are lists, `stdin` contains no input. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing one element, which is the value of `a`, and `less` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `big` is an empty list. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `less` and `big` are empty lists.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `loop`, `iterable`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, `num`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged. The list `no` now contains at least one integer `a`. The list `less` and `big` are lists, but their contents depend on the value of `x`. If `x` is 1, `big` contains the value of `a` and `less` is empty. If `x` is 2, `less` contains the value of `a` and `big` is empty. If `x` is not 1 or 2, both `less` and `big` are empty. The value of `i` is updated to be the last element in the list `no`. There is no input in `stdin`.
