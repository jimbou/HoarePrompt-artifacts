Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *loop is greater than 0, iterable is 1, innerLoop is an integer greater than or equal to 0, iterable2 is 0, x is an integer, a is an integer, num is an integer, i is undefined, stdin contains no input. If x is 1, big is a list containing one or more integers a and less and no are empty lists. If x is 2, less is a list containing one or more integers a and big and no are empty lists. If x is neither 1 nor 2, no is a list containing one or more integers a and less and big are empty lists. If num is less than 1, 0 is printed and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in no:
    if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
        num -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `a` is an integer, `num` is at least 0, `i` is the first element in the list `no`, `no` is a list containing one or more integers `a`, `big` and `less` are empty lists, `stdin` contains no input. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in the list `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the list `big`, then the current value of `i` satisfies this condition. Otherwise, no specific condition is met.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `a` is an integer, `num` is at least -1, `i` is the second element in the list `no`, `no` is a list containing two or more integers, `big` and `less` are empty lists, `stdin` contains no input. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in the list `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the list `big`, then the current value of `i` satisfies this condition. Otherwise, no specific condition is met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `a` is an integer, `num` is at least -2, `i` is the third element in the list `no`, `no` is a list containing three or more integers, `big` and `less` are empty lists, `stdin` contains no input. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in the list `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the list `big`, then the current value of `i` satisfies this condition. Otherwise, no specific condition is met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
