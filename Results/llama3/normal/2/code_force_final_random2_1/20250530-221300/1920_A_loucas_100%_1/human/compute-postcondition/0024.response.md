Output State: **`loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 3, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `less` is either an empty list or a list containing a single integer which is the value of `a`, `big` is a list containing either one or two integers which are the value of `a`, `no` is either an empty list or a list containing a single element which is the value of `a`, and `num` is 0.**

The value of `less` has been updated to include the value of `a` as its last element. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains no input as two integers have been accepted from the input and assigned to `x` and `a`.
