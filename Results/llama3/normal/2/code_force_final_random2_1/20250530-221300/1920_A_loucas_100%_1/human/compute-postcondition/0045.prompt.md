Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *loop is greater than 0, iterable is 0, innerLoop is an integer read from stdin, iterable2 is innerLoop-1, x is an integer read from stdin, a is an integer read from stdin, less, big, and no are lists of integers with specific properties based on the value of x. If the current value of num is less than 1, 0 is printed and the rest of the current iteration is skipped, moving to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statement.
Code of the loop:
for i in no:
    if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
        num -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` is an integer read from stdin, `iterable2` is `innerLoop-1`, `x` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is an integer read from stdin, `less`, `big`, and `no` are lists of integers with specific properties based on the value of `x`, `no` must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list `no`. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in the list `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the list `big`, then `num` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` is an integer read from stdin, `iterable2` is `innerLoop-1`, `x` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is an integer read from stdin, `less`, `big`, and `no` are lists of integers with specific properties based on the value of `x`, `no` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list `no`. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then `num` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` is an integer read from stdin, `iterable2` is `innerLoop-1`, `x` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is an integer read from stdin, `less`, `big`, and `no` are lists of integers with specific properties based on the value of `x`, `no` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list `no`. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then `num` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
