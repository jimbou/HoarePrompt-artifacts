The code `big.append(a)` adds the value of `a` to the end of the list `big`. Since `a` is an integer and `big` is initially an empty list, the new value of `big` will be a list containing a single integer, which is the value of `a`.

The other variables are not affected by this code, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is a list containing a single integer which is the value of `a`, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable2` is 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is 1, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.**
