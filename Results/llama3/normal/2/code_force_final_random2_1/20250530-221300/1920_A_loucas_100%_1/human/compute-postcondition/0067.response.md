Postcondition: ***`loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer greater than 1, `iterable2` is `innerLoop`, `x` is 3, `a` is 5, `num` is 0, `i` is undefined. If `x` is equal to 1, `no` is a list containing one integer 5, `less` is an empty list, `big` is a list containing one integer 5. If `x` is equal to 2, `no` is a list containing one integer 5, `less` is a list containing one integer 5, `big` is an empty list. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `no` is a list containing two integers 5, `less` and `big` are empty lists.***
