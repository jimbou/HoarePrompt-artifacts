Output State: **`loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 2, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is the last element in the list `no`, `stdin` contains no input. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing three elements, which are the value of `a`, and `no` and `less` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `no` and `big` are empty lists. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `no` is a list containing at least one integer `a`, `less` and `big` are lists and `big` contains one more element which is `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `big` has been updated by appending the value of `a` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `big` now depends on the value of `x`. If `x` is 1, `big` contains three elements, which are the value of `a`. If `x` is 2, `big` is still empty. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `big` contains one more element which is `a`.
