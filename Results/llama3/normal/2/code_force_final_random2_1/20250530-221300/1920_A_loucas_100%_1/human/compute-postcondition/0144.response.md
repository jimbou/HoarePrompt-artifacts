Output: **`loop` is greater than or equal to 1, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is the last element in the list `no`, `no` is a list containing at least one integer `a`, `less` is a list containing at least one integer `a`, `big` is a list containing at least one integer `a`, `stdin` contains no input. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in the list `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the list `big`, then `num` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `num` remains unchanged. The value of `num` is being printed**
