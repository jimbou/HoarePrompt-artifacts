Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: loop is greater than 1, iterable is 2, innerLoop is an integer greater than or equal to 0, iterable2 is 0, x is neither 1 nor 2, a is an integer, num is 0, i is the last element in the list no, no is an empty list, less is an empty list, big is an empty list, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable2` is 0, `num` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `no`, `stdin` contains no input. If `x` is 1, `x` is 1, `a` is an integer, `big` is a list containing one element, which is the value of `a`, and `no` and `less` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `no` and `big` are empty lists. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `no` is a list containing one integer `a` and `less` and `big` are empty lists.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 1, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is the last element in the list `no`, `stdin` contains no input. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing two elements, which are the value of `a`, and `no` and `less` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `no` and `big` are empty lists. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `no` is a list containing at least one integer `a`, `less` and `big` are lists.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 2, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing three elements, which are the value of `a`, and `no` and `less` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing two integers `a`, and `no` and `big` are empty lists. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `no` is a list containing at least one integer `a`, `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `big` is a list containing one more element which is `a`. `i` is the last element in the list `no` if `x` is 1, otherwise `i` is the last element in the list `no` if `x` is 2, otherwise `i` is the second last element in the list `no`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
