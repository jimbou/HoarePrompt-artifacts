Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *loop is greater than 1, iterable is 2, innerLoop is an integer greater than or equal to 0, iterable2 is innerLoop, x is an integer, a is an integer, i is the last element in the list no, no is a list containing at least one integer a, less is a list containing at least one integer a, big is a list containing at least one integer a, stdin contains no input. If num is less than 1, we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues to execute the remaining code inside the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in no:
    if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
        num -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is the first element in the list `no`, `no` is a list containing at least one integer `a`, `less` is a list containing at least one integer `a`, `big` is a list containing at least one integer `a`, `stdin` contains no input. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in the list `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the list `big`, then `num` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is the second element in the list `no`, `no` is a list containing at least two integers, `less` is a list containing at least one integer `a`, `big` is a list containing at least one integer `a`, `stdin` contains no input. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in the list `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the list `big`, then `num` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is the third element in the list `no`, `no` is a list containing at least three integers, `less` is a list containing at least one integer `a`, `big` is a list containing at least one integer `a`, `stdin` contains no input. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in the list `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the list `big`, then `num` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `num` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
