Output State: **loop is greater than 0, iterable is 0, innerLoop is an integer read from stdin, iterable2 is innerLoop-1, x is an integer read from stdin, a is an integer read from stdin, less, big, and no are lists of integers with specific properties based on the value of x. The current value of num is less than 1, and 0 is being printed, and we skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the most internal loop.**

In this output state, the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state, but the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the most internal loop due to the `continue` statement.
