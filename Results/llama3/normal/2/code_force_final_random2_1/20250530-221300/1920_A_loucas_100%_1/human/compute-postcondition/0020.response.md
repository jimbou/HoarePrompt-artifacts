Postcondition: ***`loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer. If `x` is equal to 1, then `less` is either an empty list or a list containing a single integer which is the value of `a`, `big` is a list containing either one or two integers which are the value of `a`, `no` is either an empty list or a list containing a single element which is the value of `a`, and `num` is 0. If `x` is equal to 2, then `less` is either a list containing one integer element or a list containing two integer elements, `big` is either a list containing one integer which is the value of `a` or an empty list, `no` is either an empty list or an empty list, and `num` is 0. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, then `less` is either an empty list or a list containing a single integer element which is the value of `a`, `big` is either a list containing one integer which is the value of `a` or an empty list, `no` contains either a single element which is the value of `a` or two elements which are the value of `a`, and `num` is 0.***
