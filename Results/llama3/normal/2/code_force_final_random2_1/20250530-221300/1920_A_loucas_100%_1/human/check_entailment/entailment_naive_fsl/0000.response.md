Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It first initializes three lists to store the constraints of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x), and type 3 (k must be not equal to x). It then iterates over the constraints, updating the lists accordingly.

After processing all constraints, it calculates the range of possible values for k by subtracting the maximum value of type 1 constraints from the minimum value of type 2 constraints and adding 1. If this range is less than 1, it prints 0, indicating that there are no possible values for k.

Otherwise, it iterates over the type 3 constraints and subtracts 1 from the range for each constraint that falls within the range. This correctly accounts for the constraints that k must not be equal to certain values.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where the range of possible values is empty or where there are no type 3 constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
