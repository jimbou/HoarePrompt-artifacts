Postcondition: ***loop is greater than 1, iterable is 2, innerLoop is an integer greater than or equal to 0, iterable2 is innerLoop, x is an integer, a is an integer, i is the last element in the list no, no is a list containing at least one integer a, less is a list containing at least one integer a, big is a list containing at least one integer a, stdin contains no input. If num is less than 1, we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues to execute the remaining code inside the loop.***
