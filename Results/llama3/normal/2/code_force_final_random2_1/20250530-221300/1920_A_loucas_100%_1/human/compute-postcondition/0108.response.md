Postcondition: ***`loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `num` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `no`, `stdin` contains no input. If `x` is equal to 2, `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is not equal to 2, `no` is a list containing one integer `a` and `less` is an empty list.***
