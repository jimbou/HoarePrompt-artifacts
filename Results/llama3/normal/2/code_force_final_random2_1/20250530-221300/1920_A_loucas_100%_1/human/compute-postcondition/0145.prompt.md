Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `loop` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains the remaining input for the current test case, which consists of `loop` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `x`.
Code of the loop:
for iterable in range(loop):
    less = []
    big = []
    no = []
    num = 0
    innerLoop = int(input())
    for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
        x, a = map(int, input().split())
        if x == 1:
            big.append(a)
        elif x == 2:
            less.append(a)
        else:
            no.append(a)
    num = min(less) - max(big) + 1
    if num < 1:
        print(0)
        continue
    for i in no:
        if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
            num -= 1
    print(num)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: loop is 0, iterable is 0, innerLoop is an integer read from stdin, iterable2 is innerLoop-1, x is an integer read from stdin, a is an integer read from stdin, less, big, and no are lists of integers with specific properties based on the value of x, no is an empty list, i is undefined, and the value of num is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: loop is greater than 0, iterable is 1, innerLoop is an integer greater than or equal to 0, iterable2 is 0, x is neither 1 nor 2, a is an integer, num is at least -len(no), i is the last element in the list no, no is a list containing one or more integers a, big and less are empty lists, stdin contains no input. If i is less than or equal to the minimum value in the list less and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the list big, then the current value of i satisfies this condition. Otherwise, no specific condition is met., and the value of num which is at least -len(no) is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `loop` is greater than or equal to 1, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is the last element in the list `no`, `no` is a list containing at least one integer `a`, `less` is a list containing at least one integer `a`, `big` is a list containing at least one integer `a`, `stdin` contains no input. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in the list `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the list `big`, then `num` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `num` remains unchanged. The value of `num` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
