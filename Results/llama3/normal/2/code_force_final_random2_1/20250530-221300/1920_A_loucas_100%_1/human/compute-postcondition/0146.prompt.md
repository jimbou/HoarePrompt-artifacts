You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n lines, each containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9).
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        
        big = []
        
        no = []
        
        num = 0
        
        innerLoop = int(input())
        
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            x, a = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        
        num = min(less) - max(big) + 1
        
        if num < 1:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        for i in no:
            if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
                num -= 1
        
        print(num)
        
    #State: loop is 0, iterable is loop-1, innerLoop is an integer greater than or equal to 0, iterable2 is innerLoop, x is an integer, a is an integer, i is the last element in the list no, no is a list containing one or more integers a, less is a list containing one or more integers a, big is a list containing one or more integers a, stdin contains no input. If i is less than or equal to the minimum value in the list less and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the list big, then num is decreased by 1. Otherwise, num remains unchanged. The value of num is being printed.

```

Return Postconditions: loop is 0, iterable is loop-1, innerLoop is an integer greater than or equal to 0, iterable2 is innerLoop, x is an integer, a is an integer, i is the last element in the list no, no is a list containing one or more integers a, less is a list containing one or more integers a, big is a list containing one or more integers a, stdin contains no input. If i is less than or equal to the minimum value in the list less and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the list big, then num is decreased by 1. Otherwise, num remains unchanged. The value of num is being printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
