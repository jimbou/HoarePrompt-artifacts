Postcondition: ***`loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` is an integer read from stdin, `iterable2` is `innerLoop-1`, `x` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is an integer read from stdin, `less`, `big`, and `no` are lists of integers with specific properties based on the value of `x`, `no` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list `no`. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then `num` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
