Output State: **`loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 2, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is the second last element in the list `no`, `no` contains at least two integers including `a`, `stdin` contains no input. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing two elements, which are the value of `a`, and `less` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `big` is an empty list. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `less` is a list.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has changed to the second last element in the list `no` because `a` has been appended to `no`. The value of `no` has also changed to contain at least two integers including `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
