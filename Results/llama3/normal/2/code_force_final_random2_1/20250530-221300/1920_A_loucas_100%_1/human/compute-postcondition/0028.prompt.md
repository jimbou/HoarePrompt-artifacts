Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: loop is greater than 0, iterable is 0, less is an empty list, big is an empty list, no is an empty list, num is 0, innerLoop is an integer read from stdin, stdin contains no inputs.
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *loop is greater than 0, iterable is 0, innerLoop is at least 1, iterable2 is 0, a is an integer, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers. If x is equal to 1, then less is an empty list, big is a list containing a single integer which is the value of a, no is an empty list, and num is 0. If x is equal to 2, then less is a list containing one integer element, big is an empty list, no is an empty list, and num is 0. If x is not equal to 1 or 2, then less is an empty list, big is an empty list, no contains a single element which is the value of a, and num is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer. If `x` is equal to 1, then `less` is either an empty list or a list containing a single integer which is the value of `a`, `big` is a list containing either one or two integers which are the value of `a`, `no` is either an empty list or a list containing a single element which is the value of `a`, and `num` is 0. If `x` is equal to 2, then `less` is either a list containing one integer element or a list containing two integer elements, `big` is either a list containing one integer which is the value of `a` or an empty list, `no` is either an empty list or an empty list, and `num` is 0. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, then `less` is either an empty list or a list containing a single integer element which is the value of `a`, `big` is either a list containing one integer which is the value of `a` or an empty list, `no` contains either a single element which is the value of `a` or two elements which are the value of `a`, and `num` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 3, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer. If `x` is equal to 1, then `less` is either an empty list or a list containing a single integer which is the value of `a`, `big` is a list containing either two or three integers which are the value of `a`, `no` is either an empty list or a list containing a single element which is the value of `a`, and `num` is 0. If `x` is equal to 2, then `less` is either a list containing one integer element or a list containing two integer elements, `big` is either a list containing two integers which are the value of `a` or a list containing one integer which is the value of `a`, `no` is either an empty list or an empty list, and `num` is 0. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, then `less` is either an empty list or a list containing a single integer element which is the value of `a`, `big` is either a list containing two integers which are the value of `a` or a list containing one integer which is the value of `a`, `no` contains either a single element which is the value of `a` or two elements which are the value of `a`, and `num` is 0. `x` and `a` are assigned the values of two integers from the input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
