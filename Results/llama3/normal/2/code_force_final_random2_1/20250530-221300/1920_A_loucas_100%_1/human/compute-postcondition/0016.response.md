Output State: **`loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, if `x` is equal to 1, then `less` is an empty list, `big` is a list containing two integers which are the value of `a`, `no` is an empty list, and `num` is 0. If `x` is equal to 2, then `less` is a list containing one integer element, `big` is a list containing one integer which is the value of `a`, `no` is an empty list, and `num` is 0. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, then `less` is an empty list, `big` is a list containing one integer which is the value of `a`, `no` contains a single element which is the value of `a`, and `num` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is that the values of `loop`, `iterable`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged. The list `big` now contains an additional element which is the value of `a`. The other lists `less`, `no`, and `num` remain unchanged. The conditions on `x` and the corresponding values of `less`, `big`, `no`, and `num` are still valid.
