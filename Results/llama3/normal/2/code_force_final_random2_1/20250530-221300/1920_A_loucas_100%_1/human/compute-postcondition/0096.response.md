Output: **loop is greater than 0, iterable is 1, innerLoop is an integer greater than or equal to 0, iterable2 is 0, x is neither 1 nor 2, a is an integer, num is at least -len(no), i is the last element in the list no, no is a list containing one or more integers a, big and less are empty lists, stdin contains no input. If i is less than or equal to the minimum value in the list less and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the list big, then the current value of i satisfies this condition. Otherwise, no specific condition is met., and the value of num which is at least -len(no) is being printed**
