Output State: **`loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `num` is 0, `i` is undefined, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `no` is a list containing one integer 5 and `a` if `x` is equal to 1 or 2, `no` is a list containing two integers 5 and `a` if `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `less` is an empty list if `x` is equal to 1, `less` is a list containing one integer 5 if `x` is equal to 2, `less` is an empty list if `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `big` is a list containing one integer 5 if `x` is equal to 1, `big` is an empty list if `x` is equal to 2, `big` is an empty list if `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `no` has been updated to include the value of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
