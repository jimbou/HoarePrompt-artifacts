This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n lines of two integers each. It categorizes the integers into three lists based on their values, calculates the range of possible values between the minimum of one list and the maximum of another, and then subtracts the count of integers from the third list that fall within this range. The function prints the resulting count for each test case.
