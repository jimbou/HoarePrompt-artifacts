Postcondition: ***`loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop-1`, `x` is an integer not equal to 1, `a` is an integer, `num` is 0, `i` is undefined, stdin contains no input. If `x` is equal to 2, `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not equal to 2, `no` is a list containing one integer `a` and `less` and `big` are empty lists.***
