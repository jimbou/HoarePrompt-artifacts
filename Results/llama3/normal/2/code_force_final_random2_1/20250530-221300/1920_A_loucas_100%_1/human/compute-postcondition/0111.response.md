Output State: **`loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 1, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is the last element in the list `no`, `stdin` contains no input. If `x` is 1, `x` is 1, `a` is an integer, `big` is a list containing one element, which is the value of `a`, and `no` and `less` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `no` and `big` are empty lists. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `no` is a list containing one integer `a` and `less` and `big` are empty lists.**

In this output state, the values of `loop`, `iterable`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, and `num` remain unchanged. The values of `x` and `a` are updated to the integers read from the input. The value of `i` is still the last element in the list `no`. The stdin is empty since it contained no input initially. The values of `big`, `no`, and `less` are updated based on the value of `x`. If `x` is 1, `big` contains the value of `a`, and `no` and `less` are empty. If `x` is 2, `less` contains the value of `a`, and `no` and `big` are empty. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` contains the value of `a`, and `less` and `big` are empty.
