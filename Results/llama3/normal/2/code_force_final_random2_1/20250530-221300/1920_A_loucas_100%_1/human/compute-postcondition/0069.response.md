Output State: **`loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `num` is 0, `i` is undefined, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `no` is a list containing one integer 5 if `x` is equal to 1 or 2, `no` is a list containing two integers 5 if `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `less` is an empty list if `x` is equal to 1, `less` is a list containing one integer 5 if `x` is equal to 2, `less` is an empty list if `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `big` is a list containing one integer 5 if `x` is equal to 1, `big` is an empty list if `x` is equal to 2, `big` is an empty list if `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.**

The values of `loop`, `iterable`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, `num`, and `i` are not affected by the code. The values of `x` and `a` are updated to the integers from the input. The values of `no`, `less`, and `big` are updated based on the value of `x`. The stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.
