The only variables in the loop head are variables  iterable and loop, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `loop`. If loop is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, loop is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `loop` is greater than 0 and iterable is now 0. 
State: **`loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 0**
