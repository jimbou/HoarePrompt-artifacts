Output State: **`loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop-1`, `x` is 1, `a` is an integer, `less` is an empty list, `big` is a list containing one integer `a`, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `i` is undefined, stdin contains no input.**

The code `big.append(a)` adds the value of `a` to the end of the list `big`. Since `big` was initially an empty list, it now contains one element, which is the integer `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
