Postcondition: ***loop is greater than 0, iterable is 0, innerLoop is at least 1, iterable2 is 0, a is an integer, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers. If x is equal to 2, then less is a list containing one integer element, big is an empty list, no is an empty list, and num is 0. If x is not equal to 2, then less is an empty list, big is an empty list, no contains a single element which is the value of a, and num is 0.***
