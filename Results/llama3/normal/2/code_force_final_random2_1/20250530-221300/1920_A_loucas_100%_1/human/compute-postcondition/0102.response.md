The code `big.append(a)` adds the value of `a` to the end of the list `big`. Since `big` is initially an empty list, it will now contain one element, which is the value of `a`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is 1, `a` is an integer, `num` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `no`, `no` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `big` is a list containing one element, which is the value of `a`, `stdin` contains no input.**
