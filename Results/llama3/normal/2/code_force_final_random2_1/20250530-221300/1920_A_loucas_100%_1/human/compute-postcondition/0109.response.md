Postcondition: ***`loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable2` is 0, `num` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `no`, `stdin` contains no input. If `x` is 1, `x` is 1, `a` is an integer, `big` is a list containing one element, which is the value of `a`, and `no` and `less` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `no` and `big` are empty lists. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `no` is a list containing one integer `a` and `less` and `big` are empty lists.***
