Output State: **`loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer greater than 1, `iterable2` is `innerLoop`, `x` is 3, `a` is 5, `num` is 0, `i` is undefined, `no` is a list containing one integer 5, `less` is an empty list, `big` is a list containing one integer 5.**

In this output state, the code has appended the value of `a` (which is 5) to the list `big`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `big` now contains one integer, which is 5.
