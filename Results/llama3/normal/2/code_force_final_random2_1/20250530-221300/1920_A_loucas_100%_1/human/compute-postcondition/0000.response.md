The code `loop = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `loop`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case starts with a single integer `n`. This integer `n` is assigned to the variable `loop`. The value of `n` is between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and the remaining input for each test case consists of `n` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `x`.

Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains the remaining input for the current test case, which consists of `loop` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `x`.**
