Postcondition: ***loop is greater than 0, iterable is 0, innerLoop is an integer read from stdin, iterable2 is innerLoop-1, x is an integer read from stdin, a is an integer read from stdin, less, big, and no are lists of integers with specific properties based on the value of x. If the current value of num is less than 1, 0 is printed and the rest of the current iteration is skipped, moving to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statement.***
