Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer, costs is a list containing two elements: n - k + 1 and 1, i is 1, h is the sum of the integer division of n by 1 and the original value of h plus the integer division of n by 1 plus the integer division of n by i.**

The code block modifies the values of `n` and `h`. The first line assigns the integer division of `n` by `i` to `curr`. Since `i` is 1, `curr` becomes equal to `n`. The second line increments `h` by the value of `curr`, which is `n`. The third line subtracts the product of `i` and `curr` from `n`, effectively setting `n` to 0.

The final state includes the original values of `k` and `costs`, which remain unchanged. The value of `i` also remains unchanged. The value of `h` is updated to include the additional term `n // i`, which is equal to `n` since `i` is 1. The value of `n` is updated to 0.
