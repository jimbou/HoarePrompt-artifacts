Correctness: **False**

Reasoning:

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires finding a way to set up at most 60 stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, but the program does not provide a correct solution.

In the case where n is not equal to k, the program checks if n is less than k and prints "NO" if true. However, this is not sufficient to determine if it is impossible to set up the stalls to make Alice buy exactly k jewels. The program should also consider the case where n is greater than or equal to k.

In the case where n is greater than or equal to k, the program calculates the costs of the stalls and checks if the total number of jewels bought is less than k. If true, it prints "NO". However, this is not correct because the program does not consider the case where the total number of jewels bought is greater than or equal to k.

Moreover, the program prints "YES" and the number 2, but it does not provide the correct prices for the stalls. The program should print the prices for the stalls that make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not provide a correct solution to the problem.
