To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for i in costs:`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0
* `k` is an integer
* `costs` is a list containing two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`
* `i` is 1
* `h` is the sum of the integer division of `n` by 1 and the original value of `h` plus the integer division of `n` by 1

Since the loop iterates over the `costs` list, we need to consider the state of the list and the index `i`. The list `costs` has two elements, and `i` is currently 1, which means we've already processed the first element.

For the loop to execute again, we need to move to the next element in the list. Since `costs` has only two elements, the next element would be the second element, which is `1`.

So, the adjusted states are:

* `n` remains the same (no change)
* `k` remains the same (no change)
* `costs` remains the same (no change)
* `i` is now 1 (moved to the next element in the list)
* `h` remains the same (no change)

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `costs` is a list containing two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`, `i` is 1, `h` is the sum of the integer division of `n` by 1 and the original value of `h` plus the integer division of `n` by 1**
