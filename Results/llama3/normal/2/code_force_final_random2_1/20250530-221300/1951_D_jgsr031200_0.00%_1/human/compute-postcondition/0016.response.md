Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer, costs is a list containing two elements: n - k + 1 and 1 that must have at least 1 element, i is the first element in the list, h is the sum of the integer division of n by i and the original value of h**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been reduced by the product of `i` and the integer division of `n` by `i`, which is equivalent to the largest multiple of `i` that is less than or equal to `n`. The value of `h` has been incremented by the integer division of `n` by `i`, which is the number of times `i` fits into `n`. The values of `k`, `costs`, and `i` remain unchanged.
