Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer, costs is an empty list, i is 1, h is the sum of the integer division of n by 1 and the original value of h plus the integer division of n by 1 plus the integer division of n by i.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` will be 0, `k` will remain unchanged, the `costs` list will be empty, `i` will be 1, and `h` will be the sum of the integer division of `n` by 1 and the original value of `h`, plus the integer division of `n` by 1, plus the integer division of `n` by `i`.
