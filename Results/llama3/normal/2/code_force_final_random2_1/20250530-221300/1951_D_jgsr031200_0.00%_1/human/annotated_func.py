If h is less than k, 'NO' is printed. If h is greater than or equal to k, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and an empty list is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether it is possible to reach a target value `k` by subtracting a sequence of decreasing integers from a given number `n`. If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES' and 1 twice. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates the minimum number of subtractions required to reach `k` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. If the minimum number of subtractions is 2, it prints 2 and 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.
