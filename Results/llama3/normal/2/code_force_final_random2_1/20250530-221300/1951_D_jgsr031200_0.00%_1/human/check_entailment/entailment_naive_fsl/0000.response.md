Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when n = 7 and k = 3, the program prints "YES" and the costs [5, 1], but this is not a valid solution because Alice will buy 1 jewel at the first stall and be left with 2 coins, which is not enough to buy any jewels at the second stall.

A correct solution would be to print "YES" and the costs [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] as shown in the example output.

The issue with the program is that it only considers two stalls, but the problem statement allows for up to 60 stalls. The program also does not correctly calculate the number of jewels Alice will buy at each stall.

To fix the program, it needs to be modified to consider all possible stall configurations and correctly calculate the number of jewels Alice will buy at each stall.
