To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for i in costs:`, which means the loop will iterate over the elements in the `costs` list.

The current state is:

* `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0
* `k` is an integer
* `costs` is a list containing two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1` that must have at least 1 element
* `i` is the first element in the list
* `h` is the sum of the integer division of `n` by `i` and the original value of `h`

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what would happen if the loop were to execute again. Since the loop iterates over the elements in the `costs` list, the next iteration would start with the next element in the list.

Since `i` is currently the first element in the list, the next iteration would start with the second element in the list, which is `1`.

The other variables in the loop head, `n`, `k`, and `costs`, do not change based on the iteration. However, the value of `h` depends on the value of `i`, so it would change in the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

* `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 (no change)
* `k` is an integer (no change)
* `costs` is a list containing two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1` that must have at least 1 element (no change)
* `i` is the second element in the list, which is `1`
* `h` is the sum of the integer division of `n` by `1` and the original value of `h`

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `costs` is a list containing two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1` that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 1, `h` is the sum of the integer division of `n` by 1 and the original value of `h`**
