Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to k, k is an integer, costs is a list containing two elements: n - k + 1 and 1, h is 0**

The code assigns the value of `n - k + 1` to the first element of the list `costs` and the value of `1` to the second element of the list `costs`. The value of `h` is set to `0`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
