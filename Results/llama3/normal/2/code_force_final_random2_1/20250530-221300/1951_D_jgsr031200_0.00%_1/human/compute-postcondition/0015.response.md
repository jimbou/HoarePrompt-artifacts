The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list costs, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list costs. If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer greater than or equal to k, k is an integer, h is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the i is the first element in the list.
State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to k, k is an integer, costs is a list containing two elements: n - k + 1 and 1 that must have at least 1 element, i is the first element in the list, h is 0**
