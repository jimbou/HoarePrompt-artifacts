Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `empty` is False, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers where 1 <= u, v <= n, `tree` is a deque with `v` as the first element, stdin contains n-4 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u, where 1 <= u <= n.**

In this output state, the value of `tree` has been updated by appending `v` to the left of the deque. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains the same input as before, with n-4 lines of two integers u and v, and a final integer u.
