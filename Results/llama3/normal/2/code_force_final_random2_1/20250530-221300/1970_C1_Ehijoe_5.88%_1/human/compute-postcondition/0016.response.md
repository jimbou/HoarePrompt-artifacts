Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque with an additional element `v` at the end, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are integers where 1 <= u, v <= n, stdin contains n-3 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u, where 1 <= u <= n. The current value of `u` is not equal to the last element of `tree`, and `u` is not equal to the first element of `tree`.**

In this output state, the value of `tree` has been updated by appending the value of `v` to the end of the deque. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains n-3 lines of input, each with two integers u and v, and finally one integer u. The relationship between `u` and the elements of `tree` has also been updated, with `u` no longer being equal to the last element of `tree`, but still not equal to the first element of `tree`.
