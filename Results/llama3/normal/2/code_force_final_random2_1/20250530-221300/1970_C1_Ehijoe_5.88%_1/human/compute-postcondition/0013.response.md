Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque with at least two elements, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are integers where 1 <= u, v <= n, stdin contains n-3 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u, where 1 <= u <= n, and `v` is not equal to the last element of `tree`. The current value of `u` is equal to the second element of `tree` and `v` is the first element of `tree`.**

In this output state, the value of `tree` has been updated by appending `v` to the left of the deque, and the value of `u` is now equal to the second element of `tree`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains n-3 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u, where 1 <= u <= n, and `v` is not equal to the last element of `tree`.
