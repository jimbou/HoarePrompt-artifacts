Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `empty` is False, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers where 1 <= u, v <= n, stdin contains n-4 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u, where 1 <= u <= n. If `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with `v` as the first element. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` is updated by appending `v` to it. Otherwise, `tree` remains unchanged.**
