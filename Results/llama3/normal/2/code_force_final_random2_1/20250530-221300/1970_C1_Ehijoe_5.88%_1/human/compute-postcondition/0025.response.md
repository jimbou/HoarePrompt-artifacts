Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `empty` is False, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers where 1 <= u, v <= n, stdin contains n-4 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u, where 1 <= u <= n. If `empty` was True, then `tree` is a deque containing three integers u, u and v. If `empty` was False, then `tree` is updated based on the values of `u` and `v` as follows: if `v` is equal to the second element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with at least three elements. If `v` is equal to the second last element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with at least three elements. If `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with at least three elements, `u` is equal to the second element of `tree` and `v` is the first element of `tree`. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with an additional element `v` at the end and an additional element `u` at the beginning. Otherwise, `tree` remains unchanged but with an additional element `u` at the beginning.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `t`, `empty`, `i`, `u`, and `v` remains the same as in the initial state. The stdin also remains the same. However, the `tree` deque has been updated by adding the value of `u` at the beginning. If `empty` was True, then `tree` now contains three integers `u`, `u`, and `v`. If `empty` was False, then the update of `tree` depends on the values of `u` and `v`. If `v` is equal to the second element of `tree`, then `tree` now has at least three elements. If `v` is equal to the second last element of `tree`, then `tree` now has at least three elements. If `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` now has at least three elements, `u` is equal to the second element of `tree` and `v` is the first element of `tree`. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` now has an additional element `v` at the end and an additional element `u` at the beginning. Otherwise, `tree` remains unchanged but with an additional element `u` at the beginning.
