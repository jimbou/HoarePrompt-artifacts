Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way the tree is constructed and the moves are calculated.

In the given code, the tree is constructed as a deque, and the moves are calculated based on the index of the starting node in the deque. However, this approach does not correctly represent the tree structure and the possible moves.

For example, consider the input:

5 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5

The program will construct the tree as [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] and calculate the moves as [1, 4]. However, this is incorrect because the tree is not a simple array, and the moves should be calculated based on the actual tree structure.

A correct approach would be to construct the tree as an adjacency list or a matrix and then calculate the moves based on the actual tree structure. The program should also handle cases where the starting node is not a leaf node.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and the correctness is **False**.
