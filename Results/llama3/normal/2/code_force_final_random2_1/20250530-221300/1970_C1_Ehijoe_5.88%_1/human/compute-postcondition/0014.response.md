Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `tree` is an empty deque, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are integers where 1 <= u, v <= n, stdin contains n-2 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u, where 1 <= u <= n, and `v` is not equal to the last element of `tree`. Additionally, `u` is not equal to the first element of `tree`***
