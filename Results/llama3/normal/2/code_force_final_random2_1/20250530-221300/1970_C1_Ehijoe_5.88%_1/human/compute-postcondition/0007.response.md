Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque with at least two elements, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are integers where 1 <= u, v <= n, `v` is the second element of `tree`, stdin contains n-2 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u, where 1 <= u <= n.**

The code adds the value of `u` to the left of the deque `tree`. The value of `u` is equal to the first element of `tree` before the execution of the code. After the execution, `v` becomes the second element of `tree`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
