Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `empty` is False, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers where 1 <= u, v <= n, `tree` is a deque with an additional element `u` at the end, stdin contains n-5 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u, where 1 <= u <= n.**

In this output state, the value of `tree` has been updated by appending the value of `u` to the end of the deque. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains one less line of input, as the last line containing two integers `u` and `v` has been processed.
