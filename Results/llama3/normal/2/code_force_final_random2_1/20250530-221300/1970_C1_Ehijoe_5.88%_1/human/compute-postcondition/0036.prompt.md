You have been assigned the role of a program executor, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet consisting of multiple lines. Your task is to execute all the lines in sequence and provide the output state after the entire code block has been run. Avoid describing how the program runs step-by-step for individual lines but instead focus on the combined effect of all lines. When a variable has a specific value, use that specific value directly for calculations.  

Include all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution and update the values of any variables that are modified by the code. Provide the final state, icluding the state of all the variables after the execution of the code snippet. Use the text format: Output State: **output state**.

Here are some examples to help you understand the task:

Example 1:
Initial State: `a` is 5, `b` is 3
```
c = a + b
d = c * 2
```

Example Answer 1:
The first line assigns the value of `a + b` to `c`. Since `a` is 5 and `b` is 3, `c` becomes 8. The second line assigns the value of `c * 2` to `d`, making `d` equal to 16. No other variables are affected. 
Output State: **a is 5, b is 3, c is 8, d is 16**

Example 2:
Initial State: `x` is a positive integer , stdin contains 2 inputs: an integer and a second integer
```
n= int(input())
x += n
```

Example Answer 2:
The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. So now stdin only contains one integer now. The second line increments `x` by the value of `n`. The value of `x` is a positive integer, and `n` is an integer. No other variables are affected.
Output State: **x is a positive integer equal to its original value plus n , n is an integer, stdin contains 1 input: an integer **

Example 3:
Initial State: `n` is 3, `total` is 1 , stdin contains a space-separated list of integers
```
nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
total += n
pass
n= max(total, n)
```

Example Answer 3:
The first line assins to num a list of integers from stdin. Stdin is now empty so we dont include it in the output state.The second line increments `total` by the value of `n`, making `total` equal to 4. The thir line does not affect any variables. The 4th line assigns the maximum value between `total` and `n` to `n`. Since `total` is 4, and n was 3, `n` becomes 4.
Output State: **n is 4, total is 4**

Your Task:
Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `t` is 1, `empty` is False, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are integers where 1 <= u, v <= n, stdin contains n-6 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u, where 1 <= u <= n. If `empty` was True, then `tree` is a deque containing two integers u and v. If `empty` was False, then `tree` is updated based on the values of `u` and `v` as follows: if `v` is equal to the second element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with at least two elements. If `v` is equal to the second last element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with at least two elements. If `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with at least two elements, `u` is equal to the second element of `tree` and `v` is the first element of `tree`. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with an additional element `v` at the end. Otherwise, `tree` remains unchanged. If `empty` was True, then `tree` is a deque containing three integers u, u and v. If `empty` was False, then `tree` is updated based on the values of `u` and `v` as follows: if `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with an additional element `u` at the beginning. If `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with an additional element `u` at the end. If `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with `v` as the first element. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` is updated by appending `v` to it. If `v` is equal to the second element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with at least three elements. If `v` is equal to the second last element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with at least three elements. If `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with at least three elements, `u` is equal to the second element of `tree` and `v` is the first element of `tree`. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with an additional element `v` at the end and an additional element `u` at the beginning. Otherwise, `tree` remains unchanged but with an additional element `u` at the beginning or `tree` remains unchanged.
```
tree.append(u)
tree.append(v)
empty = False

```
Now, please analyze the entire block of code and provide the final output state. List the impact of all lines on the program, check the previous values of affected variables, and calculate the states of the variables after the codeexecutes. Be as specific as possible, combining changes from all lines into a single coherent final state. Include all valid information from the precondition and update only what is modified by the code.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans
