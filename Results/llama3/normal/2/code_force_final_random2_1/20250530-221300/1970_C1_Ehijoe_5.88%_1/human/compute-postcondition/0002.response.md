Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `tree` is an empty deque, `empty` is True, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are integers where 1 <= u, v <= n, stdin contains n-2 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u, where 1 <= u <= n**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `t`, `tree`, `empty`, and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `u` and `v` are assigned the values of the first two integers from the input, which are between 1 and `n` (inclusive). The stdin now contains `n-2` lines of two integers each, and finally one integer, as one line of input has been consumed.
