Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, t is 1, tree is an empty deque, empty is True, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, where 1 <= u, v <= n, and finally one integer u, where 1 <= u <= n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    u, v = map(int, input().split())
    if empty:
        tree.append(u)
        tree.append(v)
        empty = False
    elif v == tree[0]:
        tree.appendleft(u)
    elif v == tree[-1]:
        tree.append(u)
    elif u == tree[0]:
        tree.appendleft(v)
    elif u == tree[-1]:
        tree.append(v)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are integers where 1 <= u, v <= n, stdin contains n-2 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u, where 1 <= u <= n. If `empty` was True, then `tree` is a deque containing two integers u and v. If `empty` was False, then `tree` is updated based on the values of `u` and `v` as follows: if `v` is equal to the second element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with at least two elements. If `v` is equal to the second last element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with at least two elements. If `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with at least two elements, `u` is equal to the second element of `tree` and `v` is the first element of `tree`. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with an additional element `v` at the end. Otherwise, `tree` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `empty` is False, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers where 1 <= u, v <= n, stdin contains n-4 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u, where 1 <= u <= n. If `empty` was True, then `tree` is a deque containing two integers u and v. If `empty` was False, then `tree` is updated based on the values of `u` and `v` as follows: if `v` is equal to the second element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with at least two elements. If `v` is equal to the second last element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with at least two elements. If `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with at least two elements, `u` is equal to the second element of `tree` and `v` is the first element of `tree`. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with an additional element `v` at the end. Otherwise, `tree` remains unchanged. If `empty` was True, then `tree` is a deque containing three integers u, u and v. If `empty` was False, then `tree` is updated based on the values of `u` and `v` as follows: if `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with an additional element `u` at the beginning. If `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with an additional element `u` at the end. If `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with `v` as the first element. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` is updated by appending `v` to it. If `v` is equal to the second element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with at least three elements. If `v` is equal to the second last element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with at least three elements. If `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with at least three elements, `u` is equal to the second element of `tree` and `v` is the first element of `tree`. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with an additional element `v` at the end and an additional element `u` at the beginning. Otherwise, `tree` remains unchanged but with an additional element `u` at the beginning or `tree` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than 2, t is 1, empty is False, i is 2, u and v are integers where 1 <= u, v <= n, stdin contains n-6 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u, where 1 <= u <= n. If `empty` was True, then `tree` is a deque containing three integers u, u and v. If `empty` was False, then `tree` is updated based on the values of `u` and `v` as follows: if `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with an additional element `u` at the beginning. If `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with an additional element `u` at the end. If `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with `v` as the first element. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` is updated by appending `v` to it. If `v` is equal to the second element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with at least three elements. If `v` is equal to the second last element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with at least three elements. If `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with at least three elements, `u` is equal to the second element of `tree` and `v` is the first element of `tree`. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with an additional element `v` at the end and an additional element `u` at the beginning. If `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` is updated based on the values of `u` and `v` as follows: if `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with an additional element `u` at the end. If `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with `v` as the first element. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` is updated by appending `v` to it. If `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with an additional element `v` at the beginning. If `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with an additional element `v` at the end. If `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with at least three elements, `u` is equal to the second element of `tree` and `v` is the first element of `tree`. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with an additional element `v` at the end and an additional element `u` at the beginning. Otherwise, `tree` remains unchanged but with an additional element `u` at the beginning or `tree` remains unchanged but with an additional element `v` at the end. If `empty` was False, then `tree` is a deque with at least two elements.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
