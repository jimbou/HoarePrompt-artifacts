This function reads input from stdin, constructs a tree based on the input, and determines whether Ron or Hermione wins a game. The function accepts no parameters and returns no value, but instead prints 'Ron' or 'Hermione' to the console based on the parity of the minimum moves required to reach the start node from both ends of the tree. The function assumes that the input is well-formed and does not perform any error checking.
