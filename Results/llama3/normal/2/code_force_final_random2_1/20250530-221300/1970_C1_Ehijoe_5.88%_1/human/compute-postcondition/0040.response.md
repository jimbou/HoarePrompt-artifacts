Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `t` is 1, `empty` is False, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are integers where 1 <= u, v <= n, stdin contains n-7 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u, where 1 <= u <= n. If `empty` was True, then `tree` is a deque containing three integers u, u and v. If `empty` was False, then `tree` is updated based on the values of `u` and `v` as follows: if `v` is equal to the second element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with at least three elements. If `v` is equal to the second last element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with at least three elements. If `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with at least three elements, `u` is equal to the second element of `tree` and `v` is the first element of `tree`. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with an additional element `v` at the end and an additional element `v` at the end. Otherwise, `tree` remains unchanged but with an additional element `v` at the end.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, `t` is still 1, `empty` is still False, and `i` is still 2. The values of `u` and `v` are still integers between 1 and `n`. The stdin now contains one less line, which is a space-separated list of integers. The `tree` deque has been updated by appending the value of `v` to the end. If `empty` was True, then `tree` now contains three integers: `u`, `u`, and `v`. If `empty` was False, then `tree` has been updated based on the values of `u` and `v`, and it may have additional elements at the end.
