Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque with at least two elements, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are integers where 1 <= u, v <= n, `v` is equal to the second last element of `tree`, stdin contains n-2 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u, where 1 <= u <= n.**

In this output state, the value of `tree` has been updated by appending the value of `u` to it. The value of `v` is now equal to the second last element of `tree`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains n-2 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u.
