Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, t is 1, tree is a deque containing two integers u and v, empty is False, i is 0, u and v are integers where 1 <= u, v <= n, stdin contains n-3 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u, where 1 <= u <= n.**

The code executes as follows: The first line appends the value of `u` to the `tree` deque. Since `tree` was initially empty, it now contains one integer `u`. The second line appends the value of `v` to the `tree` deque. Now, `tree` contains two integers `u` and `v`. The third line sets the value of `empty` to `False`. No other variables are affected.
