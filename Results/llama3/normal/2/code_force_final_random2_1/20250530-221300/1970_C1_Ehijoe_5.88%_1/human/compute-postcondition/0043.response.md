Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `t` is 1, `empty` is False, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are integers where 1 <= u, v <= n, stdin contains n-7 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u, where 1 <= u <= n. If `empty` was True, then `tree` is a deque containing three integers u, u and v. If `empty` was False, then `tree` is updated based on the values of `u` and `v` as follows: if `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with an additional element `u` at the end. If `v` is not equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` is updated based on the values of `u` and `v` as follows: if `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with `v` as the first element. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` is updated by appending `v` to it. If `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with an additional element `v` at the beginning. If `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with an additional element `v` at the end. If `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with at least three elements, `u` is equal to the second element of `tree` and `v` is the first element of `tree`. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with an additional element `v` at the end and an additional element `u` at the beginning. Otherwise, `tree` remains unchanged but with an additional element `u` at the beginning or `tree` remains unchanged but with an additional element `v` at the end.***
