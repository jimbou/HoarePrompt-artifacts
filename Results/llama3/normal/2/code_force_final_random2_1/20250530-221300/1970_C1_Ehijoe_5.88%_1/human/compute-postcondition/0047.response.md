Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, t is 1, empty is False, i is n-1, u and v are integers where 1 <= u, v <= n, stdin is empty, start is an integer, idx is an integer, moves is a list containing two integers.**

The code block has the following effects on the program state:

1.  The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `start`. Since stdin is empty, this line does not consume any input.
2.  The second line assigns the index of `start` in `tree` to `idx`. This line does not modify any variables but creates a new variable `idx`.
3.  The third line assigns a list containing two integers to `moves`. The first integer is the minimum of `t` and `idx`, and the second integer is the minimum of `t` and `n - idx - 1`. This line does not modify any variables but creates a new variable `moves`.

The values of `n`, `t`, `empty`, `i`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The final state includes the new variables `start`, `idx`, and `moves` with their respective values.
