Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are integers where 1 <= u, v <= n, stdin contains n-2 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u, where 1 <= u <= n. If `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with at least two elements, `u` is equal to the second element of `tree` and `v` is the first element of `tree`. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` is a deque with an additional element `v` at the end. Otherwise, `tree` remains unchanged.***
