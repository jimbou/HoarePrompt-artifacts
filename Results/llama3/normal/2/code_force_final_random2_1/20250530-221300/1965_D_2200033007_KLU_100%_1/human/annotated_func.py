#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a list containing the first integer if the input list has an odd number of elements, otherwise it returns an empty list.

Otherwise, a[idx] and a[n - 1 - idx] are equal to (x - prev) // 2, and the rest are 0. In both cases, prev is the last odd number in the list, idx is -1, odds is an empty list, n is a positive odd integer >= 3, and x is the last odd number in the list.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a list of n numbers based on a given list of positive odd integers and a positive odd integer n. It takes a list of odd numbers and an odd integer n as input, where the length of the list is (n-1)/2, and returns a list of n numbers. The function constructs the output list by iterating through the input list of odd numbers, calculating values based on the difference between consecutive odd numbers, and assigning these values to specific positions in the output list. The resulting list has a symmetric structure, with values at mirrored positions being equal. The function returns the constructed list of n numbers.

    return bigList[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the list bigList.

#Overall this is what the function does:Removes common trailing elements from two lists and returns the last element of the longer list.
