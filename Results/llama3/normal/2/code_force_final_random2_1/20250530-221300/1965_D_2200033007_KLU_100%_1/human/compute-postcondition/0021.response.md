To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `i`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is less than `len(a)`. Since `i` is currently equal to `len(a)+1`, we need to adjust it to be less than `len(a)`.

We can adjust `i` to be `len(a)-1`, which is less than `len(a)`. This will ensure that the loop executes.

The state of `j` is currently equal to `len(a)`, which is not necessary for the loop to execute. We can leave it as is.

The other variables, `a`, `cts`, and `sm`, are not in the loop head, so we cannot adjust their states.

State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers with at least `len(a)+2` elements, `cts` is a list containing the sum of all elements of `a` and the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `a`, and the sum of the first `i+2` elements of `a`, and the sum of `a[i]`, `a[i+1]` and `a[i+2]`, and the sum of `a[i]`, `a[i+1]` and `a[i+2]` and `a[i+3]`, `i` is equal to `len(a)-1`, `sm` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to `len(a)`**
