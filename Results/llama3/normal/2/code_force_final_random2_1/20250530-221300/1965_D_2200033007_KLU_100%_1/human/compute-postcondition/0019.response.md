Output State: **The program returns a list of n numbers where if idx is equal to n - 1 - idx, then a[idx] is equal to x and a[n - 1 - idx] is equal to (x - prev) // 2, and the rest are 0. Otherwise, a[idx] and a[n - 1 - idx] are equal to (x - prev) // 2, and the rest are 0. In both cases, prev is the last odd number in the list, idx is -1, odds is an empty list, n is a positive odd integer >= 3, and x is the last odd number in the list.**
