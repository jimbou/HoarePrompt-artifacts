Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of n zeros, prev is 0, idx is (n-1)/2, odds is a list of positive integers of length (n-1)/2, n is a positive odd integer >= 3
Code of the loop:
for x in odds:
    if idx == n - 1 - idx:
        a[idx] = x
    else:
        a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
    prev = x
    idx = idx - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is a list of n numbers. If idx is equal to n - 1 - idx, the value at index n - 1 - idx in the list a is the first odd number in the list odds. Otherwise, a[idx] and a[n - 1 - idx] are equal to (x - prev) // 2, and the rest are 0. In both cases, prev is x, idx is (n-1)/2 - 1, odds is a list of positive integers of length (n-1)/2 that must have at least 1 odd number, n is a positive odd integer >= 3, and x is the first odd number in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: a is a list of n numbers. If idx is equal to n - 1 - idx, then a[idx] is equal to x and a[n - 1 - idx] is equal to (x - prev) // 2, and the rest are 0. Otherwise, a[idx] and a[n - 1 - idx] are equal to (x - prev) // 2, and the rest are 0. In both cases, prev is the first odd number in the list, idx is (n-1)/2 - 2, odds is a list of positive integers of length (n-1)/2 that must have at least 2 odd numbers, n is a positive odd integer >= 3, and x is the second odd number in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: a is a list of n numbers. If idx is equal to n - 1 - idx, then a[idx] is equal to x and a[n - 1 - idx] is equal to (x - prev) // 2, and the rest are 0. Otherwise, a[idx] and a[n - 1 - idx] are equal to (x - prev) // 2, and the rest are 0. In both cases, prev is the third odd number in the list, idx is (n-1)/2 - 3, odds is a list of positive integers of length (n-1)/2 that must have at least 3 odd numbers, n is a positive odd integer >= 3, and x is the third odd number in the list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
