Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers with at least len(a)+2 elements, cts is a list containing the sum of all elements of a and the sum of the first i+1 elements of a, and the sum of the first i+2 elements of a, and the sum of a[i], a[i+1] and a[i+2], and the sum of a[i], a[i+1] and a[i+2] and a[i+3], and the sum of a[j], a[j+1], and the sum of a[j], a[j+1], and a[j+2], i is equal to len(a)-1, sm is equal to a[j] + a[j+1] + a[j+2], j is equal to len(a)**

The code snippet modifies the `sm` variable by adding the value of `a[j]` to it, and then appends this new value of `sm` to the `cts` list. The value of `j` is equal to `len(a)`, which means it is out of range for the list `a`, so `a[j]` is not a valid element. However, since `sm` is initially equal to `a[j] + a[j+1]`, adding `a[j]` to it effectively doubles the value of `a[j]` in the sum. The `cts` list now contains an additional element, which is the sum of `a[j]`, `a[j+1]`, and `a[j+2]`. The values of `a`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
