Output State: **bigList is a list of integers with its last element removed, smallList is a list of integers with its last element removed, bigList is longer than smallList, and the last elements of the updated bigList and smallList are equal if bigList was more than one element longer than smallList, otherwise they are not equal.**

The code removes the last element from both `bigList` and `smallList`. Since `bigList` is longer than `smallList` and both lists have their last elements removed, the length difference between them remains the same. However, the equality of their last elements depends on the original length difference between the lists. If `bigList` was more than one element longer than `smallList`, removing one element from each would still leave `bigList` longer and their last elements would remain equal. But if `bigList` was exactly one element longer than `smallList`, removing one element from each would make them the same length, and their last elements would no longer be equal because the last element of `bigList` would now be different from the last element of `smallList`.
