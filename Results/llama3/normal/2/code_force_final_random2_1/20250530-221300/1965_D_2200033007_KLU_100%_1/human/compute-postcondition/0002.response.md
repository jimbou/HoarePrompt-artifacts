According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `bigList` and `smallList`. If `len(smallList) > 0` and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `bigList` is a list of integers, `smallList` is a list of integers, `bigList` is longer than `smallList`, the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal, and `smallList` must have at least one element, the last element of both lists has been removed. For the loop to be executed one more time, `smallList` must have at least two elements, and the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` must be equal.

State: **`bigList` is a list of integers, `smallList` is a list of integers, `bigList` is longer than `smallList`, `smallList` must have at least two elements, and the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` must be equal**
