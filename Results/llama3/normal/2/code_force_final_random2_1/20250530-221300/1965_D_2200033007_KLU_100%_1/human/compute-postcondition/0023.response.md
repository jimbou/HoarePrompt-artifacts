To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variables `j`, `i`, and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `len(a)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is equal to `len(a)`, which means the loop will not execute again. However, to make the loop execute again, we need to adjust the state of `j` and `a`.

Since `j` is equal to `len(a)`, we need to increase the length of `a` by at least 1 to make the loop execute again. Therefore, `a` must have at least `len(a)+1` elements.

The state of `i` is not relevant to the loop condition, so we don't need to adjust it.

The state of `cts` is not in the loop head, so we can't adjust it.

The state of `sm` is not in the loop head, so we can't adjust it.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers with at least len(a)+2 elements, `cts` is a list containing the sum of all elements of `a` and the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `a`, and the sum of the first `i+2` elements of `a`, and the sum of `a[i]`, `a[i+1]` and `a[i+2]`, and the sum of `a[i]`, `a[i+1]` and `a[i+2]` and `a[i+3]`, and the sum of `a[j]`, `i` is equal to `len(a)-1`, `sm` is equal to `a[j]`, `j` is equal to `len(a)+1`**
