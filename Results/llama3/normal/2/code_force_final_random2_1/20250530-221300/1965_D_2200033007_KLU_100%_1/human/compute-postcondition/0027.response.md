Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers with at least len(a)+2 elements, cts is a list containing the sum of all elements of a and the sum of the first i+1 elements of a, and the sum of the first i+2 elements of a, and the sum of a[i], a[i+1] and a[i+2], and the sum of a[i], a[i+1] and a[i+2] and a[i+3], and the sum of a[j], a[j+1], and the sum of a[j], a[j+1], and a[j+2], ..., and the sum of a[j], a[j+1], ..., and a[len(a)-1], i is equal to -1, sm is equal to the sum of all elements of a, j is equal to len(a)-1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `a` remains unchanged, the list `cts` contains the sum of all elements of `a` and the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `a`, and the sum of the first `i+2` elements of `a`, and the sum of `a[i]`, `a[i+1]` and `a[i+2]`, and the sum of `a[i]`, `a[i+1]` and `a[i+2]` and `a[i+3]`, and the sum of `a[j]`, `a[j+1]`, and the sum of `a[j]`, `a[j+1]`, and `a[j+2]`, ..., and the sum of `a[j]`, `a[j+1]`, ..., and `a[len(a)-1]`. The variable `i` is equal to `-1`, the variable `sm` is equal to the sum of all elements of `a`, and the variable `j` is equal to `len(a)-1`.
