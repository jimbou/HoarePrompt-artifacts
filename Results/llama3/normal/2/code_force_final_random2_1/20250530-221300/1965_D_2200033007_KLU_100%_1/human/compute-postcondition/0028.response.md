Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, cts is a list containing all possible sums of subarrays of a, i is equal to -1, sm is equal to the sum of all elements of a, j is equal to len(a)-1**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the list `a` remains unchanged, the list `cts` contains all possible sums of subarrays of `a`, the variable `i` is set to -1, the variable `sm` is set to the sum of all elements of `a`, and the variable `j` is set to the last index of the list `a`.
