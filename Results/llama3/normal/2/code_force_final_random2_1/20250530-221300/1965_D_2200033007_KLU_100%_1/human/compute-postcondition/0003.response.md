Output State: **bigList is a list of integers, smallList is a list of integers, bigList is longer than smallList, smallList has at least one element, and the last elements of bigList and smallList are equal.**

The code snippet consists of two lines, each removing the last element from `bigList` and `smallList`, respectively. Since the last elements of both lists were equal before the code execution, removing them does not change the fact that the last elements of the remaining lists are equal. The length of `bigList` is reduced by one, and the length of `smallList` is also reduced by one. However, since `bigList` was initially longer than `smallList`, it remains longer after the removal of the last elements. Additionally, since `smallList` had at least two elements initially, it now has at least one element after the removal of the last element.
