According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `i`. If `j` is less than `len(a)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `len(a)+1`, `i` is equal to `len(a)-1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be equal to `len(a)`. 
State: **a is a list of non-negative integers with at least len(a)+2 elements, cts is a list containing the sum of all elements of a and the sum of the first i+1 elements of a, and the sum of the first i+2 elements of a, and the sum of a[i], a[i+1] and a[i+2], and the sum of a[i], a[i+1] and a[i+2] and a[i+3], and the sum of a[j], a[j+1], i is equal to len(a)-1, sm is equal to a[j] + a[j+1], j is equal to len(a)**
