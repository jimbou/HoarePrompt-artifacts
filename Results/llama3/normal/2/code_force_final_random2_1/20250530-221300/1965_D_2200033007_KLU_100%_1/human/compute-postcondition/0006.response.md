Output State: **bigList is a list of integers, smallList is an empty list, and the last element of bigList is not equal to the last element of smallList.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing, bigList will still be a list of integers, but smallList will be empty because all its elements have been removed. Additionally, the last element of bigList will not be equal to the last element of smallList because the loop only continues as long as the last elements of both lists are equal, and once smallList is empty, this condition is no longer met.
