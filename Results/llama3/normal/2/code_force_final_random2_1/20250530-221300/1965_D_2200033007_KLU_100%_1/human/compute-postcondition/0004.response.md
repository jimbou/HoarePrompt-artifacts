To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `bigList` and `smallList`. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `len(smallList) > 0` and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `bigList` is longer than `smallList`, `smallList` has at least one element, and the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to make sure that `smallList` still has at least one element, and the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are still equal.

Since `smallList` has at least one element, we can ensure that it still has at least one element by not removing any elements from it. Therefore, we don't need to adjust the state of `smallList`.

However, we need to make sure that the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are still equal. Since the last elements are already equal, we can ensure that they remain equal by not modifying the last element of either list.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`bigList` is a list of integers, `smallList` is a list of integers, `bigList` is longer than `smallList`, `smallList` has at least one element, and the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal**
