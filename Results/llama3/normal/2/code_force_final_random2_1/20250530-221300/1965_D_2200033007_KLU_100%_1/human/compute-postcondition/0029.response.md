Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `cts` is a sorted list containing all possible sums of subarrays of `a`, `i` is equal to -1, `sm` is equal to the sum of all elements of `a`, `j` is equal to `len(a)-1`.**

In this output state, the list `cts` has been sorted in ascending order, while the other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains non-negative integers, `i` is still -1, `sm` is still the sum of all elements in `a`, and `j` is still equal to the last index of `a`.
