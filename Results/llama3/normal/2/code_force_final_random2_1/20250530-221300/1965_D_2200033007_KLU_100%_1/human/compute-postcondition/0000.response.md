To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head and adjust the states of `bigList` and `smallList` accordingly.

The loop head conditions are:

1. `len(smallList) > 0`
2. `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`

From the given state, we know:

* `bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers.
* `bigList` is longer than `smallList`.
* The last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal.

To satisfy the first condition, `len(smallList) > 0`, we need to ensure that `smallList` is not empty. Since we already know that `smallList` is a list of integers, we can conclude that `smallList` must have at least one element.

The second condition, `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`, is already satisfied by the given state, as we know the last elements of both lists are equal.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `smallList` has at least one element. We can achieve this by adding a constraint to the state of `smallList`.

State: **`bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers, `bigList` is longer than `smallList`, the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal, and `smallList` must have at least one element**
