Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: bigList and smallList are lists of integers, bigList is longer than smallList, and the last elements of bigList and smallList are equal.
Code of the loop:
while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
    bigList.pop()
    smallList.pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: bigList is a list of integers, smallList is a list of integers, bigList is longer than smallList, the last elements of bigList and smallList are equal, and smallList must have at least one element, the last element of both lists has been removed
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: bigList is a list of integers, smallList is a list of integers, bigList is longer than smallList, smallList has at least one element, and the last elements of bigList and smallList are equal.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: bigList is a list of integers with its last element removed, smallList is a list of integers with its last element removed, bigList is longer than smallList, and the last elements of the updated bigList and smallList are equal if bigList was more than one element longer than smallList, otherwise they are not equal.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
