Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers with at least len(a)+2 elements, cts is a list containing the sum of all elements of a and the sum of the first i+1 elements of a, and the sum of the first i+2 elements of a, and the sum of a[i], a[i+1] and a[i+2], and the sum of a[i], a[i+1] and a[i+2] and a[i+3], and the sum of a[j], a[j+1], i is equal to len(a)-1, sm is equal to a[j] + a[j+1], j is equal to len(a)+1**

In this output state, the list `a` remains unchanged, still containing non-negative integers with at least `len(a)+2` elements. The list `cts` has been appended with the new sum `sm`, which is the sum of `a[j]` and `a[j+1]`. The variable `sm` has been updated to include the sum of `a[j]` and `a[j+1]`. The variables `i` and `j` remain unchanged, with `i` still equal to `len(a)-1` and `j` still equal to `len(a)+1`.
