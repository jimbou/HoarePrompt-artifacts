Output State: **`a` is a list of n numbers, where `a[idx]` is equal to `x`, `a[n - 1 - idx]` is equal to `(x - prev) // 2`, and the rest are 0, `idx` is `(n-1)/2 - 1`, `n` is a positive odd integer >= 3, `x` is the second odd number in the list `odds`, `prev` is the first odd number in the list `odds`, and `odds` is a list of positive integers of length `(n-1)/2` that must have at least 2 odd numbers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `a` has been modified such that the element at index `idx` is now equal to `x`, which is the second odd number in the list `odds`. The element at index `n - 1 - idx` is equal to half of the difference between `x` and the first odd number `prev` in the list `odds`, and all other elements in the list are 0. The values of `idx`, `n`, `x`, `prev`, and `odds` remain unchanged.
