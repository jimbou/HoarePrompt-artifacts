Output State: **a is a list of n numbers where a[idx] and a[n - 1 - idx] are equal to (x - prev) // 2, and the rest are 0, odds is a list of positive integers of length (n-1)/2 that must have at least 3 odd numbers, n is a positive odd integer >= 3, and x is the third odd number in the list, idx is (n-1)/2 - 2, and prev is the first odd number in the list.**

In this output state, the values of a[idx] and a[n - 1 - idx] have been updated to (x - prev) // 2, while the rest of the elements in the list remain 0. The other variables, including odds, n, x, idx, and prev, retain their original values and properties as specified in the initial state.
