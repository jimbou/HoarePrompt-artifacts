Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `T` is equal to `t`, `ans` is equal to `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `b` is equal to `min(n, m) + 1`, stdin contains no test cases, and the value of `ans` is being printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has executed all the iterations specified by the value of `t`. The variable `T` has reached the value of `t`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `ans` has been calculated and printed for each test case, and the input stream `stdin` has been exhausted, containing no more test cases. The values of `n` and `m` are still positive integers, and `b` has reached the value of `min(n, m) + 1`, indicating that the inner loop has also completed all its iterations.
