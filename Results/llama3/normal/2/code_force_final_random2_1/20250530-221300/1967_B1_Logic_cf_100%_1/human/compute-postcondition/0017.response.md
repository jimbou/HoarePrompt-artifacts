Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `T` is 1, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer that is at least 3, `b` is 3, `min(n, m)` is at least 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding the result of `(n + b) // (b * b)`, where `b` is 3. The other variables remain unchanged, and the precondition that `min(n, m)` is at least 3 is still valid.
