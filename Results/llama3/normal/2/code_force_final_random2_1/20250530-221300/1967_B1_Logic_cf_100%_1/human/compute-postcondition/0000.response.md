Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two positive integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6).**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first test case from the input, which is a positive integer. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one test case, as one test case has been read and assigned to `t`. The remaining test cases still contain two positive integers `n` and `m`, each within the range of 1 to 2 * 10^6.
