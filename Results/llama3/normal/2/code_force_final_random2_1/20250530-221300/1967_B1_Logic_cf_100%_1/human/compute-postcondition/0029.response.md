To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):`. The objects involved in the loop head are `b`, `n`, and `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is equal to `min(n, m) + 2`, which is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `b` must be incremented by 1, so `b` becomes `min(n, m) + 3`.

The values of `n` and `m` do not change, as they are not modified in the loop body.

The state of `stdin` is not affected by the loop, as it is not involved in the loop head.

The state of `t`, `T`, and `ans` is not affected by the loop, as they are not involved in the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `T` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + min(n, m) + 1) // (min(n, m) + 1)^2 + (n + min(n, m) + 2) // ((min(n, m) + 2) * (min(n, m) + 2))`, `n` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `m` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `b` is equal to `min(n, m) + 3` which is at least 5, stdin contains multiple test cases minus five test cases.**
