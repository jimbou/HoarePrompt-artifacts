Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `T` is 0, `ans` is a positive integer that is equal to its previous value plus the integer division of `n + b` by `b * b`, `n` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `m` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `b` is an integer between 2 and `min(n, m) + 1` (inclusive), `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated by adding the result of the integer division of `n + b` by `b * b` to its previous value. The values of `t`, `T`, `n`, `m`, and `b` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in `stdin` is still reduced by two.
