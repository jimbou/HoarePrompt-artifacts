The only variable in the loop head is variable b, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable b. If b is less than min(n, m) + 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, b is equal to min(n, m) + 1 which is at least 3. So for the loop to be executed one more time b must be increased by 1 and must be less than min(n, m) + 1. Also, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, so stdin contains multiple test cases minus five test cases.
State: **`t` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `T` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + min(n, m) + 1) // (min(n, m) + 1)^2`, `n` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `m` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `b` is equal to `min(n, m) + 2` which is at least 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus five test cases**
