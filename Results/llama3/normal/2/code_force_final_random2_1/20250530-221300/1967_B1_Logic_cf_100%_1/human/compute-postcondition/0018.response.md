To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `b`, which is being iterated over a range from 2 to `min(n, m) + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is 3. For the loop to execute again, `b` needs to be incremented by 1, so `b` becomes 4.

The loop will execute again as long as `b` is less than or equal to `min(n, m)`. Since `min(n, m)` is at least 3, and `b` is now 4, `min(n, m)` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables in the state (`t`, `T`, `ans`, `n`, and `m`) are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`t` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `T` is 1, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer that is at least 3, `b` is 4, `min(n, m)` is at least 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**
