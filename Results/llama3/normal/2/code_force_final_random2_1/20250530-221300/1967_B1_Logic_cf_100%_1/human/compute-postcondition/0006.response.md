Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `T` is 0, `ans` is a positive integer that is equal to its previous value plus the integer division of `n + b` by `b * b`, `n` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `m` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `b` is an integer between 3 and `min(n, m) + 1` (inclusive), `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases**

The value of `ans` is updated by adding the integer division of `n + b` by `b * b` to its previous value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.
