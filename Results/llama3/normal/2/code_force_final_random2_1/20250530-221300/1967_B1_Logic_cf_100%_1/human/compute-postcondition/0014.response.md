To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `b`, `n`, and `m`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `min(n, m)` is at least 2, since the range starts from 2.

State: **`t` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `T` is 1, `ans` is equal to `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `b` is 2, `min(n, m)` is at least 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases**
