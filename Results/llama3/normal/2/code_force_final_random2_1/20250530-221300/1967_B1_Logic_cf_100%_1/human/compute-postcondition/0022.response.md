The code prints the value of `ans` which is equal to `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`. This value is calculated based on the values of `n` and `m`, which are positive integers, and `b`, which is equal to `min(n, m) + 1`. The exact numerical value of `ans` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `n` and `m`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: ** `t` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `T` is 1, `ans` is equal to `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `b` is equal to `min(n, m) + 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, and ans is printed, ans (where ans is the calculated value of `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`)**
