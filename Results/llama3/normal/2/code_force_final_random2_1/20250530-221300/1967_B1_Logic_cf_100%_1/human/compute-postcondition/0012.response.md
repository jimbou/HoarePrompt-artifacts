The only variable in the loop head is variable T, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable T and t. If T is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, T is 0, t is a positive integer that is at least 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time T is 1 and t must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `T` is 1, `ans` is a positive integer that is equal to its initial value plus the sum of the integer divisions of `n + b` by `b * b` for all `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`, `n` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `m` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `b` is equal to `min(n, m) + 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, and the value of `ans` is being printed**
