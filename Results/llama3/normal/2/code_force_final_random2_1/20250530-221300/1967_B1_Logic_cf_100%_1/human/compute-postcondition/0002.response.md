The code snippet reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the input, converts them to integers, and assigns the value of `n` to `ans`. 

Since `t` is a positive integer that is at least 1 and `T` is 0, these variables remain unchanged. The input contains multiple test cases minus one test case, and the code reads one test case, so the input now contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.

Output State: **t is a positive integer that is at least 1, T is 0, ans is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**
