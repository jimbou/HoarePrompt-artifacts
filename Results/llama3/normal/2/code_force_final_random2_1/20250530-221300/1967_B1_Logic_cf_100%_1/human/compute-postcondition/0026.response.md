Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `T` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + min(n, m) + 1) // (min(n, m) + 1)^2`, `n` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `m` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `b` is equal to `min(n, m) + 1` which is at least 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding the result of the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)`, where `b` is equal to `min(n, m) + 1`. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus four test cases.
