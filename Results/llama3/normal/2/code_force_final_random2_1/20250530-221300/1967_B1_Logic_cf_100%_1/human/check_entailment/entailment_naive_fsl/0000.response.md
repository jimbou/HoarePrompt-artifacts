Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The issue lies in the line where the program calculates the additional pairs for each b:

`ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`

This line assumes that for each b, the number of additional pairs is `(n + b) // (b * b)`. However, this is not correct. The correct calculation should be `(n // (b * b))`, because we are counting the number of multiples of `b * b` that are less than or equal to `n`.

For example, when `n = 10` and `b = 2`, the program calculates `(10 + 2) // (2 * 2) = 6`, but the correct calculation is `10 // (2 * 2) = 2.5`, which should be rounded down to 2.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and the correctness is **False**.
