Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `T` is 0, `ans` is a positive integer that is equal to its initial value plus the sum of the integer divisions of `n + b` by `b * b` for all `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`, `n` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `m` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `b` is equal to `min(n, m) + 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the value of `ans` has been updated to include the sum of the integer divisions of `n + b` by `b * b` for all `b` from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m`. The value of `b` is now equal to `min(n, m) + 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The other variables remain unchanged.
