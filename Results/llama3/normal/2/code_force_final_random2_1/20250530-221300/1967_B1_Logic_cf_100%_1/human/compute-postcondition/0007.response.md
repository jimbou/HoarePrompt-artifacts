The only variable in the loop head is variable  b, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is less than `min(n, m)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is between 3 and `min(n, m) + 1` (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `b` must be increased by 1 and must be less than or equal to `min(n, m)`.
State: **`t` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `T` is 0, `ans` is a positive integer that is equal to its previous value plus the integer division of `n + b` by `b * b`, `n` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `m` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `b` is an integer between 4 and `min(n, m)` (inclusive), `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases**
