To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `T` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `t` is a positive integer, we can adjust the state to `t` is at least 1 and `T` is 0 (the initial value of the loop counter).

State: **`t` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `T` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two positive integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6)**
