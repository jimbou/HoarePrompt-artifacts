To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `b`, `n`, and `m`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `b` is less than `min(n, m) + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is 2, `min(n, m)` is at least 2, and `n` and `m` are positive integers.

For the loop to execute again, `b` must be incremented by 1, so `b` becomes 3. Additionally, `min(n, m)` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `T` is 1, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4`, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer that is at least 3, `b` is 3, `min(n, m)` is at least 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases**
