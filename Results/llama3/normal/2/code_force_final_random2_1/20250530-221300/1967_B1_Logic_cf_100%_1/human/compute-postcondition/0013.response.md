Output State: **t is a positive integer that is at least 2, T is 1, ans is equal to n, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer that is at least 2, b is equal to min(n, m) + 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

The code block reads two space-separated integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `m`. It then assigns the value of `n` to `ans`. The values of `t`, `T`, and `b` are not affected by the code. The value of `ans` is updated to be equal to `n`. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one.
