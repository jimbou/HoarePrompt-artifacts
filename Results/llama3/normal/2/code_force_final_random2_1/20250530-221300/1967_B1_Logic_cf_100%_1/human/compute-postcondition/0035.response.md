Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains two positive integers n and m. It calculates a value 'ans' for each test case, which is the sum of n and the number of integers from 2 to the minimum of n and m that divide n with a remainder of b-1, where b is the divisor. The function then prints the calculated 'ans' value for each test case.**
