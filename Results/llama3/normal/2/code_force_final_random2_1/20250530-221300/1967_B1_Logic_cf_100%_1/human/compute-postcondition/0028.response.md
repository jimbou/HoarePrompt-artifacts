Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `T` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + min(n, m) + 1) // (min(n, m) + 1)^2 + (n + min(n, m) + 2) // ((min(n, m) + 2) * (min(n, m) + 2))`, `n` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `m` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `b` is equal to `min(n, m) + 2` which is at least 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus five test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding the result of the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its previous value. The values of `t`, `T`, `n`, `m`, and `b` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin has also not changed.
