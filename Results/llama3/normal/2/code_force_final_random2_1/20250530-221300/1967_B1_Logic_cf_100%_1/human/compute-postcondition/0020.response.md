Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `T` is 1, `ans` is equal to `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `b` is equal to `min(n, m) + 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer that is at least 2, `T` remains 1, `ans` is updated to include the sum of the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` for all values of `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`, `n` remains a positive integer, `m` remains a positive integer that is at least 2, `b` is updated to be one more than the minimum of `n` and `m`, and the number of test cases in stdin remains unchanged.
