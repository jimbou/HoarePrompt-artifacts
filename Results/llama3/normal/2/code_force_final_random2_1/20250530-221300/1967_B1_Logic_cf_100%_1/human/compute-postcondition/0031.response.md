Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `T` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n + sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(min(n, m) + 1, min(n, m) + 1))`, `n` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `m` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `b` is equal to `min(n, m) + 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `t` and `T` remain unchanged, `n` and `m` are still positive integers at least 2, `b` is equal to `min(n, m) + 1`, and `ans` is equal to `n` plus the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for `i` ranging from `min(n, m) + 1` to `min(n, m) + 1`. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by four.
