To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `b`, `n`, and `m`. The loop will execute if `min(n, m)` is at least 2, since the range starts from 2. 

Since `b` is equal to `min(n, m) + 1`, for the loop to execute, `b` must be at least 3. However, we cannot adjust `b` directly, as it is being reassigned in the loop. Instead, we need to adjust `n` and `m` to ensure that `min(n, m)` is at least 2.

State: **`t` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `T` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n`, `n` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `m` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `b` is equal to `min(n, m) + 1` which is at least 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases**
