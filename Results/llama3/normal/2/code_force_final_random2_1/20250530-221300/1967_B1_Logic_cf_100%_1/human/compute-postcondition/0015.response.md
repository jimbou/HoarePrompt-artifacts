Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `T` is 1, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4`, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `b` is 2, `min(n, m)` is at least 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to `n + (n + 2) // 4`, which is the result of adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to the original value of `ans`, where `b` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.
