Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all possible cases. One case where the program fails is when Alice's chip is in the last row and Bob's chip is in the first row, but they are not in the same column. In this case, the program should output "Draw" because neither player can make a move, but the program does not handle this case correctly.

For example, if the input is "10 10 10 5 1 3", the program should output "Draw" because Alice's chip is in the last row and Bob's chip is in the first row, but they are not in the same column. However, the program does not handle this case correctly and outputs "Alice" instead.

This is because the program only checks if Alice's chip is in the last row or Bob's chip is in the first row, but it does not check if they are in the same column. Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all possible cases and is incorrect.
