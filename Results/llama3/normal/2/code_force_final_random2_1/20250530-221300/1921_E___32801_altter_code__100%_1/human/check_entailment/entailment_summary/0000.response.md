Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly determines the winner of the game based on the positions of the two chips on the board. The program takes into account the parity of the chip coordinates, the relative positions of the chips, and the boundaries of the board. It also handles the cases where one chip is in the last row or the first row, and the other chip is not. The program prints 'draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' depending on the outcome of the game.

Correctness: **True**
