Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, l is n, r is n - 2, sunks is 1 or 2. The value at index r in list a is 0.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The value of `k` is also unchanged as a positive integer. The list `a` remains a list of `n` positive integers. The value of `l` is now `n`, and the value of `r` is now `n - 2`. The value of `sunks` is either 1 or 2. The value at index `r` in list `a` is now 0.
