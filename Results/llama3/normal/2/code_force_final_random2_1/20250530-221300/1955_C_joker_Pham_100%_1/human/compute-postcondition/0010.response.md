Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is 0 or 1. If `k` is greater than or equal to the value at index `r` in list `a`, then `sunks` is set to 1. Otherwise, no changes are made. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
