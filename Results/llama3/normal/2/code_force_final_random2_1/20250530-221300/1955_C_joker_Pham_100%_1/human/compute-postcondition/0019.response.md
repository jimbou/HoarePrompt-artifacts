Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is 0 or 1. The current value of `sunks` is determined by the relationship between `k` and the value at index `r` in list `a`: if `k` is greater than or equal to the value at index `r`, then `sunks` is 1, otherwise `sunks` is 0. The value at index `l` in list `a` is less than or equal to the value at index `r` in list `a`. Additionally, `k` is less than the value at index `l` in list `a` multiplied by 2. Furthermore, the current value of `k` is exactly one less than twice the value at index `l` in list `a`.***
