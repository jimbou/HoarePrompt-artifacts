Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, then `k` is decreased by 2 times the value of `a[l]`, the value at index `r` in `a` is decreased by the value at index `l`, `l` is increased by 1, and `sunks` is increased by 1. If `a[r]` becomes 0 and `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]` after the decrease, then `sunks` is increased by 2 and `r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if `a[l] * 2 - 1` is equal to `k`, then `sunks` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, then `sunks` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no change occurs. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
