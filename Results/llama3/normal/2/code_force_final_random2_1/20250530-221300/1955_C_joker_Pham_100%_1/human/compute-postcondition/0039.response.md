Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers. If `k` is 0, then the current value of `l` is `n - 1`, the current value of `r` is `n - 1`, the value at index `l` in list `a` is less than or equal to the value at index `r` in list `a`, `sunks` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is not 0, then if `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, then the current value of `l` remains `n - 1`, the current value of `r` remains `n - 1`, and the value at index `l` in list `a` is less than or equal to the value at index `r` in list `a`. Additionally, if `k` is exactly one less than twice the value at index `l` in list `a`, then `sunks` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, if `k` is greater than or equal to the value at index `r` in list `a`, then `sunks` is 1, otherwise `sunks` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[l]` is greater than `a[r]`, then no changes are made. The value at index `r` in list `a` is less than the value at index `l` in list `a`. Additionally, `k` is less than twice the value at index `r` in list `a`. The value at index `r` in list `a` multiplied by 2 is not equal to `k`.***
