Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is 0 or 1. The value at index `l` in list `a` is less than or equal to the value at index `r` in list `a`. If `k` is greater than or equal to the value at index `r` in list `a`, then the current value of `sunks` is 1. Otherwise, the current value of `sunks` is 0. Additionally, `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value at index `l` in list `a`.**
