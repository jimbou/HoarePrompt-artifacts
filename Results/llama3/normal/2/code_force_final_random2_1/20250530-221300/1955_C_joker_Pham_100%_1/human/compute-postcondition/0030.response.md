Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers. If `k` is 0, then the current value of `l` is `n - 1`, the current value of `r` is `n - 1`, the value at index `l` in list `a` is less than or equal to the value at index `r` in list `a`, `sunks` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is not 0, then if `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, then the current value of `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value at index `r` in list `a`. The current value of `l` is `n`, the current value of `r` is `n - 2`, and the value at index `r` in list `a` is set to 0, and `sunks` is 1 or 2. Additionally, the value at index `r` in list `a` is less than the value at index `l` in list `a`.***
