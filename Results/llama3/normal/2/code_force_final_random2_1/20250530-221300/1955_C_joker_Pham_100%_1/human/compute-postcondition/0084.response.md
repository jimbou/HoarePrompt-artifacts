Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than `r`. If `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to the value at index `r` in list `a`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
