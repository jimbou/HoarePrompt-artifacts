Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers. If `k` is 0, then the current value of `l` is `n - 1`, the current value of `r` is `n - 1`, the value at index `l` in list `a` is less than or equal to the value at index `r` in list `a`, `sunks` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is not 0, then if `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value at index `l` in list `a`, then the current value of `l` is `n`, the current value of `r` is `n - 3`, the value at index `r` in list `a` is set to 0, `sunks` is 2 or 3, and the value at index `l` in list `a` is less than the value at index `r` in list `a`. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is updated to `n + 1`, `sunks` is updated to 3 or 4, and the value at index `l` in list `a` is still less than the value at index `r` in list `a`. Otherwise, the current value of `l` remains `n - 1`, the current value of `r` remains `n - 1`, and the value at index `l` in list `a` is less than or equal to the value at index `r` in list `a`. Additionally, if `k` is exactly one less than twice the value at index `l` in list `a`, then `sunks` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, if `k` is greater than or equal to the value at index `r` in list `a`, then `sunks` is 1, otherwise `sunks` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[l]` is greater than `a[r]`, then no changes are made. The value at index `r` in list `a` is less than the value at index `l` in list `a`. Additionally, `k` is less than twice the value at index `r` in list `a`. If `a[r] * 2` equals `k`, then `sunks` is 1 or 2 or 3.***
