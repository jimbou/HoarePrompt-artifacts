Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers. If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value at index `l` in list `a`, then `l` is set to `n`, `r` is set to `n - 2`, and the value at index `r` in list `a` is set to 0, and `sunks` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, `l` remains `n - 1`, `r` remains `n - 1`, and the value at index `l` in list `a` is less than or equal to the value at index `r` in list `a`. Additionally, if `k` is exactly one less than twice the value at index `l` in list `a`, then `sunks` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, if `k` is greater than or equal to the value at index `r` in list `a`, then `sunks` is 1, otherwise `sunks` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[l]` is greater than `a[r]`, then no changes are made.***
