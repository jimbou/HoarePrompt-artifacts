Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer decreased by 2 times the value of a[r], a is a list of n positive integers where the value at index l is decreased by the value at index r, l is less than or equal to r, sunks is increased by 1. If a[l] is 0, then l is less than r and sunks is increased by 2. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains the same.***
