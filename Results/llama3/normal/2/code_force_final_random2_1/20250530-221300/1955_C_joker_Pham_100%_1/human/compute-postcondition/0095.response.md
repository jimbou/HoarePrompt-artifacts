Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than `r`. If `a[r] * 2` equals `k`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value at index `l` in list `a`, then `k` is reduced by twice the value at index `l`, the value at index `r` is reduced by the value at index `l`, `l` is incremented by 1, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `k` is less than twice the value at index `l` but `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to the value at index `r` in list `a`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[l]` is greater than `a[r]`, no specific action is taken. If `k` equals 0, no specific action is taken.**
