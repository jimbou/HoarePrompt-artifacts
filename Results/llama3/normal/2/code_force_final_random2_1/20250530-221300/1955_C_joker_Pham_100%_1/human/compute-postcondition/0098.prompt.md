Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, sunks is 0
Code of the loop:
while l <= r:
    if k == 0:
        break
    if l == r:
        if k >= a[r]:
            sunks += 1
            break
        break
    if a[l] <= a[r]:
        if k >= a[l] * 2:
            k -= a[l] * 2
            a[r] -= a[l]
            if a[r] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
            sunks += 1
            l += 1
            continue
        elif a[l] * 2 - 1 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break
    if k == 0:
        break
    if a[r] < a[l]:
        if k >= a[r] * 2:
            k -= a[r] * 2
            a[l] -= a[r]
            if a[l] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
            sunks += 1
            r -= 1
            continue
        elif a[r] * 2 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers. If `k` is 0, then the current value of `l` is `n - 1`, the current value of `r` is `n - 1`, the value at index `l` in list `a` is less than or equal to the value at index `r` in list `a`, `sunks` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is not 0, then if `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value at index `l` in list `a`, then the current value of `l` is `n`, the current value of `r` is `n - 3`, the value at index `r` in list `a` is set to 0, `sunks` is 2 or 3, and the value at index `l` in list `a` is less than the value at index `r` in list `a`. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is updated to `n + 1`, `sunks` is updated to 3 or 4, and the value at index `l` in list `a` is still less than the value at index `r` in list `a`. Otherwise, the current value of `l` remains `n - 1`, the current value of `r` remains `n - 1`, and the value at index `l` in list `a` is less than or equal to the value at index `r` in list `a`. Additionally, if `k` is exactly one less than twice the value at index `l` in list `a`, then `sunks` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, if `k` is greater than or equal to the value at index `r` in list `a`, then `sunks` is 1, otherwise `sunks` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[l]` is greater than `a[r]`, then no changes are made. The value at index `r` in list `a` is less than the value at index `l` in list `a`. Additionally, `k` is less than twice the value at index `r` in list `a`. If `a[r] * 2` equals `k`, then `sunks` is 1 or 2 or 3.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, then `k` is decreased by 2 times the value of `a[r]`, the value at index `l` in `a` is decreased by the value at index `r`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and `sunks` is increased by 2. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is less than `r` and `sunks` is increased by 3. Otherwise, if `a[r] * 2` is equal to `k`, then `sunks` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, then `k` is decreased by 2 times the value of `a[l]`, the value at index `r` in `a` is decreased by the value at index `l`, `l` is increased by 1, and `sunks` is increased by 1. If `a[r]` becomes 0 and `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]` after the decrease, then `sunks` is increased by 2 and `r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if `a[l] * 2 - 1` is equal to `k`, then `sunks` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, then `sunks` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no change occurs. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than `r`. If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value at index `r` in list `a`, then `k` is reduced by twice the value at index `r`, the value at index `l` is reduced by the value at index `r` and `l` is less than `r`, `sunks` is increased by 1, and `r` is reduced by 1. If `k` is less than twice the value at index `r` but `a[r] * 2` equals `k`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value at index `l` in list `a`, then `k` is reduced by twice the value at index `l`, the value at index `r` is reduced by the value at index `l`, `l` is incremented by 1, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `k` is less than twice the value at index `l` but `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to the value at index `r` in list `a`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[l]` is greater than `a[r]`, no specific action is taken. If `k` equals 0, no specific action is taken.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
