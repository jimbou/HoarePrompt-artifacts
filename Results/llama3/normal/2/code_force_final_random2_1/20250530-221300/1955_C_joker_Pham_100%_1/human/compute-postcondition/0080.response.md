Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer minus twice the value at index l in list a, a is a list of n positive integers where the value at index r is reduced by the value at index l, l is less than r. If the value at index r in list a is 0, then r is reduced by 1 and sunks is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.***
