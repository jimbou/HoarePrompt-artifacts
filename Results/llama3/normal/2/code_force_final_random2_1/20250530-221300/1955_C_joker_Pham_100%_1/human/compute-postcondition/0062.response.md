Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer decreased by 2 times the value of a[r], a is a list of n positive integers where the value at index l is decreased by the value at index r, l is less than or equal to r, sunks is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `k` is decreased by 2 times the value of `a[r]`, and the value at index `l` in `a` is decreased by the value at index `r`. The value of `sunks` is increased by 1. The values of `n`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
