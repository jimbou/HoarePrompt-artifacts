Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than `r`. If `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to the value at index `r` in list `a`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l` does not equal `r`, no specific action is taken.***
