Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer minus 2 times the value of a[l], a is a list of n positive integers where the value at index r is decreased by the value at index l, l is less than or equal to r. If a[r] is 0, then sunks is increased by 2 if l is equal to r and k is greater than or equal to a[r] after the decrease, and r is decreased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
