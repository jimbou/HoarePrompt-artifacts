Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer reduced by twice the value at index r in list a, a is a list of n positive integers. If the value at index l is 0, then l is equal to r and sunks is increased by 1. Otherwise, the value at index l is reduced by the value at index r and l is less than r, sunks is not affected.***
