Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, l is n, r is n - 2, the value at index r in list a is 0, sunks is 1 or 2, and the value at index l in list a is less than the value at index r in list a. If a[l] is 0, then l is updated to n + 1, sunks is updated to 2 or 3, and the value at index l in list a is still less than the value at index r in list a. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
