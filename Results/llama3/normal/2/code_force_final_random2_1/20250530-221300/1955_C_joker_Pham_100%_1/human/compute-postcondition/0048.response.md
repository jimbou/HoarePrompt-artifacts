Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
