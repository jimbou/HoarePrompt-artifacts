Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, l is n - 1, r is n - 1, sunks is 0 or 1. The value at index l in list a is less than or equal to the value at index r in list a. The value at index r in list a is decreased by the value at index l in list a. k is decreased by twice the value at index l in list a. If the new value of k is greater than or equal to the new value at index r in list a, then the current value of sunks is 1. Otherwise, the current value of sunks is 0. If the value at index r in list a is 0, then k is decreased by twice the value at index l in list a, the value at index r in list a is 0, l is n - 1, r is n - 2, and sunks is 1 or 2.***
