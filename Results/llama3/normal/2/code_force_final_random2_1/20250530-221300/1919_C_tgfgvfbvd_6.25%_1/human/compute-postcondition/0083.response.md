Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than `y + 1`, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is `n - 1`, `_` is 1, `x` is at least `y + 1` (which is `n`), `a` is the first element of `l`, `b` is `l[x]`, `c` is 0. The current value of `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `b`. Additionally, `l[x] - a` is less than `l[x] - b` is no longer valid since `b` is now `l[x]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `n` is still an integer greater than `y + 1`, `l` is still a list of integers, `y` is still `n - 1`, `_` is still 1, `x` is still at least `y + 1` (which is `n`), `a` is still the first element of `l`, but `b` is now equal to `l[x]`, and `c` is still 0. The condition that `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `b` is no longer valid because `b` is now equal to `l[x]`.
