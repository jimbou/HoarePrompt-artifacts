Output State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is an integer less than `n`, `_` is 2, `x` is `y + 1`, `a` is the first element of `l`, `b` is the value of `l[x]`, `c` is 0, `stdin` is empty. The current value of `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and the previous value of `b`. The difference between `l[x]` and `a` is less than the difference between `l[x]` and the previous value of `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `b` has been updated to be the value of `l[x]`, which is greater than both `a` and the previous value of `b`. The difference between `l[x]` and `a` is less than the difference between `l[x]` and the previous value of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
