Output State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is an integer equal to the first element of `l`, `b` is equal to `l[x]`, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `_` is 0, `x` is `y + 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The current value of `l[x]` is less than `a` and less than `b`. Either `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`. The difference between `a` and `l[x]` is greater than the difference between `b` and `l[x]`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to `l[x]`, which is the current element in the list `l` at index `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the relationships between `a`, `b`, and `l[x]` are still valid, as `l[x]` is now equal to `b`.
