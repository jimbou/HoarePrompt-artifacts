To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `y` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `y` needs to be incremented by 1, so `y` becomes 3. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `y` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is 3, `_` is 2, `x` is equal to `n`, `a` is the first element of `l`, `c` is 0, `stdin` is empty. If the third element of `l` is greater than the second element of `l`, then `b` is the third element of `l`. Otherwise, `b` is 0 or the second element of `l` (if it is greater than the first element of `l`).**
