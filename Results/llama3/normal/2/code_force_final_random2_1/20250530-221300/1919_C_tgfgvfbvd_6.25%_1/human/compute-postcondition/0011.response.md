Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 2, l is a list of integers, a is an integer equal to the first element of l, y is 3, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If the third element of l is greater than the second element, then b is equal to the third element of l and c is 0. Otherwise, b and c remain 0.***
