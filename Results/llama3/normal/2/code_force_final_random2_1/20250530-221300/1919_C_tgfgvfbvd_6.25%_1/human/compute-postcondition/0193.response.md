The code prints the value of `c`, which is an integer between 0 and `n - y - 1`. Since the exact values of `n` and `y` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `c`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output an integer within the specified range.

Output: **an integer between 0 and n - y - 1**
