Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, l is a list of integers, y is n - 1, _ is 1, x is n, a is the first element of l, b is the maximum of the first element of l and the maximum of the elements of l from index 1 to n - 1, c is 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
        if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
        c += 1
    elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
        if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    elif a >= l[x]:
        a = l[x]
    else:
        b = l[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than `y + 1`, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is `n - 1`, `_` is 1, `x` is at least `y + 1` (which is `n`), `c` is either 0 or 1. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 1, `a` is either the first element of `l` or `l[x]`, whichever is smaller, and `b` is the maximum of the first element of `l` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1`, or `l[x]` if the difference between `l[x]` and the first element of `l` is less than the difference between `l[x]` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 0, `a` is the current value of `l[x]`, and `b` is the maximum of the first element of `l` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1`. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` but not less than `b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b` but not less than `a`, then `b` is set to `l[x]` and `a` is less than `l[x]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than `y + 1`, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is `n - 1`, `_` is 1, `x` is at least `y + 2` (which is `n`). `c` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 2, `a` is either the first element of `l` or `l[x]`, whichever is smaller, and `b` is the maximum of the first element of `l` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1`, or `l[x]` if the difference between `l[x]` and the first element of `l` is less than the difference between `l[x]` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 0, `a` is the current value of `l[x]`, and `b` is the maximum of the first element of `l` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1`. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` but not less than `b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b` but not less than `a`, then `b` is set to `l[x]` and `a` is less than `l[x]`. If `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, then `a` is `l[x]`, and `b` is the maximum of the first element of `l` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1`, or `l[x]` if the difference between `l[x]` and the first element of `l` is less than the difference between `l[x]` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1`. Otherwise, `a` is either the first element of `l` or `l[x]`, whichever is smaller, and `b` is `l[x]`. If `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, then `a` is `l[x]`, otherwise `a` is either the first element of `l` or `l[x]`, whichever is smaller, and `b` is `l[x]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than `x`, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is `n - 1`, `_` is 1, `x` is at least `y + 3` (which is `n + 1`), `c` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3. `a` is either the first element of `l` or `l[x]`, whichever is smaller, and `b` is the maximum of the first element of `l` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1`, or `l[x]` if the difference between `l[x]` and the first element of `l` is less than the difference between `l[x]` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]` and `b` is the maximum of the first element of `l` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1`, or `l[x]` if the difference between `l[x]` and the first element of `l` is less than the difference between `l[x]` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]` and `b` is the maximum of the first element of `l` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1`, or `l[x]` if the difference between `l[x]` and the first element of `l` is less than the difference between `l[x]` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1`. Otherwise, `a` is either the first element of `l` or `l[x]`, whichever is smaller, and `b` is the maximum of the first element of `l` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1`, or `l[x]` if the difference between `l[x]` and the first element of `l` is less than the difference between `l[x]` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
