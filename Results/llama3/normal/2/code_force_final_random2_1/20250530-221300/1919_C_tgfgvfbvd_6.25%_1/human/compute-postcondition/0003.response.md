Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is an integer equal to the first element of `l`, `b` is 0, `c` is 0, `y` is 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The current value of `l[y]` is greater than the current value of `l[y - 1]`***
