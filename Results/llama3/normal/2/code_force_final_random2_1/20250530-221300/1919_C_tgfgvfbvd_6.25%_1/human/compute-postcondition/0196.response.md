Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It then processes the list to find the number of elements that are either greater than or less than the previous elements, and updates two variables (a and b) accordingly. The function prints the count of such elements (c) for each test case.**
