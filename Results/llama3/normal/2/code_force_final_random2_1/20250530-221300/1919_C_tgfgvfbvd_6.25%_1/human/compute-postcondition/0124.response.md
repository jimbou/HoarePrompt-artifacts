Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than `x`, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is `n - 1`, `_` is 1, `x` is at least `y + 3` (which is `n + 1`), `c` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `a` is `l[x]` and `b` is the maximum of the first element of `l` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1`, or `l[x]` if the difference between `l[x]` and the first element of `l` is less than the difference between `l[x]` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1`. Otherwise, `a` is the smaller of the first element of `l` and `l[x]`, and `b` is `l[x]`.***
