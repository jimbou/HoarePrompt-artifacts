Output State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is `n - 1`, `_` is 1, `x` is `n`, `a` is the minimum of the elements of `l`, `b` is the maximum of the elements of `l`, `c` is the number of elements in `l` that are greater than the minimum of the elements of `l` and less than the maximum of the elements of `l`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` remains an integer, `l` remains a list of integers, `y` remains `n - 1`, and `_` remains 1. The variable `x` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements of `l`. The variable `a` is now the minimum of the elements of `l`, and `b` is the maximum of the elements of `l`. The variable `c` is the number of elements in `l` that are greater than the minimum of the elements of `l` and less than the maximum of the elements of `l`.
