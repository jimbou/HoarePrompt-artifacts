Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is an integer less than `n`, `_` is 2, `x` is `y + 1`, `c` is 0, `stdin` is empty. Either `l[x]` is not greater than `a` or `l[x]` is not greater than `b`. Either `l[x]` is not less than `a` or `l[x]` is not less than `b`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `a` is equal to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is equal to `l[x]` and `a` is less than `l[x]`.***
