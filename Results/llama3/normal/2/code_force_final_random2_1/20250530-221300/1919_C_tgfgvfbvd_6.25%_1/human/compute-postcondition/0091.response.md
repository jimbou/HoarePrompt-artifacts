Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than `y + 1`, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is `n - 1`, `_` is 1, `x` is at least `y + 1` (which is `n`), `a` is the first element of `l`, `b` is equal to `l[x]`, `c` is 0, the current value of `l[x]` is less than `a` and less than the previous value of `b`, and `a - l[x]` is greater than the previous value of `b - l[x]`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to be equal to `l[x]`, which is less than the previous value of `b` and also less than `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
