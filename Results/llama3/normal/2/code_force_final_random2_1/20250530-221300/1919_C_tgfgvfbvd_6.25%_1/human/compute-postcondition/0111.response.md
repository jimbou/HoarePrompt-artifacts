Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than `y + 1`, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is `n - 1`, `_` is 1, `x` is at least `y + 2` (which is `n`), `c` is either 0 or 1. If `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `a` is set to `l[x]` and `b` is the maximum of the first element of `l` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1`. Otherwise, `a` is either the first element of `l` or `l[x]`, whichever is smaller, and `b` is `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and the maximum of the first element of `l` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1`, then `c` is 1. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and the maximum of the first element of `l` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1`, then `c` is 0. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` but not less than the maximum of the first element of `l` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1`, then `a` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to the maximum of the first element of `l` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1` but not less than `a`, then `a` is less than `l[x]`.***
