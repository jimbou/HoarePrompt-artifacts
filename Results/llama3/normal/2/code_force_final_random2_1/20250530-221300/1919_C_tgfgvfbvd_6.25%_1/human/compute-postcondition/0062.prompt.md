Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, l is a list of integers, a is an integer equal to the first element of l, b is equal to the first element of l that is greater than the previous element or 0 if no such element exists, y is equal to n, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
        if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
        c += 1
    elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
        if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    elif a >= l[x]:
        a = l[x]
    else:
        b = l[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is either the first element of `l` or the element of `l` that is closest to the previous element, `b` is either the first element of `l` that is greater than the previous element or the element of `l` that is closest to the previous element, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `_` is 0, `x` is `y + 1`, `c` is increased by 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, otherwise `c` remains unchanged. Either `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then either `a` is updated to `l[x]` if the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]`. Otherwise, either `a` is equal to `l[x]` or `b` is equal to `l[x]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is less than `n - 2`, `_` is 0, `x` is `y + 2`. Either `a` is the first element of `l` or the element of `l` that is closest to the previous element, and either `b` is the first element of `l` that is greater than the previous element or the element of `l` that is closest to the previous element. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `c` remains unchanged. Either `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then either `a` is updated to `l[x]` if the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]`. Otherwise, either `a` is equal to `l[x]` or `b` is equal to `l[x]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `_` is 0, `x` is `y + 3`. Either `a` is the first element of `l`, the element of `l` that is closest to the previous element, or `l[x]`, and either `b` is the first element of `l` that is greater than the previous element, the element of `l` that is closest to the previous element, or `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `c` remains unchanged. Either `a` is updated to `l[x]` if the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` if the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is greater than the difference between `b` and `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to both `a` and `b`, then either `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `b` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
