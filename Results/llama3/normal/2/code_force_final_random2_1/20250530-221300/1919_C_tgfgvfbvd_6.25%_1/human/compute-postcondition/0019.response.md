Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `_` is 0, `x` is `y + 1`. The current value of `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `l[x]` is greater than `b`. If the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`.**
