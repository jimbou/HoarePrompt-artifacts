To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `y` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `y` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `y` needs to be incremented by 1, so `y` becomes 2.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables, such as `l`, `x`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `stdin`, are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is 2, `_` is 2, `x` is equal to `n`, `a` is the first element of `l`, `b` is 0 or the second element of `l` (if it is greater than the first element of `l`), `c` is 0, stdin is empty.**
