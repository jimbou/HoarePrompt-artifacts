Output State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `_` is 0, `x` is `y + 3`, `a` is either the first element of `l` or the element of `l` that is closest to the previous element, `b` is `l[x]`, `c` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, and either `a` is equal to `l[x]` or `a` is updated to `l[x]` if the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` is updated to `l[x]`, which is the element of `l` at index `x`. The values of `n`, `l`, `y`, `_`, and `x` remain unchanged. The value of `c` may be increased by 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, or it remains unchanged. The value of `a` may be updated to `l[x]` if the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, or it remains unchanged.
