Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is an integer equal to the first element of `l`, `b` is equal to the first element of `l` that is greater than the previous element or 0 if no such element exists, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `_` is 0, `x` is `y + 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The current value of `l[x]` is less than `a` and less than `b`. Either `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`.**
