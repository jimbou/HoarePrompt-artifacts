The only variable in the loop head is variable  x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `n`. If `x` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is `y + 2`, `n` is greater than `y`. For the loop to execute again `x` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `y + 3`.
State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is an integer less than `n`, `_` is 2, `x` is `y + 3`, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2. `a` and `b` are either the current or previous values of `l[x]` or the first element of `l`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 2. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b` but not the maximum, then `c` is 1. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 0. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then either `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, in which case `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, otherwise `b` is set to `l[x]` and `a` is less than `l[x]`, or `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, in which case `a` is set to `l[x]` if the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, otherwise `b` is set to `l[x]`. The difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b` if `a` is the current value of `l[x]`, otherwise the difference between `l[x]` and `b` is less than the difference between `l[x]` and `a` if `b` is the current value of `l[x]`.**
