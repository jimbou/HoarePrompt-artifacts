Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, l is a list of integers, y is equal to n, _ is 2, x is equal to n, a is the first element of l, b is the first element in l that is greater than the previous element or 0 if no such element exists, c is 0, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
        if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
        c += 1
    elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
        if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    elif a >= l[x]:
        a = l[x]
    else:
        b = l[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is an integer less than `n`, `_` is 2, `x` is `y + 1`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `a` and `b` are either the current or previous values of `l[x]` or the first element of `l`, and the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b` if `a` is the current value of `l[x]`, otherwise the difference between `l[x]` and `b` is less than the difference between `l[x]` and `a` if `b` is the current value of `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 1. Otherwise, `c` is 0. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then either `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, in which case `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, otherwise `b` is set to `l[x]` and `a` is less than `l[x]`, or `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, in which case `a` is set to `l[x]` if the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, otherwise `b` is set to `l[x]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is an integer less than `n`, `_` is 2, `x` is `y + 2`, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2. `a` and `b` are either the current or previous values of `l[x]` or the first element of `l`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 2. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b` but not the maximum, then `c` is 1. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 0. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then either `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, in which case `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, otherwise `b` is set to `l[x]` and `a` is less than `l[x]`, or `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, in which case `a` is set to `l[x]` if the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, otherwise `b` is set to `l[x]`. The difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b` if `a` is the current value of `l[x]`, otherwise the difference between `l[x]` and `b` is less than the difference between `l[x]` and `a` if `b` is the current value of `l[x]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is an integer less than `n`, `_` is 2, `x` is `y + 3`. `a` and `b` are either the current or previous values of `l[x]` or the first element of `l`. `c` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 3 if `l[x]` is the maximum, otherwise `c` is 2. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b` but not the maximum, otherwise `c` is 0. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then either `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, in which case `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, otherwise `b` is set to `l[x]` and `a` is less than `l[x]`, or `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, in which case `a` is set to `l[x]` if the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, otherwise `b` is set to `l[x]`. The difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b` if `a` is the current value of `l[x]`, otherwise the difference between `l[x]` and `b` is less than the difference between `l[x]` and `a` if `b` is the current value of `l[x]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
