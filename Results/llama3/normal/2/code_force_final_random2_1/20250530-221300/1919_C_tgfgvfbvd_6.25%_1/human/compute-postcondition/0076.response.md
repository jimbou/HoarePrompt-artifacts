Postcondition: ***n is an integer that must be at least 3, l is a list of integers, y is 3, _ is 1, x is n, a is the first element of l, c is 0. If the element of l at index y (which is 3) is greater than the element of l at index y - 1 (which is 2), then b is set to the value of the element of l at index y (which is 3). Otherwise, b remains 0.***
