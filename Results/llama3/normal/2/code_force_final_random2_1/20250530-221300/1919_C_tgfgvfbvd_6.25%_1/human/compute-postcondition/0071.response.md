State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is 2, `_` is 1, `x` is `n`, `a` is the first element of `l`, `c` is 0. If the second element of `l` is greater than the first element of `l`, then `b` is set to the value of the second element of `l`. Otherwise, `b` remains 0.**
