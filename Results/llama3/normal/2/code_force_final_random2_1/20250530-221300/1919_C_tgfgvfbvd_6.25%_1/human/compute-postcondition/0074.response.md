To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `y` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is 2 and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be incremented by 1, so `y` becomes 3.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables, `l`, `_`, `x`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, are not part of the loop head and their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **n is an integer that must be at least 3, l is a list of integers, y is 3, _ is 1, x is n, a is the first element of l, c is 0. If the second element of l is greater than the first element of l, then b is set to the value of the second element of l. Otherwise, b remains 0.**
