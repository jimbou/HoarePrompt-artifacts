Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is an integer less than `n`, `_` is 2, `x` is `y + 3`, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2. `a` and `b` are either the current or previous values of `l[x]` or the first element of `l`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is the current value of `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, otherwise `b` is the current value of `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is the current value of `l[x]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, otherwise `b` is set to `l[x]` and `a` is less than `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 2. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b` but not the maximum, then `c` is 1. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 0.***
