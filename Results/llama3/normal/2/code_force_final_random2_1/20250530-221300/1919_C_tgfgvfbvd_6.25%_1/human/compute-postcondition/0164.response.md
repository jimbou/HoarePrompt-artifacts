Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is an integer less than `n`, `_` is 2, `x` is `y + 1`, `c` is 0, `stdin` is empty. Either `l[x]` is not greater than `a` or `l[x]` is not greater than `b`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]` if the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is set to `l[x]` and `a` is less than `l[x]`.***
