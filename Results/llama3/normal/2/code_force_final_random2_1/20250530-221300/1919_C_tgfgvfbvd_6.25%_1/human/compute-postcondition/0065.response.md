The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `int(input())`. If `_` is less than `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `int(input())` is an integer. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is equal to `n`, `_` is 1, `x` is `n`, `a` is either the first element of `l` or the element of `l` that is closest to the previous element, `b` is either the first element of `l` that is greater than the previous element or the element of `l` that is closest to the previous element, `c` is increased by 1 for each `l[x]` that is greater than both `a` and `b`, and the value of `c` is being printed**
