Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to split the input array into two subsequences and calculate the minimum possible penalty. The program initializes two variables `a` and `b` to the first element of the array and then iterates through the rest of the array. For each element, it checks if it is greater than or less than the previous elements and updates `a` and `b` accordingly. The program also keeps track of the count of elements that are either greater than or less than the previous elements, which is the penalty.

The program correctly handles the cases where the input array has only one element, and it also correctly handles the cases where the input array has multiple elements. The program also correctly prints the minimum possible penalty for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
