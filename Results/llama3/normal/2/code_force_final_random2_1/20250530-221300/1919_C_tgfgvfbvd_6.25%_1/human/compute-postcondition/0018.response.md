Output State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is an integer equal to the first element of `l`, `b` is equal to `l[x]`, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `_` is 0, `x` is `y + 1`. The current value of `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `l[x]` is greater than `b`. stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The difference between `l[x]` and `a` is less than the difference between `l[x]` and `b` is no longer valid because `b` is now equal to `l[x]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `b` has been updated to be equal to the current value of `l[x]`, which is greater than `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The difference between `l[x]` and `a` is still valid, but the difference between `l[x]` and `b` is no longer valid because `b` is now equal to `l[x]`.
