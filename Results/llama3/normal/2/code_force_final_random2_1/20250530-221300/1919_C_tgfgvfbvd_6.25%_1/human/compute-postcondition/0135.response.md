Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is 1, `_` is 2, `x` is equal to `n`, `a` is the first element of `l`, `b` is 0, `c` is 0, stdin is empty. If the second element of `l` is greater than the first element of `l`, then `b` is set to the second element of `l`.***
