To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `y`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `x` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is `y + 1`, and `y` is less than `n - 1`. To execute the loop again, `x` must be incremented by 1, so `x` becomes `y + 2`.

Since `y` is not explicitly updated in the loop body, its value remains the same. However, we can infer that `y` must be less than `n - 2` for the loop to execute again, because `x` is now `y + 2` and must be less than `n`.

The other variables (`n`, `l`, `a`, `b`, `_`, and `c`) are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is either the first element of `l` or the element of `l` that is closest to the previous element, `b` is either the first element of `l` that is greater than the previous element or the element of `l` that is closest to the previous element, `y` is less than `n - 2`, `_` is 0, `x` is `y + 2`, `c` is increased by 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, otherwise `c` remains unchanged. Either `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then either `a` is updated to `l[x]` if the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]`. Otherwise, either `a` is equal to `l[x]` or `b` is equal to `l[x]`.**
