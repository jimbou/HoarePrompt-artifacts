To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`. Therefore, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is an integer equal to the first element of `l`, `b` is 0, `c` is 0, `y` is 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers**
