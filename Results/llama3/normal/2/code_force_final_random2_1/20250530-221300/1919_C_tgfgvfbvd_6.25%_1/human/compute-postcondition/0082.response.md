Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than `y + 1`, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is `n - 1`, `_` is 1, `x` is at least `y + 1` (which is `n`), `a` is the first element of `l`, `b` is the maximum of the first element of `l` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1`, `c` is 0. The current value of `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `b`. Additionally, `l[x] - a` is less than `l[x] - b`***
