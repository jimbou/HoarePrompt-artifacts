Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than `y + 1`, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is `n - 1`, `_` is 1, `x` is at least `y + 1` (which is `n`), `c` is 0, either `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, and it is not the case that `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `a` is set to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is set to `l[x]` and `a` is less than `l[x]`.***
