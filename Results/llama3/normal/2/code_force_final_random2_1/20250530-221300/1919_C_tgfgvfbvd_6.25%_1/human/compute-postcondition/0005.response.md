Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is an integer equal to the first element of `l`, `y` is 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If the second element of `l` is greater than the first element, then `b` is equal to the second element of `l` and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `b` and `c` remain 0.***
