The only variable in the loop head is variable  x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `n`. If `x` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is `y + 2`, `y` is less than `n - 2`. For the loop to execute again `x` must be `y + 3` and `y` must be less than `n - 1`.
State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `_` is 0, `x` is `y + 3`. Either `a` is the first element of `l` or the element of `l` that is closest to the previous element, and either `b` is the first element of `l` that is greater than the previous element or the element of `l` that is closest to the previous element. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `c` remains unchanged. Either `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then either `a` is updated to `l[x]` if the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]`. Otherwise, either `a` is equal to `l[x]` or `b` is equal to `l[x]`.**
