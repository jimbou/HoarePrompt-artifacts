The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_`. If `_` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is `n - 1`, `_` is 2, `x` is `n`, `a` is the minimum of the elements of `l`, `b` is the maximum of the elements of `l`, `c` is the number of elements in `l` that are greater than the minimum of the elements of `l` and less than the maximum of the elements of `l`**
