Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `_` is 0, `x` is `y + 3`. Either `a` is the first element of `l`, the element of `l` that is closest to the previous element, or `l[x]`, and either `b` is the first element of `l` that is greater than the previous element, the element of `l` that is closest to the previous element, or `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `c` remains unchanged. Either `a` is updated to `l[x]` if the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` if the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is greater than the difference between `b` and `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to both `a` and `b`, then either `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `b` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`.***
