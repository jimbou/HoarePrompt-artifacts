The only variable in the loop head is variable `y` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y` and `n`. If `y` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be increased by 1, so `y` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is an integer equal to the first element of `l`, `y` is 2, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If the second element of `l` is greater than the first element, then `b` is equal to the second element of `l` and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `b` and `c` remain 0.**
