Output State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is equal to `l[x]`, `b` is equal to the first element of `l` that is greater than the previous element or 0 if no such element exists, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `_` is 0, `x` is `y + 1`. The current value of `l[x]` is greater than the previous value of `a` and `l[x]` is greater than `b`. The difference between `l[x]` and the previous value of `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` has been updated to the current value of `l[x]`, which is greater than its previous value and also greater than `b`. The differences between `l[x]` and the previous value of `a` and between `l[x]` and `b` are still maintained. All other variables remain unchanged.
