Output State: **n is an integer from stdin, l is a list of integers from stdin, y is 0, _ is 2, x is n, a is the first element of l, b is 0, c is 0, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `n` is replaced by the integer value from stdin. The list `l` is now a list of integers from stdin. The value of `y` is set to 0. The value of `a` is now the first element of the list `l`. The value of `b` is set to 0. The value of `c` is set to 0. Stdin is now empty because two lines of input have been read. The values of `_` and `x` remain unchanged.
