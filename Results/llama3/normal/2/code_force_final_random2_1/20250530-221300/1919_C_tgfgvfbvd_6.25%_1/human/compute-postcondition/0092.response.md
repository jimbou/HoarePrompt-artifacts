Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than `y + 1`, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is `n - 1`, `_` is 1, `x` is at least `y + 1` (which is `n`), `c` is 0. If the difference between the first element of `l` and the current value of `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between the maximum of the first element of `l` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1` and the current value of `l[x]`, then `a` is the current value of `l[x]`, `b` is the maximum of the first element of `l` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1`, and the current value of `l[x]` is less than the previous value of `a` and less than `b`. Otherwise, `a` is the first element of `l`, `b` is equal to `l[x]`, and the current value of `l[x]` is less than `a` and less than the previous value of `b`, and the difference between the first element of `l` and the current value of `l[x]` is greater than the previous value of `b - l[x]`.**
