Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `_` is 0, `x` is `y + 3`. Either `a` is the first element of `l`, the element of `l` that is closest to the previous element, or `l[x]` if `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` and the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`. Either `b` is the first element of `l` that is greater than the previous element, the element of `l` that is closest to the previous element, or `l[x]` if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`. `c` is either increased by 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b` or remains unchanged. Either `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`.***
