Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum possible penalty by splitting an array into two subsequences. The program iterates through the array, maintaining two variables `a` and `b` to keep track of the maximum and minimum values seen so far. It updates these variables based on the comparison of the current element with the previous elements.

The program correctly implements the logic to split the array into two subsequences and calculate the penalty. It handles the cases where the current element is greater than or less than the previous elements, and updates the variables `a` and `b` accordingly.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the array has only one element, or when all elements are equal.

The output of the program matches the expected output for the given test cases, which further confirms its correctness.

Correctness: **True**
