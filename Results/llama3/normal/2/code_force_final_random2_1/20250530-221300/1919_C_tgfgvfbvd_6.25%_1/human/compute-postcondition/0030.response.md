Output State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is equal to `l[x]`, `b` is equal to the first element of `l` that is greater than the previous element or 0 if no such element exists, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `_` is 0, `x` is `y + 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The current value of `a` is equal to `l[x]`. Either `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` is updated to be equal to the element at index `x` in the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `a` and `l[x]` is now that they are equal, and the relationship between `l[x]` and `b` remains the same. The input state is also unchanged, with multiple test cases minus 2 inputs remaining in the standard input.
