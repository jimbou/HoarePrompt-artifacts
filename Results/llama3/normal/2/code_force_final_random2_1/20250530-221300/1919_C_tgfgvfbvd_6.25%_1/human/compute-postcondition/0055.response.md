Output State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `_` is 0, `x` is `y + 3`, `a` is either the first element of `l`, the element of `l` that is closest to the previous element, or `l[x]`, `b` is `l[x]`, and `c` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to `l[x]`. The value of `a` may have been updated to `l[x]` if the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, but this is not certain. The value of `c` may have been increased by 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, but this is also not certain. The values of `n`, `l`, `y`, `_`, and `x` remain unchanged.
