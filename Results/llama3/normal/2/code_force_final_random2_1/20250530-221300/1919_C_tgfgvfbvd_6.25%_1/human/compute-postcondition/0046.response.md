Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is either the first element of `l` or the element of `l` that is closest to the previous element, `b` is either the first element of `l` that is greater than the previous element or the element of `l` that is closest to the previous element, `y` is less than `n - 2`, `_` is 0, `x` is `y + 2`, `c` is increased by 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, otherwise `c` remains unchanged. Either `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then either `a` is updated to `l[x]` if the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]`. Otherwise, either `a` is equal to `l[x]` or `b` is equal to `l[x]`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`.**
