Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than `y + 1`, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is `n - 1`, `_` is 1, `x` is at least `y + 1` (which is `n`), `c` is 0. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is the current value of `l[x]`, `b` is the maximum of the first element of `l` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1`, and the current value of `l[x]` is less than the previous value of `a` and less than `b`. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` but not less than `b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b` but not less than `a`, then `b` is set to `l[x]` and `a` is less than `l[x]`.***
