Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `_` is 0, `x` is `y + 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. Either `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `a` and `a` is equal to `l[x]`, or `l[x]` is less than `a` and `b` is equal to `l[x]`.***
