Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to split the array into two subsequences and calculate the minimum possible penalty. The program iterates through the array, maintaining two variables `a` and `b` to keep track of the maximum values in the two subsequences. It updates these values based on the comparison of the current element with the previous elements in the subsequences. The program also keeps track of the number of times an element is added to a subsequence, which is used to calculate the penalty.

The program handles all possible cases, including when the array is already sorted, when the array has only one element, and when the array has multiple elements with the same value. The program also correctly handles the case when the array is split into two subsequences with different lengths.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
