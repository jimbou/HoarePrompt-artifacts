Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is an integer less than `n`, `_` is 2, `x` is `y + 1`, `c` is 0, `stdin` is empty. The current value of `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`. If the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`, then `a` is set to the current value of `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is set to the value of `l[x]`.***
