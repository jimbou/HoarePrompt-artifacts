Output State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is an integer less than `n`, `_` is 2, `x` is `y + 3`, `c` is either 1, 2, or 3. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 3. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b` but not the maximum, then `c` is 2. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 1. `a` and `b` are either the current or previous values of `l[x]` or the first element of `l`. If `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, then `a` is the current value of `l[x]` and `b` is either the previous value of `l[x]` or the first element of `l`. Otherwise, `b` is `l[x]` and `a` is either the current or previous values of `l[x]` or the first element of `l`. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then either `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, in which case `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, otherwise `b` is set to `l[x]` and `a` is less than `l[x]`, or `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, in which case `a` is set to `l[x]` if the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, otherwise `b` is set to `l[x]`. The difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b` if `a` is the current value of `l[x]`, otherwise the difference between `l[x]` and `b` is less than the difference between `l[x]` and `a` if `b` is the current value of `l[x]`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `c` has been incremented by 1, and its possible values are now 1, 2, or 3. The conditions for `c` being 1, 2, or 3 are the same as before, but now `c` can also be 3 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`. The values of the other variables remain the same, and the conditions for `a` and `b` being the current or previous values of `l[x]` or the first element of `l` also remain the same.
