Output State: **n is an integer that must be at least 3, l is a list of integers, y is 3, _ is 1, x is n, a is the first element of l, c is 0, b is the element of l at index y (which is 3)**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to the element of `l` at index `y`, which is 3. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of `b` is now the fourth element of the list `l`, since indexing starts at 0.
