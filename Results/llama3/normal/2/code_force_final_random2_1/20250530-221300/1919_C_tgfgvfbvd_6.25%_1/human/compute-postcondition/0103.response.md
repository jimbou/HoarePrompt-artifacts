Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than `y + 1`, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is `n - 1`, `_` is 1, `x` is at least `y + 2` (which is `n`), `a` is either the first element of `l` or `l[x]`, whichever is smaller, `b` is `l[x]`, and `c` is either 0 or 1. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and the maximum of the first element of `l` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1`, then `c` is 1. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and the maximum of the first element of `l` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1`, then `c` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to `l[x]`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The conditions for `c` being 0 or 1 are still dependent on the relative values of `l[x]`, `a`, and the maximum of the first element of `l` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1`.
