The code prints the value of `c`, which is the number of elements in the list `l` that are greater than the minimum of the elements of `l` (denoted by `a`) and less than the maximum of the elements of `l` (denoted by `b`).

Since the exact list `l` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `c`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the count of elements in `l` that fall within the range (a, b).

Output: **the number of elements in list l that are greater than a (the minimum of the elements of l) and less than b (the maximum of the elements of l)**
