Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is an integer less than `n`, `_` is 2, `x` is `y + 1`, `a` is the first element of `l`, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than the previous element or 0 if no such element exists, `c` is 0, `stdin` is empty. Either `l[x]` is not greater than `a` or `l[x]` is not greater than `b`. The current value of `l[x]` is less than `a` and `l[x]` is also less than `b`. Additionally, the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is greater than the difference between `b` and `l[x]`.***
