Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 2, l is a list of integers, y is 2, _ is 2, x is equal to n, a is the first element of l, c is 0, stdin is empty. If the third element of l is greater than the second element of l, then b is the third element of l. Otherwise, b is 0 or the second element of l (if it is greater than the first element of l).***
