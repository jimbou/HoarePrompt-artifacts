Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is an integer equal to the first element of `l`, `b` is equal to the first element of `l` that is greater than the previous element or 0 if no such element exists, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `_` is 0, `x` is `y + 1`. The current value of `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `l[x]` is greater than `b`. stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.**
