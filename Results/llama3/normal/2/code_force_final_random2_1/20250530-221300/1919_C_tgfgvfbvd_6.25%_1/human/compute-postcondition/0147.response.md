Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is an integer less than `n`, `_` is 2, `x` is `y + 1`, `a` is the first element of `l`, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than the previous element or 0 if no such element exists, `c` is 0, `stdin` is empty. The current value of `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`. The difference between `l[x]` and `a` is less than the difference between `l[x]` and `b`.***
