Output State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is equal to `l[x]`, `b` is equal to the first element of `l` that is greater than the previous element or 0 if no such element exists, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `_` is 0, `x` is `y + 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The current value of `l[x]` is less than the previous value of `a` and less than `b`. Either `l[x]` is less than or equal to the previous value of `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`. The difference between the previous value of `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to be equal to the current value of `l[x]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to the values of `l[x]`, `a`, and `b` are still valid, but now they refer to the updated value of `a`.
