Output State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is an integer equal to the first element of `l`, `b` is equal to `l[x]`, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `_` is 0, `x` is `y + 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. Either `l[x]` is less than `a` and `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `b`**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to be equal to `l[x]`, which is the element at index `x` in the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that either `l[x]` is less than `a` and `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `b` is still valid, but now `b` has a new value.
