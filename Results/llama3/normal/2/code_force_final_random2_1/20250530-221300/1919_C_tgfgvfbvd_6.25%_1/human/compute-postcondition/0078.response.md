To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `x`, `y`, and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `y + 1` is less than `n`. Since `y` is `n - 1`, we can simplify this condition to `n - 1 + 1 < n`, which is always true. However, we need to consider the initial value of `x`, which is `n`.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of `x` to be at least `y + 1`, which is `n`. We also need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than `y + 1`, which is `n`.

The other variables `l`, `_`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not relevant to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than `y + 1`, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is `n - 1`, `_` is 1, `x` is at least `y + 1` (which is `n`), `a` is the first element of `l`, `b` is the maximum of the first element of `l` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1`, `c` is 0**
