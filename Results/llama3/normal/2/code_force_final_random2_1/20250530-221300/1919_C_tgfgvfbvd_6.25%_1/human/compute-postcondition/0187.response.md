Output State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is an integer less than `n`, `_` is 2, `x` is `y + 3`, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2. `a` is the current value of `l[x]`, `b` is either the previous value of `l[x]` or the first element of `l`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 2. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b` but not the maximum, then `c` is 1. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to be the current value of `l[x]`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` is still maintained, but now `a` is guaranteed to be the current value of `l[x]`.
