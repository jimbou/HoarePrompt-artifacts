Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `_` is 0, `x` is `y + 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. Either `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then either `a` is updated to `l[x]` if the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]`. Otherwise, either `a` is equal to `l[x]` or `b` is equal to `l[x]`.**
