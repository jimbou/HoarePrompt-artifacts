The only objects in the loop head are variable `_` and the input() function, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input() function. If the input() function returns at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the input() function must return at least 1 integer and the variable `_` is 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, input() function returns at least 1 integer, `_` is 0**
