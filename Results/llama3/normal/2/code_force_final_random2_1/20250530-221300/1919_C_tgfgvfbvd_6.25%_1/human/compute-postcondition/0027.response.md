Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `_` is 0, `x` is `y + 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. `a` is either equal to `l[x]` or the first element of `l`. `b` is either equal to the first element of `l` that is greater than the previous element or `l[x]`. The current value of `l[x]` is less than `a` and less than `b`. Either `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`. If the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`.***
