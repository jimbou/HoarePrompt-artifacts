To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `y` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute because `y` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`. 

Before the loop starts, `y` is 0, which does not ensure that the loop will execute. So, we need to adjust `y` to be 1, which is the starting value of the loop. We also need to adjust `n` to be at least 2, so the loop can execute at least once.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is 1, `_` is 1, `x` is `n`, `a` is the first element of `l`, `b` is 0, `c` is 0**
