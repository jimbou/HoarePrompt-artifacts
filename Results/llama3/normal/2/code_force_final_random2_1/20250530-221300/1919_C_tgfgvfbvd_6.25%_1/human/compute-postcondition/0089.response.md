Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than `y + 1`, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is `n - 1`, `_` is 1, `x` is at least `y + 1` (which is `n`), `a` is the current value of `l[x]`, `b` is the maximum of the first element of `l` and the maximum of the elements of `l` from index 1 to `n - 1`, `c` is 0. The current value of `l[x]` is less than the previous value of `a` and less than `b`. Additionally, the difference between the previous value of `a` and the current value of `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and the current value of `l[x]`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to the current value of `l[x]`, which is less than the previous value of `a` and less than `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
