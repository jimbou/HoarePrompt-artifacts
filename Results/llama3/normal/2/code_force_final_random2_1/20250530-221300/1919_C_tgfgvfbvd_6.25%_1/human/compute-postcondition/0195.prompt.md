Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = l[0]
    b = 0
    c = 0
    y = 0
    for y in range(1, n):
        if l[y] > l[y - 1]:
            b = l[y]
            break
    for x in range(y + 1, n):
        if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
            if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
                a = l[x]
            else:
                b = l[x]
            c += 1
        elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
            if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
                a = l[x]
            else:
                b = l[x]
        elif a >= l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    print(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is equal to `n`, `_` is 0, `x` is `n`, `a` is either the first element of `l` or the element of `l` that is closest to the previous element, `b` is either the first element of `l` that is greater than the previous element or the element of `l` that is closest to the previous element, `c` is increased by 1 for each `l[x]` that is greater than both `a` and `b`, and the value of `c` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is `n - 1`, `_` is 1, `x` is `n`, `a` is the minimum of the elements of `l`, `b` is the maximum of the elements of `l`, `c` is the number of elements in `l` that are greater than the minimum of the elements of `l` and less than the maximum of the elements of `l`, and the number of elements in `l` that are greater than the minimum of the elements of `l` and less than the maximum of the elements of `l` which is `c` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, l is a list of integers, y is an integer less than n, _ is 2, x is n, c is an integer between 0 and n - y - 1, a and b are either the current or previous values of l[x] or the first element of l, and an integer c between 0 and n - y - 1 is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
