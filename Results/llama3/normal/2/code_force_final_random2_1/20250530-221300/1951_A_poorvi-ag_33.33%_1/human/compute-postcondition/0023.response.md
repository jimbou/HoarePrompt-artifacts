Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, n is an integer, arr is a string. If arr contains exactly two '1's and '11' is a substring of arr, then results is a list containing the string 'no' or 'no' twice. If arr contains an even number of '1's but not exactly two '1's and '11' is a substring of arr, then results is a list containing the string 'yes'. If arr contains an even number of '1's but not exactly two '1's and '11' is not a substring of arr, then results is a list containing the string 'yes'. If arr contains an odd number of '1's, then results is a list containing the string 'no' once.***
