According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer, `results` is an empty list, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case. So for the loop to be executed, `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is 0**
