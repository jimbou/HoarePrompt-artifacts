The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `t` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' is a substring of `arr`, then `results` is a list containing the string 'no' or 'no' twice. If `arr` contains an even number of '1's but not exactly two '1's and '11' is a substring of `arr`, then `results` is a list containing the string 'yes'. If `arr` contains an even number of '1's but not exactly two '1's and '11' is not a substring of `arr`, then `results` is a list containing the string 'yes'. If `arr` contains an odd number of '1's, then `results` is a list containing the string 'no' once.**
