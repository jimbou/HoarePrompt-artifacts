Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the number of lamps is 1 and the desired configuration is '1'. In this case, the program will print 'no', but the correct answer is 'yes' because we can turn on the only lamp. 

Also, the program has redundant conditions. The condition `if arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr:` is checked twice, which is unnecessary. 

The program can be simplified and corrected by removing the redundant conditions and handling the case when the number of lamps is 1.
