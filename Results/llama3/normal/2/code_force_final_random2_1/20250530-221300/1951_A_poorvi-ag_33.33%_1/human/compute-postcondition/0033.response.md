Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is t, n is an integer, arr is a string, results is a list containing the string 'yes' or 'no' t times. If arr contains an even number of '1's, then 'yes' is added to results if arr does not contain exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring. Otherwise, 'no' is added to results. If arr contains an odd number of '1's, then 'no' is added to results once if arr does not contain exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring. Otherwise, 'no' is added to results twice.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` will be greater than or equal to 0, and the value of `i` will be equal to `t`. The value of `n` will be an integer, and the value of `arr` will be a string. The value of `results` will be a list containing the string 'yes' or 'no' `t` times. The contents of the `results` list will depend on the number of '1's in `arr` and whether '11' is a substring of `arr`. If `arr` contains an even number of '1's, then 'yes' will be added to `results` if `arr` does not contain exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring. Otherwise, 'no' will be added to `results`. If `arr` contains an odd number of '1's, then 'no' will be added to `results` once if `arr` does not contain exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring. Otherwise, 'no' will be added to `results` twice.
