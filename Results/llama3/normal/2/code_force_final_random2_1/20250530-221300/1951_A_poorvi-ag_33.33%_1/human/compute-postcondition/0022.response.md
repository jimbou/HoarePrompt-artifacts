Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' is a substring of `arr`, then `results` is a list containing the string 'no' twice. Otherwise, `results` is a list containing the string 'no' once.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still an integer greater than 1, `i` is still 1, and `n` is still an integer. The string `arr` remains unchanged. The list `results` now contains the string 'no' either once or twice, depending on whether `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' is a substring of `arr`.
