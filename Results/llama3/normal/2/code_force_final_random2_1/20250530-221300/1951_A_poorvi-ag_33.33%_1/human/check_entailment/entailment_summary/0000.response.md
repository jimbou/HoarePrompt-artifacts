Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether a given binary string can be reached by turning on non-adjacent lamps. The program checks for the following conditions:

1. If the string contains exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring, it is not possible to reach this configuration, so it appends 'no' to the results list.
2. If the string contains an even number of '1's, it is possible to reach this configuration, so it appends 'yes' to the results list.
3. If the string contains an odd number of '1's, it is not possible to reach this configuration, so it appends 'no' to the results list.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
