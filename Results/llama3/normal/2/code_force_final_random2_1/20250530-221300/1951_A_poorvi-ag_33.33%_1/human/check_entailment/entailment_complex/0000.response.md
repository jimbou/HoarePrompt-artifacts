Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether a given binary string can be reached by applying the given operation any number of times. 

The program first checks if the string contains an even number of '1's. If it does, it then checks if the string contains exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring. If it does, it appends 'no' to the results list. Otherwise, it appends 'yes' to the results list. If the string contains an odd number of '1's, it appends 'no' to the results list.

This logic is correct because the given operation can only turn on two non-adjacent lamps at a time. Therefore, if the string contains an odd number of '1's, it is impossible to reach that configuration. If the string contains an even number of '1's, it is possible to reach that configuration unless the string contains exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring, in which case it is also impossible to reach that configuration.

Correctness: **True**
