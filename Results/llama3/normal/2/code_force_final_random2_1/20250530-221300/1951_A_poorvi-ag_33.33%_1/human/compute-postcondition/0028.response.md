Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `results` is a list containing the string 'yes' or 'no' once or twice or thrice. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring, then 'no' is added to `results`. Otherwise, 'no' is added to `results` anyway.**

In this output state, the value of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `arr` remains the same as in the initial state. However, the value of `results` has been updated to include 'no' regardless of the conditions. The list `results` now contains 'yes' or 'no' once or twice or thrice.
