Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `results` is a list containing two elements 'no', `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string. The number of '1' characters in `arr` is odd.**

In this output state, the value of `results` has been updated to contain two elements 'no', since the code appends 'no' to the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that the number of '1' characters in `arr` is odd is still valid.
