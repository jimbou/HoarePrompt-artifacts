The code `results.append('no')` appends the string 'no' to the list `results`. The initial state of `results` is an empty list, so after the code is executed, `results` will contain one element, which is the string 'no'.

The other variables in the initial state are not affected by the code. The value of `t` is still an integer greater than 0, `i` is still 0, `n` is still an integer, and `arr` is still a string containing exactly two '1' characters and '11' is a substring of `arr`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `results` is a list containing one element 'no', `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string containing exactly two '1' characters and '11' is a substring of `arr`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**
