Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `t`, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `results` is a list containing the string 'yes' or 'no' `t` times, and all elements in the list which are 'yes' or 'no' have been printed**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that all elements in the `results` list have been printed. The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list and prints it. Since the loop executes for all elements in the list, all 'yes' or 'no' strings in the list will be printed. The state of the other variables remains unchanged as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
