Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' is a substring of `arr`, then `results` is a list containing the strings 'no' and 'yes'. Otherwise, `results` is a list containing the string 'yes'.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The only change is in the `results` list. If the condition is met, the list contains both 'no' and 'yes', otherwise, it only contains 'yes'.
