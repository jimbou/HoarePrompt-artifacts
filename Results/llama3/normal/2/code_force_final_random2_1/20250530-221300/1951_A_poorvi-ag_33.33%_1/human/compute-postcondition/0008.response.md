Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `results` is a list containing two elements 'no', `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string. The count of '1' in `arr` is 2 and '11' is a substring of `arr`. The count of '1' in `arr` is even.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `results` now contains two elements 'no', as the code appended another 'no' to the list. The other variables remain unchanged.
