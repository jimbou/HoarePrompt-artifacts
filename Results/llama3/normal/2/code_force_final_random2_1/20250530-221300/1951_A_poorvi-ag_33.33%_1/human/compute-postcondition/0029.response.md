Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `results` is a list containing the string 'yes' or 'no' once or twice or thrice. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring, then 'no' is added to `results`. Otherwise, no change is made to `results` and 'yes' is added to `results`**.

In natural language, the output state is that all variables maintain their initial state except for the `results` list, which now contains an additional 'yes' element. The condition regarding the `arr` string and the 'no' element in the `results` list remains unchanged.
