Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, results is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, i is 0, n is an integer, arr is a string**.

The code executes two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `t` is an integer greater than 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, after this line executes, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. The second line assigns the string value of the input to `arr`. No other variables are affected.
