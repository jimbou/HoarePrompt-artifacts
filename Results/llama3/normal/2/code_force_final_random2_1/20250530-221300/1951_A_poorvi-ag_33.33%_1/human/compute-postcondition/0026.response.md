Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `results` is a list containing the string 'yes' or 'no' once or twice and 'no'**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 2, `i` is still 2, `n` is still an integer, `arr` is still a string, and `results` is still a list containing the string 'yes' or 'no' once or twice, but now it also contains an additional 'no' at the end.
