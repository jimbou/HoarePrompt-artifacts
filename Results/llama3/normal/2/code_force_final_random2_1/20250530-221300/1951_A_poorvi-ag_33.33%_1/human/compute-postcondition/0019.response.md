Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `results` is a list containing the string 'no'. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' is a substring of `arr`, then this state is the same as the initial state except for `results`. Otherwise, the state is the same as the initial state.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that the list `results` now contains the string 'no'. The other variables remain unchanged.
