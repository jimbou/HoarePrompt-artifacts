Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `results` is a list containing the string 'yes' or 'no' once, twice or thrice. If `arr` contains an even number of '1's, then 'yes' is added to `results` if `arr` does not contain exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring. Otherwise, 'no' is added to `results`. If `arr` contains an odd number of '1's, then 'no' is added to `results` once if `arr` does not contain exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring. Otherwise, 'no' is added to `results` twice.***
