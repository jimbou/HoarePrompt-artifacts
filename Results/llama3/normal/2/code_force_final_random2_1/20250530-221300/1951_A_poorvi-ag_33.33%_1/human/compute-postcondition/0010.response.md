Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `results` is a list containing 'yes', `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string. The current value of the count of '1' in `arr` is even. Either the count of '1' in `arr` is not equal to 2 or '11' is not a substring of `arr`.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `results` now contains the string 'yes'. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
