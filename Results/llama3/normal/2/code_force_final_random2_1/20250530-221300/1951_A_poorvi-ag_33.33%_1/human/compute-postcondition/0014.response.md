Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer, arr is a string. If arr contains exactly two '1' characters and '11' is a substring of arr, the list results contains two elements 'no'. If arr contains exactly two '1' characters but '11' is not a substring of arr, the list results contains one element 'yes'. If arr does not contain exactly two '1' characters, the list results contains one element 'yes' if the count of '1' in arr is even, otherwise the list results contains two elements 'no'.***
