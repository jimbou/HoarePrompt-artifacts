Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer, arr is a string. If arr contains exactly two '1' characters and '11' is a substring of arr, the list results contains two elements 'no'. Otherwise, the list results contains one element 'yes'. In both cases, the count of '1' in arr is even.***
