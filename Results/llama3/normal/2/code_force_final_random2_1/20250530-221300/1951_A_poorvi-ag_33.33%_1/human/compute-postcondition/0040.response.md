The only object in the loop head is variable `r` and list `results`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `results`. If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 2 elements, the second element in the list which is 'yes' or 'no' is being printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the `r` is the third element in the list.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `t`, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `results` is a list containing the string 'yes' or 'no' `t` times that must have at least 3 elements, and the third element in the list which is 'yes' or 'no' is being printed, `r` is the third element in the list**
