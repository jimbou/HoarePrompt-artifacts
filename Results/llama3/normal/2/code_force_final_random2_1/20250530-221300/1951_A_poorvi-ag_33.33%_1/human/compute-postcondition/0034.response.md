According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. If `results` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `t`, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, and `results` is a list containing the string 'yes' or 'no' `t` times. So for the loop to be executed, `results` must have at least 1 element and `r` is the first element in the list.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `t`, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `results` is a list containing the string 'yes' or 'no' `t` times that must have at least 1 element, `r` is the first element in the list**
