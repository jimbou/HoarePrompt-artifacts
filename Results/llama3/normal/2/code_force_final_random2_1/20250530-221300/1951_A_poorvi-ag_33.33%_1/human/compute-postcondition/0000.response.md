Output State: **t is an integer, results is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since `t` is an integer, it now holds the value of the first input from stdin, which is an integer. The second line initializes an empty list called `results`. No other variables are affected. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one test case.
