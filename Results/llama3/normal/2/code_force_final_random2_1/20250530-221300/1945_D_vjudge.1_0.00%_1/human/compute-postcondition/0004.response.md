Output State: **`numero_testes` is greater than -1 and the function `func_1()` has been executed twice.**

In this output state, the value of `numero_testes` remains greater than -1, and the function `func_1()` has been executed twice. The execution of the function `func_1()` again does not change the value of `numero_testes`, but it does change the fact that the function has been executed twice.
