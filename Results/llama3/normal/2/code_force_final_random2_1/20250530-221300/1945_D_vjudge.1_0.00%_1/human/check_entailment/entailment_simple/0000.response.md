Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The program first reads the input data, reverses the lists of integers, and initializes the necessary variables. It then iterates through the lists, updating the `pref` and `soma_b` variables according to the problem's conditions. Finally, it finds the minimum value of `resultado` by iterating through the last `k` elements of the lists and prints the result.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when `k` is equal to `n`, and it also correctly calculates the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach the desired position.

Correctness: **True**
