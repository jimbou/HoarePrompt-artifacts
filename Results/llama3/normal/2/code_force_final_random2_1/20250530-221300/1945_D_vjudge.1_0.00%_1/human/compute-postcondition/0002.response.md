Output State: **`numero_testes` is greater than 0 and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**

The code calls the function `func_1()`, which means that the function's body will be executed. However, since we don't have any information about what the function `func_1()` does, we can't determine any changes to the variables. The only thing we can say for sure is that the function has been executed. The value of `numero_testes` is still greater than 0, as the code doesn't modify it.
