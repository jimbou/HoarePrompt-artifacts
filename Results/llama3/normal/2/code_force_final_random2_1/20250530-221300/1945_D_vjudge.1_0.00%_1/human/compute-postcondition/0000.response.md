Output State: **`numero_testes` is an integer, stdin contains multiple sets of input data. Each set of input data contains two lines: the first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= m <= n <= 200,000), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n separated by spaces (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n separated by spaces (1 <= b_i <= 10^9).**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `numero_testes` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, and the remaining input data is still available in the stdin, containing multiple sets of input data, each consisting of two lines of integers and a third line of integers.
