According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `numero_testes`. If `numero_testes` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `numero_testes` is an integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `numero_testes` is greater than 0.

State: **`numero_testes` is greater than 0**
