To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states accordingly.


The loop head is `for i in range(n - k):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`, and `k`.


At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. So, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be less than `n - k`. Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` should be `i + 1`.


The state of `n` and `k` remains the same, as they are not modified in the loop head.


The other variables, `lista_A`, `lista_B`, `stdin`, `pref`, and `soma_b`, are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.


State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= `n`, `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `i + 1`, `pref` and `soma_b` are unchanged**
