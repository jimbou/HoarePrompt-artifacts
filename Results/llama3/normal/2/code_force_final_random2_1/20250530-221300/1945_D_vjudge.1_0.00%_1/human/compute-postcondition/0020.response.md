Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer greater than 0, lista_A is a list of n integers in reverse order, lista_B is a list of n integers in reverse order, stdin is empty, i is equal to n - k + 1, pref is the sum of all elements in lista_A that are less than the corresponding elements in lista_B plus the sum of all elements in lista_B that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in lista_A up to the (n-k)th iteration, soma_b is soma_b + lista_B[i-1] + lista_B[i], resultado is the minimum of its original value and pref + soma_b + lista_A[i-1] + lista_A[i].**

The code updates the values of `resultado` and `soma_b`. The first line assigns the minimum value between the original `resultado` and the sum of `pref`, `soma_b`, and `lista_A[i]` to `resultado`. The second line increments `soma_b` by the value of `lista_B[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
