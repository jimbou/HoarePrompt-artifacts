Output: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer greater than 0, lista_A is a list of n integers in reverse order, lista_B is a list of n integers in reverse order, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, pref is the sum of all elements in lista_A that are less than the corresponding elements in lista_B plus the sum of all elements in lista_B that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in lista_A up to the (n-k)th iteration, soma_b is the sum of all elements in lista_B from the (n-k)th to the nth iteration, resultado is the minimum of its original value and pref + soma_b + the sum of all elements in lista_A from the (n-k)th to the nth iteration, and the value of resultado is being printed**
