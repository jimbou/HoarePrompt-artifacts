Output State: **`numero_testes` is greater than or equal to 0 and the function `func_1()` has been executed `numero_testes` times.**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of `numero_testes` will be the same as it was before the loop started, and the function `func_1()` will have been executed a number of times equal to the value of `numero_testes`. If `numero_testes` is 0, the loop will not execute at all, and `func_1()` will not be executed. If `numero_testes` is greater than 0, the loop will execute that many times, and `func_1()` will be executed that many times.
