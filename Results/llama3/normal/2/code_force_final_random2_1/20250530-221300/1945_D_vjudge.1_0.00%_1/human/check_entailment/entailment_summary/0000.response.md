Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem described, which involves finding the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first m people in line. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` reads input from stdin, processes two lists of integers, and prints the minimum sum of certain elements. It takes no arguments and returns no value, but instead prints the result to the console. The function's purpose is to find the minimum sum of elements in the lists based on certain conditions, and it achieves this by iterating through the lists, comparing elements, and updating the sum accordingly.

`func_2` reads a specified number of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines of integers, and executes `func_1` for each test case, without returning any value or modifying the input data.

The program's correctness can be determined by analyzing the execution summaries of its functions. `func_1` correctly processes the input lists and prints the minimum sum of elements based on the problem's conditions. `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases and executes `func_1` for each test case.

Therefore, based on the execution summaries, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
