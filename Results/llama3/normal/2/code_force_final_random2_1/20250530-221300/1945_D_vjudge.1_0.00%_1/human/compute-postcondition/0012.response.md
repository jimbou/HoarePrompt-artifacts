Output State: **n is greater than k, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, lista_A is a list of n integers in reverse order, lista_B is a list of n integers in reverse order, stdin is empty, i is i + 1, pref is pref + soma_b + lista_A[i], soma_b is 0**

The code block modifies the values of `pref` and `soma_b`. The first line adds the value of `soma_b` to `pref`, effectively increasing `pref` by the value of `soma_b`. The second line adds the value of `lista_A[i]` to `pref`, further increasing `pref` by the value of `lista_A[i]`. The third line resets `soma_b` to 0. The values of `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, `lista_B`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged.
