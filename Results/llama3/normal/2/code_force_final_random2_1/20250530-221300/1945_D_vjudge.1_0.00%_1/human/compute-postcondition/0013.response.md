Output State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= `n`, `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `i + 1`, `pref` is unchanged, and `soma_b` is increased by the value of the integer at index `i` in `lista_B`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, `stdin`, and `pref` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `soma_b` is increased by the value of the integer at the current index `i` in the list `lista_B`.
