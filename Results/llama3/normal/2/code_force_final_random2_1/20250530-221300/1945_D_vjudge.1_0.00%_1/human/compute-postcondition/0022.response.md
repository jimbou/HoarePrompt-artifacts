Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer greater than 0, lista_A is a list of n integers in reverse order, lista_B is a list of n integers in reverse order, stdin is empty, i is equal to n - k + 2, pref is the sum of all elements in lista_A that are less than the corresponding elements in lista_B plus the sum of all elements in lista_B that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in lista_A up to the (n-k)th iteration, soma_b is soma_b + lista_B[i-1] + lista_B[i] + lista_B[i], resultado is the minimum of its original value and pref + soma_b + lista_A[i-1] + lista_A[i] + lista_A[i].**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, `lista_B`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still equal to `n - k + 2`. The value of `pref` remains the same as it was not modified by the code. The value of `soma_b` has been incremented by `lista_B[i]`. The value of `resultado` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value and the sum of `pref`, `soma_b`, `lista_A[i-1]`, `lista_A[i]`, and `lista_A[i]`.
