Output State: **`numero_testes` is greater than 0 and the function `func_1()` has been executed three times**

The code executes the function `func_1()` once. Since the function `func_1()` has already been executed twice before, the total number of executions of `func_1()` is now three. The value of `numero_testes` remains greater than 0, as it is not affected by the execution of `func_1()`.
