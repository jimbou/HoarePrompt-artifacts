Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The problem statement requires finding the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first m people in line. The program correctly implements this by iterating through the lists of integers, comparing elements, and updating the sum accordingly.

2. The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the number of people in the queue (n) is equal to the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (m).

3. The program uses a greedy approach to find the minimum sum, which is the most efficient approach for this problem.

4. The program correctly prints the minimum sum to the console.

5. The program does not have any syntax errors or logical errors.

6. The program correctly handles the input and output formats as specified in the problem statement.

7. The program does not have any unnecessary or redundant code.

8. The program is well-structured and easy to understand.

Correctness: **True**
