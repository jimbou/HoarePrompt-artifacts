Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= `n`, `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `i + 1`. If `lista_A[i]` is less than `lista_B[i]`, then `pref` is `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` and `soma_b` is 0. Otherwise, `pref` is unchanged and `soma_b` is increased by the value of the integer at index `i` in `lista_B`.***
