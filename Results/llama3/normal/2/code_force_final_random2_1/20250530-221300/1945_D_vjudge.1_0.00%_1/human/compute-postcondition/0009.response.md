Output State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `lista_A` is a list of n integers in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of n integers in reverse order, `stdin` is empty, `i` is incremented by 1, `soma_b` is increased by the (i+1)th integer in `lista_B`**

In this output state, the value of `soma_b` has been updated by adding the (i+1)th integer in `lista_B` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `i` is incremented by 1, so it now points to the next element in `lista_B`. The list `lista_A` and `lista_B` are still in reverse order, and `n` is still greater than `k`. The stdin is still empty.
