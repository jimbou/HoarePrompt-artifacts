Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, lista_A is a list of n integers in reverse order, lista_B is a list of n integers in reverse order, stdin is empty, i is equal to n - k, pref is the sum of all elements in lista_A that are less than the corresponding elements in lista_B plus the sum of all elements in lista_B that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in lista_A up to the (n-k)th iteration, soma_b is 0, resultado is positive infinity.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - k, n):
    resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
    soma_b += lista_B[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer greater than 0, lista_A is a list of n integers in reverse order, lista_B is a list of n integers in reverse order, stdin is empty, i is equal to n - k, pref is the sum of all elements in lista_A that are less than the corresponding elements in lista_B plus the sum of all elements in lista_B that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in lista_A up to the (n-k)th iteration, soma_b is soma_b + lista_B[i], resultado is the minimum of its original value and pref + soma_b + lista_A[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer greater than 0, lista_A is a list of n integers in reverse order, lista_B is a list of n integers in reverse order, stdin is empty, i is equal to n - k + 1, pref is the sum of all elements in lista_A that are less than the corresponding elements in lista_B plus the sum of all elements in lista_B that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in lista_A up to the (n-k)th iteration, soma_b is soma_b + lista_B[i-1] + lista_B[i], resultado is the minimum of its original value and pref + soma_b + lista_A[i-1] + lista_A[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer greater than 0, lista_A is a list of n integers in reverse order, lista_B is a list of n integers in reverse order, stdin is empty, i is equal to n - k + 2, pref is the sum of all elements in lista_A that are less than the corresponding elements in lista_B plus the sum of all elements in lista_B that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in lista_A up to the (n-k)th iteration, soma_b is soma_b + lista_B[i-1] + lista_B[i] + lista_B[i], resultado is the minimum of its original value and pref + soma_b + lista_A[i-1] + lista_A[i] + lista_A[i].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
