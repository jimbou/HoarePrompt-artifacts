Postcondition: ***n is greater than k, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, lista_A is a list of n integers in reverse order, lista_B is a list of n integers in reverse order, stdin is empty, i is incremented by 1. If lista_A[i] is less than lista_B[i], then pref is incremented by soma_b and lista_A[i], and soma_b is reset to 0. Otherwise, soma_b is increased by the (i+1)th integer in lista_B.***
