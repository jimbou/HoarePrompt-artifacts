Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, lista_A is a list of n integers in reverse order, lista_B is a list of n integers in reverse order, soma_b is 0, pref is 0, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - k):
    if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:
        pref += soma_b
        pref += lista_A[i]
        soma_b = 0
    else:
        soma_b += lista_B[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is greater than k, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, lista_A is a list of n integers in reverse order, lista_B is a list of n integers in reverse order, stdin is empty. If the current value of lista_A[i] is less than the current value of lista_B[i], then pref is equal to its original value plus lista_A[i] and soma_b is 0. Otherwise, soma_b is equal to the element at index i of lista_B and pref is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is greater than k, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, lista_A is a list of n integers in reverse order, lista_B is a list of n integers in reverse order, stdin is empty, i is incremented by 1. If lista_A[i] is less than lista_B[i], then pref is incremented by soma_b and lista_A[i], and soma_b is reset to 0. Otherwise, soma_b is increased by the (i+1)th integer in lista_B.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= `n`, `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `i + 1`. If `lista_A[i]` is less than `lista_B[i]`, then `pref` is `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` and `soma_b` is 0. Otherwise, `pref` is unchanged and `soma_b` is increased by the value of the integer at index `i` in `lista_B`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
