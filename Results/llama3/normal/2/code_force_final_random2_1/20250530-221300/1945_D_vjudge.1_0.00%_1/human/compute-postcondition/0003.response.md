According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `numero_testes`. If `numero_testes` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `numero_testes` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `numero_testes` must be decreased by 1.
State: **`numero_testes` is greater than -1 and the function `func_1()` has been executed**
