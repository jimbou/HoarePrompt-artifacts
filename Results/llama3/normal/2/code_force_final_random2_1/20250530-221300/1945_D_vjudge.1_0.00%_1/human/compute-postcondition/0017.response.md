To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`, and the range defined by `n - k`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. For the loop to execute, `n - k` must be less than `n`, which implies that `k` must be greater than 0.
2. Since `i` is the loop variable, its initial value should be equal to `n - k`.
3. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Considering these points, the adjusted states are:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 0, `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `n - k`, `pref` is the sum of all elements in `lista_A` that are less than the corresponding elements in `lista_B` plus the sum of all elements in `lista_B` that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in `lista_A` up to the `(n-k)`th iteration, `soma_b` is 0, `resultado` is positive infinity**
