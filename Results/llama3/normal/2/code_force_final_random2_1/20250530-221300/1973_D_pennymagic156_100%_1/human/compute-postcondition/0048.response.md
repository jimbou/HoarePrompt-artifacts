The code prints a formatted string containing a question mark, the value of `l` which is 1, and the product of `i` which is 2 and `v` which is the value returned by `func_2()`. The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is immediately displayed.
Output: **? 1 2 * v (where v is the value returned by func_2())**
