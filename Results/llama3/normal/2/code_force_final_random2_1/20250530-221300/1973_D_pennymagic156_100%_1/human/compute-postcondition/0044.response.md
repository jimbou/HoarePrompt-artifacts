To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head: `cnt and l < n + 1`.

1. `cnt`: Since `cnt` is already equal to `k`, and `k` is a positive integer, `cnt` is already in a state that allows the loop to execute. No adjustment is needed here.

2. `l < n + 1`: Given that `l` is equal to 1 and `n` is a positive integer such that `n // k` is at least 2, we know `n` is at least 2. Therefore, `n + 1` will always be greater than 1, making `l < n + 1` true without needing any adjustments.

Since both conditions are already satisfied with the given states, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`v` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4 and n // k is at least 2, `i` is 2, `cnt` is equal to `k`, and `l` is equal to 1.**
