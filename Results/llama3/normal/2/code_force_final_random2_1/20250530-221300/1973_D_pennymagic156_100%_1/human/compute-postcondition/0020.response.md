Output State: **v is returned with the value of func_2(), n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, i is equal to 1, and this is printed: "? 1 [i * n]" where i is 1, and v is now returned with the value of func_2(). If v is equal to n, then v is equal to i, which is 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the value of `v` is the return value of `func_2()`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and `i` is now equal to 1. The loop has printed the string "? 1 [i * n]" where `i` is 1, and the value of `v` is now equal to the return value of `func_2()`. If the return value of `func_2()` is equal to `n`, then `v` is equal to 1.
