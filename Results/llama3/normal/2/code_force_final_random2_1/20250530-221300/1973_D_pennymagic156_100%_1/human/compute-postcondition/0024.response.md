Based on the initial state, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `l` is 1, so it will be printed as is.
* `i` is 1, so it will be multiplied by `v` and printed.
* `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`, which is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, since `v` is used in the print statement, we can assume it has a value.

Therefore, the print statement will output a string in the format `? 1 <i * v>`, where `<i * v>` is the result of multiplying `i` (which is 1) by the value of `v`.

Output: **? 1 <v> (where v is the value returned by func_2())**
