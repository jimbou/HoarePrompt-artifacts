Output State: **`v` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4 and n // k is at least 2, `i` is 2, `cnt` is equal to `k`, and `l` is equal to 1.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `i`, and `v` remain unchanged. The value of `cnt` is updated to be equal to `k`, and the value of `l` is updated to be equal to 1. The condition that `n // k` is at least 2 is still valid, and `l` is still less than or equal to `n`.
