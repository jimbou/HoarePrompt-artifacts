The code prints a formatted string containing a question mark, the value of `l` which is 1, and the product of `i` and `v` where `i` is the current value of `i` and `v` is the current value of `v`. The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is displayed immediately.

Output: **? 1 (i * v) (where i is the current value of i and v is the current value of v)**
