Postcondition: ***v is the value returned by func_2(), n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4 and n // k is at least 1, i is 1, cnt is equal to 0, and l is equal to the value returned by func_2() + 1 and l is less than or equal to n. Either cnt is not equal to 0 or l is not equal to n + 1.***
