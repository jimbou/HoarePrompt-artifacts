Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `l` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than `k * (i + 1)`, and the string "? 1 (2 * v)" is printed `k` times, and this is printed: "? 1 (i * v)" where i is the current value of i and v is the current value of v, repeated `k` times.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the counter `cnt` has reached 0, the variable `l` has reached `n + 1`, and the string "? 1 (2 * v)" has been printed `k` times. Additionally, the string "? 1 (i * v)" has been printed `k` times, where `i` and `v` are the current values of `i` and `v`, respectively. The value of `n` remains greater than `k * (i + 1)`.
