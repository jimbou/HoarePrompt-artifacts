According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and `k`. If `n // k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, and `v` is returned with the value of `func_2()`. For the loop to be executed, `n // k` must be at least 1, and `i` is now 1. 

State: **`v` is returned with the value of `func_2()`, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4 and `n // k` is at least 1, `i` is 1**
