To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n // k + 1):`. The variables involved are `i`, `n`, and `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `n + 1`, and the string "? 1 (2 * v)" is printed `k` times.

To adjust the states for the next iteration, we need to consider the condition `i in range(1, n // k + 1)`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n // k + 1`.

Since `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the given state, we can't directly adjust its value. However, we can infer that `i` must be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

The only variable we can adjust is `n`, which is involved in the loop condition. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `k * i`.

State: **`cnt` is 0, `l` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than `k * (i + 1)`, and the string "? 1 (2 * v)" is printed `k` times.**

Note that we can't adjust the state of `k` as it's not involved in the loop condition.
