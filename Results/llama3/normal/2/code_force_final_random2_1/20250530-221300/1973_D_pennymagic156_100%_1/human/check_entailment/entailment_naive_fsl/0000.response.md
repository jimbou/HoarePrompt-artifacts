Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. Specifically, it does not handle the case when the maximum value of the array is not in the first position. In this case, the program will not be able to find the correct value of `v` and will print an incorrect answer.

For example, if the input is `n = 5, k = 2` and the hidden array is `[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the program will print `? 1 5` and get `v = 5`, but then it will not be able to find the correct value of `i` and will print an incorrect answer.

The program assumes that the maximum value of the array is always in the first position, which is not necessarily true. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
