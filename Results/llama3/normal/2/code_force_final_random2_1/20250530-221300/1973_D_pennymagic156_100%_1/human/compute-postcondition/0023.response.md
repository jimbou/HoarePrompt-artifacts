To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head: `cnt and l < n + 1`.

1. **`cnt`**: The loop requires `cnt` to be truthy (i.e., not zero or False). Since `cnt` is initially equal to `k`, and `k` is a positive integer, `cnt` is already guaranteed to be truthy. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `cnt`.

2. **`l < n + 1`**: For this condition to be true, `l` must be less than `n + 1`. Given that `l` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer such that `n <= 10^4`, `l` is already less than `n + 1`. Thus, no adjustment is necessary for `l` or `n` based on this condition alone.

However, considering the constraints provided:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers.
- `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4`.
- `n // k` is at least 1.

These constraints already ensure that `n` is at least 1 (since `k` is at least 1 and `n // k` is at least 1), which means `n + 1` will always be greater than 1. Therefore, with `l` being 1, the condition `l < n + 1` is inherently satisfied without needing any further adjustments.

Given the analysis, the state right before the loop does not require any adjustments for the loop to execute the first time, as all conditions are already met based on the provided initial states and constraints.

State: **`v` is returned with the value of `func_2()`, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4 and `n // k` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `cnt` is equal to `k`, and `l` is 1.**
