Output State: **v is equal to i, which is either v-1 or n-1 depending on whether v is equal to n or not, n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4**

In this output state, the value of `v` has been updated to be equal to `i`, which is either `v-1` or `n-1` depending on whether `v` is equal to `n` or not. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables.
