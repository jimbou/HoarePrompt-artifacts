Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: v is returned with the value of func_2(), n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, i is equal to 1, and this is printed: "? 1 [i * n]" where i is 1, and v is now returned with the value of func_2(). If v is equal to n, then v is equal to i, which is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n // k + 1):
    cnt, l = k, 1
    while cnt and l < n + 1:
        print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
        l = func_2() + 1
        cnt -= 1
    if cnt == 0 and l == n + 1:
        print(f'! {i * v}', flush=True)
        func_2()
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *v is the value returned by func_2(), n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4 and n // k is at least 1, i is 1, cnt is equal to 0, and l is equal to the value returned by func_2() + 1 and l is less than or equal to n. Either cnt is not equal to 0 or l is not equal to n + 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: cnt is 0, l is n + 1, and the string "? 1 (2 * v)" is printed k times.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cnt` is 0, `l` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than `k * (i + 1)`, and the string "? 1 (2 * v)" is printed `k` times, and this is printed: "? 1 (i * v)" where i is the current value of i and v is the current value of v, repeated `k` times.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
