According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `cnt` and `l`. If `cnt` is greater than 0 and `l` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` is equal to `k - 2` and `cnt` is greater than 0, `l` is equal to the value returned by `func_2()` + 1 and `l` is less than `n + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must be greater than 0 and `l` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `cnt` is already greater than 0, we only need to adjust `l` to be less than `n + 1`. We can do this by adjusting `n` to be greater than `l - 1`. 

State: **`v` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that `1 <= k <= n` and `n >= 2` and `n // k` is at least 1 and `n` is greater than `l - 1`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is equal to `k - 2` and `cnt` is greater than 0, and `l` is equal to the value returned by `func_2()` + 1 and `l` is less than `n + 1`, and this is printed: "? [l] [i * v]" where `l` is the value returned by `func_2()` + 1 and `i * v` is the product of 1 and the value returned by `func_2()`**
