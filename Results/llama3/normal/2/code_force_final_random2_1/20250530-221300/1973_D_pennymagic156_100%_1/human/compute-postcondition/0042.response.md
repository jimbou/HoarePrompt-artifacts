To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved. The loop head is `for i in range(1, n // k + 1):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`
* `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4 and n // k is at least 1
* `i` is 1
* `cnt` is equal to 0
* `l` is equal to the value returned by `func_2()` + 1 and `l` is less than or equal to `n`
* Either `cnt` is not equal to 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`

Since the loop head only involves `i`, `n`, and `k`, we can only adjust the states of these variables.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

The condition `n // k` is at least 1 is still satisfied, as `n` and `k` are not changed.

The state of `v`, `cnt`, and `l` remains unchanged, as they are not involved in the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`v` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4 and n // k is at least 2, `i` is 2, `cnt` is equal to 0, and `l` is equal to the value returned by `func_2()` + 1 and `l` is less than or equal to `n`**
