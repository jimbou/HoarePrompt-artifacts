Output: **`v` is returned with the value of `func_2()`, n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, i is equal to `v-1` if `v` is not equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is equal to `n-1`, and this is printed: "? 1 [i * n]" where i is either v-1 or n-1 depending on whether v is equal to n or not**
