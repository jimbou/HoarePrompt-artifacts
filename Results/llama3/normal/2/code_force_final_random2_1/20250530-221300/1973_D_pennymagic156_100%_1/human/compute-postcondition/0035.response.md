Output State: **v is the value returned by func_2(), n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4 and n // k is at least 1, i is 1, cnt is equal to 0, and l is equal to the value returned by func_2() + 1 and l is less than or equal to n.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `cnt` is now 0 and the value of `l` is equal to the value returned by `func_2()` + 1 and is less than or equal to `n`. This is because the loop continues to execute until `cnt` is 0, and in each iteration, `l` is updated to be the value returned by `func_2()` + 1.
