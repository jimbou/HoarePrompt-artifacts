The code prints a formatted string that includes the value of `i` multiplied by the value returned by `func_2()`, which is denoted as `v`. The value of `i` is 1, and the value of `v` is equal to `n + 1 - 1`, which simplifies to `n`. The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is immediately displayed.

Output: **! 1 * n (where n is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4)**
