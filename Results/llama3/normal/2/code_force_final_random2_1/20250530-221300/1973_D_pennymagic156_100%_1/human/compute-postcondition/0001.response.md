According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4 and `v` is 1, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is now `n`. 

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `v` is 1, `i` is `n`**
