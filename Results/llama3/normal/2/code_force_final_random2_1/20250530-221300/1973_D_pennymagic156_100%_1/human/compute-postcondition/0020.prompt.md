Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, v is 1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)
    v = func_2()
    if v == n:
        v = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, if the return value of func_2() is equal to n, then n, k, and i are equal to n. Otherwise, no changes are made to n, k, and i.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`v` is returned with the value of `func_2()`, n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4. If the return value of `func_2()` is equal to n, then n, k, and i are equal to n-1. Otherwise, no changes are made to n, k, and i. Additionally, v is equal to i.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *v is returned with the value of func_2(), n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, i is equal to v-1 if v is not equal to n, otherwise i is equal to n-1, and this is printed: "? 1 [i * n]" where i is either v-1 or n-1 depending on whether v is equal to n or not, and v is now returned with the value of func_2(). If v is equal to n, then v is equal to i, which is either v-1 or n-1 depending on whether v is equal to n or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
