Output: **`v` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4 and n // k is at least 2 and n is at least 2 * k and n is greater than 0 and k is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `cnt` is equal to `k` and cnt is greater than 0, and `l` is equal to 1 and l is less than n + 1, ensuring n is greater than 1, and this is printed: "? 1 (2 * v)" where v is the value returned by func_2()**
