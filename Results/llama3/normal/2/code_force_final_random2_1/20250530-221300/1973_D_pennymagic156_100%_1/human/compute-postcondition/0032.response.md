The code prints a formatted string containing three values: a question mark, the value of `l`, and the product of `i` and `v`. 

The value of `l` is the value returned by `func_2()` + 1. Since the exact value returned by `func_2()` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `l`. However, based on the structure of the problem, `l` is at least 2 and less than `n + 1`.

The value of `i * v` is the product of 1 and the value returned by `func_2()`. Since the exact value returned by `func_2()` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `i * v`. However, based on the structure of the problem, `i * v` is equal to the value returned by `func_2()`.

Output: **? [l] [v] (where l is at least 2 and less than n + 1, and v is the value returned by func_2())**
