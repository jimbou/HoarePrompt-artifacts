Output State: **cnt is 0, l is n + 1, and the string "? 1 (i * v)" is printed k times, where i is the current value of i and v is the current value of v, repeated for each iteration of the loop, and the loop has iterated n // k times.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has completed all its iterations, and the final state is characterized by the following:

*   The counter `cnt` is 0, indicating that the inner while loop has finished its execution.
*   The variable `l` is `n + 1`, which is the expected value after the inner while loop completes.
*   The string "? 1 (i \* v)" is printed `k` times for each iteration of the outer for loop, where `i` is the current value of `i` and `v` is the current value of `v`. This indicates that the loop has iterated `n // k` times, printing the specified string for each iteration.
*   The loop has iterated `n // k` times, which is the expected number of iterations based on the loop condition.
