Output State: **v is the value returned by func_2(), n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4 and n // k is at least 1, i is 1, cnt is equal to k - 1, and l is equal to the value returned by func_2() + 1, and this is printed: "? 1 1 * v" where v is the value returned by func_2()**

In this output state, the value of `v` remains unchanged as it is the value returned by `func_2()`. The values of `n` and `k` also remain unchanged as they are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4 and `n // k` is at least 1. The value of `i` remains 1. The value of `cnt` is decremented by 1, making it equal to `k - 1`. The value of `l` is updated to be equal to the value returned by `func_2() + 1`. The print statement remains the same, printing "? 1 1 * v" where `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`.
