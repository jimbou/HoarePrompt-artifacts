According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `cnt` and `l`. If `cnt` is not zero and `l` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` is equal to `k - 1` and `l` is equal to the value returned by `func_2() + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must be greater than 0 and `l` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `cnt` is equal to `k - 1` and `k` is a positive integer, `cnt` is at least 0. However, since `l` is equal to the value returned by `func_2() + 1` and `n // k` is at least 1, `l` is at least 2. Therefore, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **v is the value returned by func_2(), n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n and n >= 2 and n // k is at least 1, i is 1, cnt is equal to k - 1 and cnt is greater than 0, and l is equal to the value returned by func_2() + 1 and l is less than n + 1, and this is printed: "? 1 1 * v" where v is the value returned by func_2()**
