The code prints a formatted string containing a question mark, the number 1, and the product of `i` and `n`. Here, `i` is either `v-1` or `n-1` depending on whether `v` is equal to `n` or not, and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is immediately displayed on the screen.

Output: **? 1 [i * n] (where i is either v-1 or n-1, and n is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4)**
