Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into exactly `k` subarrays, each with the product of its length and maximum equal to `m`. The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value `m`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of subarrays `k`.
3. It then initializes a variable `v` to 1, which will be used to store the maximum value `m`.
4. The program then enters a loop that iterates from `n` to 1. In each iteration, it prints a query `? 1 i * n` and reads the response `v`. If `v` is equal to `n`, it means that the maximum value `m` is `i`, and the loop breaks.
5. After finding the maximum value `m`, the program enters another loop that iterates from 1 to `n // k + 1`. In each iteration, it prints a query `? l i * v` and reads the response `l`. If `l` is equal to `n + 1`, it means that the array can be split into exactly `k` subarrays with the product of its length and maximum equal to `i * v`. The program then prints the answer `! i * v` and reads the response.
6. If the program cannot find a valid `m` after iterating over all possible values, it prints the answer `! -1` and reads the response.

The program's logic is correct, and it should be able to find the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into exactly `k` subarrays with the product of its length and maximum equal to `m`.

Correctness: **True**
