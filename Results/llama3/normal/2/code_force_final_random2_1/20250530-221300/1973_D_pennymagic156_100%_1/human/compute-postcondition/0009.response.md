Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `i * n`: Since `i` is not explicitly defined in the precondition, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4.
* `flush=True`: This is a parameter that forces the output to be printed immediately, without buffering.

Considering the precondition, we can conclude that the print statement will output a string in the format '? 1 <value>', where `<value>` is the result of the multiplication `i * n`.

Since `i` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `i * n`. However, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **? 1 [i * n] (where i is an undefined value and n is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4)**
