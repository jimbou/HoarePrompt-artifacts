Output State: **`v` is returned with the value of `func_2()`, n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, i is equal to `v-1` if `v` is not equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is equal to `n-1`, and this is printed: "? 1 [i * n]" where i is either v-1 or n-1 depending on whether v is equal to n or not, and `v` is now returned with the value of `func_2()`**

In this output state, the value of `v` is updated to be the return value of `func_2()`, while the values of `n`, `k`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The print statement is also executed, displaying the value of `i` multiplied by `n`.
