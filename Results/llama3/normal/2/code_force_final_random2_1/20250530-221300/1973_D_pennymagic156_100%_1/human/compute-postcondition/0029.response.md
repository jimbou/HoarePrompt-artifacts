Output: **v is the value returned by func_2(), n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n and n >= 2 and n // k is at least 1, i is 1, cnt is equal to k - 1 and cnt is greater than 0, and l is equal to the value returned by func_2() + 1 and l is less than n + 1, and this is printed: "? [l] [i * v]" where l is the value returned by func_2() + 1 and i * v is the product of 1 and the value returned by func_2()**
