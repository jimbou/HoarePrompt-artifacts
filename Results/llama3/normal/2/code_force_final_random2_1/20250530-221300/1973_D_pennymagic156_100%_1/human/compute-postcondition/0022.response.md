Output State: **`v` is returned with the value of `func_2()`, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4 and `n // k` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `cnt` is equal to `k`, and `l` is 1.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The value of `v` is still returned with the value of `func_2()`. The new variables `cnt` and `l` are introduced, where `cnt` is assigned the value of `k` and `l` is assigned the value 1.
