Output State: **`v` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `k` <= `n` <= 10^4 and `n` // `k` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 0, `l` is equal to `n` + 1 which is also equal to the value returned by `func_2()` + 1, and the value returned by `func_2()` is returned.**

In this output state, the value of `v` is updated to be the value returned by `func_2()`, and the value returned by `func_2()` is returned. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `n` // `k` is at least 1 is still valid. The value of `l` is still equal to `n` + 1, which is also equal to the value returned by `func_2()` + 1.
