Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `v` is the return value of `func_2()`, `i` is `n`, and this is printed: "? 1 [i * n]" where i is equal to n and n is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of `v` is updated to the return value of the function `func_2()`, which is unknown. The value of `i` remains `n` as it is not changed by the code. The print statement is still executed with the same values of `i` and `n`.
