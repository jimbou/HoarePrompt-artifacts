The code prints a formatted string that includes the value of `l`, the product of `i` and `v`, and a newline character (due to the `flush=True` argument). 

Since the exact values of `i` and `v` are not provided in the precondition, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `i * v`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the product of `i` and `v`.

Output: **? 1 (i * v) (where i * v is the product of i and v)**
