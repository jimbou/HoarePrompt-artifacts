Output State: **cnt is 0, l is n + 1, the string "? 1 (i * v)" is printed k times, where i is the current value of i and v is the current value of v, repeated for each iteration of the loop, and the loop has iterated n // k times, '! -1' is printed, and func_2() has been executed.**

In this output state, the values of cnt and l remain unchanged, as the code snippet does not modify them. The string "? 1 (i * v)" is still printed k times for each iteration of the loop, and the loop has still iterated n // k times. Additionally, '! -1' is still printed. The only change is that the function func_2() has been executed, but its effects are not specified in the initial state, so we can only acknowledge that it has been executed without knowing its specific impact on the program state.
