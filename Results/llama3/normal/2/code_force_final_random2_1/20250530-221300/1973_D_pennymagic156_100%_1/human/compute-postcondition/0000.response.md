Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, v is 1**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line calls the function `func_3()` and assigns its return values to `n` and `k`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, and the function call does not modify these constraints, `n` and `k` remain positive integers within the same range after the function call.

The second line assigns the value 1 to `v`. This line does not affect the values of `n` and `k`.

The third line is empty and does not affect any variables.

Therefore, after executing the entire code block, `n` and `k` remain positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, and `v` is assigned the value 1.
