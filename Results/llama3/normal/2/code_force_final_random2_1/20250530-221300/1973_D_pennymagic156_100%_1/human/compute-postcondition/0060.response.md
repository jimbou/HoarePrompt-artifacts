According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `cnt` and `l`. If `cnt` is not zero and `l` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` is `k` and `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 1, `n` is greater than `k * (i + 1)`. `cnt` is not zero and `l` is less than `n + 1`, so the loop can execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`cnt` is `k` and `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 1, `n` is greater than `k * (i + 1)`, and the string "? 1 (2 * v)" is printed `k` times, and this is printed: "? 1 (i * v)" where i is the current value of i and v is the current value of v**
