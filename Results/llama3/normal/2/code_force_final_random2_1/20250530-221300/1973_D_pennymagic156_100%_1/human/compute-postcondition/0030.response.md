Output State: **v is the value returned by func_2(), n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n and n >= 2 and n // k is at least 1, i is 1, cnt is equal to k - 2 and cnt is greater than 0, and l is equal to the value returned by func_2() + 1 and l is less than n + 1, and this is printed: "? [l] [i * v]" where l is the value returned by func_2() + 1 and i * v is the product of 1 and the value returned by func_2()**

The code executes two lines. The first line assigns the value returned by `func_2()` plus 1 to `l`. Since `l` was already equal to the value returned by `func_2()` plus 1, this line does not change the value of `l`. The second line decrements `cnt` by 1. Since `cnt` was equal to `k - 1` and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n and n >= 2 and n // k is at least 1, `cnt` becomes `k - 2`. The value of `cnt` is still greater than 0 because `k` is at least 1 and `n` is at least 2. The values of `v`, `n`, `k`, `i` are not affected by the code.
