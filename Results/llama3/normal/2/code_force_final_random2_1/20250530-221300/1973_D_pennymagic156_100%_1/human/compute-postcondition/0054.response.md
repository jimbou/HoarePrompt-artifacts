Output State: **cnt is 0, l is n + 1, and the string "? 1 (2 * v)" is printed k times.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the counter `cnt` has reached 0, the variable `l` has reached `n + 1`, and the string "? 1 (2 * v)" has been printed `k` times, where `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`.
