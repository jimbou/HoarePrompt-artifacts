Output State: `cnt` is 0 and `l` is equal to `n + 1`, and this is printed: "? 1 (2 * v)" where v is the value returned by func_2()

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the counter `cnt` has reached 0, and the variable `l` has reached the value of `n + 1`. The loop has printed the string "? 1 (2 * v)" where v is the value returned by the function `func_2()`.
