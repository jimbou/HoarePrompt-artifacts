Based on the precondition, let's break down the values of the variables and objects that are printed:

* `l` is equal to the value returned by `func_2()` + 1, and it is less than `n` + 1. Since `n` is a positive integer and `n` // `k` is at least 1, we know that `n` is at least 2. Therefore, `l` is at least 2 + 1 = 3.
* `i` is equal to 1.
* `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`. Since the exact value of `v` is not provided, we can't determine its exact numerical value. However, we know that it is the value returned by the function `func_2()`.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)`

The print statement will output a formatted string with three values:

* `?` is a literal character.
* `l` is the value of `l`, which is at least 3.
* `i * v` is the product of `i` (which is 1) and `v` (which is the value returned by `func_2()`).

Therefore, the output will be a string in the format `? x y`, where `x` is at least 3 and `y` is the value returned by `func_2()`.

Output: **? [at least 3] [value returned by func_2()]**
