According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `cnt` and `l`. If `cnt` is not zero and `l` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` is equal to `k`, `l` is equal to 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4 and n // k is at least 2. For the loop to be executed one more time, `cnt` must be greater than 0 and `l` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `cnt` is equal to `k`, `k` must be greater than 0. Since `l` is equal to 1, `n` must be greater than 0. Since `n` is greater than 1, `n` must be at least 2. Since `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4 and n // k is at least 2, `k` must be less than or equal to `n` and `n` must be at least 2 * `k`. So `n` must be at least 2 * `k` and `k` must be greater than 0. Also, `n` must be greater than 0.
State: **`v` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4 and n // k is at least 2 and n is at least 2 * k and n is greater than 0 and k is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `cnt` is equal to `k` and cnt is greater than 0, and `l` is equal to 1 and l is less than n + 1, ensuring n is greater than 1, and this is printed: "? 1 (2 * v)" where v is the value returned by func_2()**
