The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `v` and `n` is equal to `n-1` if `v` is equal to `n`. Otherwise, `n` is not changed. So for the loop to execute again `i` must be equal to `v-1` and `n` must be equal to `n-1` if `v` is equal to `n`. Otherwise, `n` is not changed.
State: **`v` is returned with the value of `func_2()`, n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, i is equal to `v-1` if `v` is not equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is equal to `n-1`**
