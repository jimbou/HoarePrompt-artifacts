The only variable in the loop head is variable i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i. If i is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is equal to n. For the loop to execute again, i must be equal to n-1.
State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, if the return value of func_2() is equal to n, then n, k, and i are equal to n-1. Otherwise, no changes are made to n, k, and i.**
