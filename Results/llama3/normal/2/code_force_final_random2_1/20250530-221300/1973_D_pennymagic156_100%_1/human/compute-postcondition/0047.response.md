To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop statement: `cnt` must be non-zero (`cnt and`) and `l` must be less than `n + 1` (`l < n + 1`).

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4 and n // k is at least 2
- `i` is 2
- `cnt` is equal to `k`
- `l` is equal to 1

And the condition for the loop to execute again is that `cnt` must be non-zero and `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

Since `cnt` is equal to `k` and `k` is a positive integer, `cnt` is already non-zero, so no adjustment is needed for `cnt`.

For `l` to be less than `n + 1`, given that `l` is currently 1, `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure `l` is less than `n + 1` after the next iteration. However, since `n` is already defined as a positive integer greater than or equal to `k` and `n // k` is at least 2, `n` is already greater than 1. Thus, no adjustment is explicitly needed for `n` based on the given conditions, but we must ensure that `n` remains greater than 1 to satisfy the loop condition for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted or ensured for the loop to execute one more time is primarily about maintaining the conditions that allow `cnt` to be non-zero and `l` to be less than `n + 1`. Given the constraints, `n` should be such that it allows `l` to be less than `n + 1` in the next iteration, but since `l` is only at 1, and `n` is already constrained to be at least 2 (due to `n // k` being at least 2), the conditions are already met without needing to explicitly adjust `n` or `k` further.

State: **`v` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4 and n // k is at least 2, `i` is 2, `cnt` is equal to `k`, and `l` is equal to 1, ensuring `n` is greater than 1.**
