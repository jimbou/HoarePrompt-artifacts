Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program checks if each row contains exactly one '1' or more than one '1', and prints 'TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE' accordingly. However, this approach is not sufficient to determine the shape type.

For example, a triangle can have more than one '1' in a row, and a square can have exactly one '1' in a row. The program does not consider the position of the '1's in the grid, which is crucial in determining the shape type.

Moreover, the program prints an empty string if no '1's are found in any row, which is not a valid output according to the problem description.

To correctly determine the shape type, the program should check the pattern of '1's in the grid, considering both the count and position of '1's in each row.

Correctness: **False**
