The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains `t-1` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10) followed by `n` lines, each containing `n` characters that are either '0' or '1'. So for the loop to be executed `t` must be at least 1 and `i` is 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10) followed by `n` lines, each containing `n` characters that are either '0' or '1'.**
