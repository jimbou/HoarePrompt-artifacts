Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is 0, `a` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `s` is a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1', stdin contains `t-3-n-1` test cases. The string `s` contains more than one '1' and the current value of `s` has more than one '1'**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `b` has been updated to 'SQUARE'. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `t`, `n`, `s`, and stdin are still valid.
