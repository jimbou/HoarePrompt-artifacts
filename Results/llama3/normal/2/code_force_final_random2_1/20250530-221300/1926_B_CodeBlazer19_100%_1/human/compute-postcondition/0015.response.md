Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is a string of n characters that are either '0' or '1', `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', stdin contains t-4 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1'.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to 'SQUARE', regardless of the number of '1' characters in the string `s`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains t-4 test cases, each with an integer n and n lines of n characters that are either '0' or '1'.
