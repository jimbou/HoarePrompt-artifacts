Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is 0, `a` is 'TRIANGLE', `b` is an empty string, `s` is a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1' and contains exactly one '1', stdin contains `t-3-n-1` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 'TRIANGLE', while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains `t-3-n-1` test cases.
