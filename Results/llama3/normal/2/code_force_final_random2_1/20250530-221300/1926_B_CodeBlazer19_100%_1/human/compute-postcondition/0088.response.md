The code prints the value of variable `a`. The value of `a` is determined based on the condition that if any of the strings `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE'. Since the current value of `a` is not 0, it means that at least one string `s` contains exactly one '1'. Therefore, the value of `a` is 'TRIANGLE'.

Output: **TRIANGLE**
