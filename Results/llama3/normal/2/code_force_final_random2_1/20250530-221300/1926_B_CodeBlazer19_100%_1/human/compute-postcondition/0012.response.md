The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1'. If the string `s` contains exactly one '1' character, then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'.**
