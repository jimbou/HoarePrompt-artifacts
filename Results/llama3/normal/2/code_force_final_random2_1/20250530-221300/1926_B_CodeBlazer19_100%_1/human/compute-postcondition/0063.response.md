The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is `n`, `s` is a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1', stdin contains `t-2-n` test cases. If `a` is not 0, the value of `a` is printed. If `a` is 0, 'SQUARE' is printed.**
