Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is `n`, `s` is a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1', stdin contains `t-1-n` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10) followed by `n` lines, each containing `n` characters that are either '0' or '1'. If the string `s` contains exactly one '1' character, then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'.**

This output state represents the final state after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop variable `j` has reached the value of `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The string `s` still contains `n` characters that are either '0' or '1', as it was in the previous iterations. The remaining test cases in the input stream have been reduced by `n` due to the loop's execution. The values of `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop's execution. The values of `a` and `b` depend on the contents of the string `s`, which can be either 'TRIANGLE' and an empty string or 0 and 'SQUARE', respectively.
