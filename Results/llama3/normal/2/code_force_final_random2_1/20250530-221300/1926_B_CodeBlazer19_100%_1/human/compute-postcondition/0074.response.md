The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if the string `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE' if the string `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise `b` is an empty string, `s` is a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1', stdin contains `t-3-n-1` test cases.**
