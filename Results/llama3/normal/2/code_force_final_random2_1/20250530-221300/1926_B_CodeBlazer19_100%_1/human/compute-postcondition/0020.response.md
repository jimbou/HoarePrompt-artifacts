Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, `s` is a string of n characters that are either '0' or '1', `a` is 'TRIANGLE', `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE', stdin contains t-5 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (3 <= n <= 10) followed by n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1'.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 'TRIANGLE'. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-5 test cases. The value of `b` is still dependent on the number of '1' characters in the string `s`, but since `a` is now 'TRIANGLE', `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE'.
