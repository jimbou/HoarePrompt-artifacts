Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is 0, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string, `s` is a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1', stdin contains `t-3-n-1` test cases.**

The code reads a string of `n` characters from the input and assigns it to `s`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Since one test case has been read, the number of remaining test cases in stdin is reduced by 1.
