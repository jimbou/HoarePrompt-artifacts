Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is 0, `s` is a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1', `stdin` contains `t-2-n-1` test cases, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is still 1, `n` is still an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is still 0, `s` is now a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1' which is the input from the user, `stdin` now contains `t-2-n-1` test cases because one test case has been read, `a` is still 0, `b` is still an empty string.
