The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` becomes an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than or equal to 0. The second line assigns 0 to `a`. The third line assigns an empty string to `b`. The value of `t` is not affected by the code. The value of `i` is not affected by the code. The value of `j` is not affected by the code. The value of `s` is not affected by the code. Stdin contains `t-2-n-1` test cases.

Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, i is 2, n is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than or equal to 0, j is n, s is a string of n characters that are either '0' or '1', a is 0, b is an empty string, stdin contains t-2-n-1 test cases.**
