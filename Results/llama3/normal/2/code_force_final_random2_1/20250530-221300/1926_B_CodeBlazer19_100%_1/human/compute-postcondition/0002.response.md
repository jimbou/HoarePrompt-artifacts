Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, i is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive, a is 0, b is an empty string, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1'.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains 0 as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is now an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive, as it is assigned the value of the first integer input from stdin. The value of `a` is 0, as it is initialized to 0 in the code. The value of `b` is an empty string, as it is initialized to an empty string in the code. The stdin now contains `t-2` test cases, as one test case has been read and processed by the code. Each test case still contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10) followed by `n` lines, each containing `n` characters that are either '0' or '1'.
