Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1', stdin contains `t-4-n-1` test cases. If the string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'.**
