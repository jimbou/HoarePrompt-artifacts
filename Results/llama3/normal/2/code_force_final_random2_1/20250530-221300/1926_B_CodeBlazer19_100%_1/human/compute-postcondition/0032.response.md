State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is `n`, `s` is a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1', stdin contains `t-1-n` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10) followed by `n` lines, each containing `n` characters that are either '0' or '1'. If the string `s` contains exactly one '1' character, then 'TRIANGLE' is printed. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then 'SQUARE' is printed.**
