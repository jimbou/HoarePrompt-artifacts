Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, `a` is 'TRIANGLE', `b` is 'SQUARE' if the string `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise `b` is an empty string, `s` is a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1', stdin contains `t-4-n-1` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 'TRIANGLE', regardless of the contents of the string `s`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
