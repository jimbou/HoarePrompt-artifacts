Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 3 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, `s` is a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1' and is the first test case, `a` is 'TRIANGLE', `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE', stdin contains `t-5-n-1` test cases. If the string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then `b` is 'SQUARE'.**

In this output state, the value of `a` is now 'TRIANGLE', and the value of `b` depends on the number of '1's in the string `s`. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `b` is 'SQUARE'. The values of the other variables remain the same.
