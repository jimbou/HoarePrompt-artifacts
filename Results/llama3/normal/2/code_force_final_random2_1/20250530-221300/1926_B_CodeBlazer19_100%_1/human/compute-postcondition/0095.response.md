Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints a shape type ('TRIANGLE', 'SQUARE', or an empty string) based on the presence of '1's in the input strings. It iterates over a specified number of test cases, each containing a square matrix of characters, and determines the shape type by checking the count of '1's in each row. If a row contains exactly one '1', it prints 'TRIANGLE'. If a row contains more than one '1', it prints 'SQUARE'. If no '1's are found in any row, it prints an empty string.**
