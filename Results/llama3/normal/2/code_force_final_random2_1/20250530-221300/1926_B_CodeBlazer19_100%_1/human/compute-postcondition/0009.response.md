Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than 0, `a` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `s` is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1'. The string `s` contains more than one '1'. The current value of `s` has more than one '1'.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to 'SQUARE', while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains t-3 test cases, each with an integer n and n lines of n characters that are either '0' or '1'. The string `s` still contains more than one '1'.
