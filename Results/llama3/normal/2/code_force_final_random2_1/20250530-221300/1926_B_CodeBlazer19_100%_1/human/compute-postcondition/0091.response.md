Based on the initial state, the value of `b` is determined by the condition: if any of the strings `s` contains more than one '1', then `b` is 'SQUARE', otherwise `b` is an empty string.

Since `s` is a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1', and `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive, we can't determine the exact value of `b` without knowing the specific value of `s`.

However, we can describe the possible values of `b` based on the condition. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `b` will be 'SQUARE'. Otherwise, `b` will be an empty string.

Output: **'SQUARE' if s contains more than one '1', otherwise an empty string**
