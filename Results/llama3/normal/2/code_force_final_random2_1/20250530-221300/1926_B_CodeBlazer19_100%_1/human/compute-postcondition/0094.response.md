Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, i is t-1, n is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than or equal to 0, j is n, s is a string of n characters that are either '0' or '1', stdin contains 0 test cases. If any of the strings s contains exactly one '1', then 'TRIANGLE' is printed. Otherwise, if any of the strings s contains more than one '1', then 'SQUARE' is printed, otherwise an empty string is printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `t-1`, indicating that the loop has run `t` times. The variable `n` will still be an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive, and `j` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the inner loop has completed its execution. The variable `s` will still be a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1'. The stdin will be empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The output will be either 'TRIANGLE' if any of the strings `s` contains exactly one '1', 'SQUARE' if any of the strings `s` contains more than one '1', or an empty string otherwise.
