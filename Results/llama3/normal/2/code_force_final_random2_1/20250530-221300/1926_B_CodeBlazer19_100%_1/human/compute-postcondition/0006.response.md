Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than 0, `a` is 'TRIANGLE', `b` is an empty string, `s` is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1'. The current value of `s` has exactly one '1' character.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 'TRIANGLE', while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains t-3 test cases, each with an integer n followed by n lines of n characters that are either '0' or '1', and the current value of `s` still has exactly one '1' character.
