The value of `t` is assigned the integer from the input, where `input()` accepts an integer and `int` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) first and that integer is assigned into t. So stdin now contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1'. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: t is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1'.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1'.**
