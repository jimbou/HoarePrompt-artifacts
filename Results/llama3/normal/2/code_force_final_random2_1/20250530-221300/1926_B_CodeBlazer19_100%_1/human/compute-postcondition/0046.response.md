Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1' and is the first test case, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', stdin contains `t-2-n-2` test cases. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE'. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to 'SQUARE', regardless of the number of '1's in `s`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `a` and `b` based on the number of '1's in `s` are still valid, but `b` is now always 'SQUARE'.
