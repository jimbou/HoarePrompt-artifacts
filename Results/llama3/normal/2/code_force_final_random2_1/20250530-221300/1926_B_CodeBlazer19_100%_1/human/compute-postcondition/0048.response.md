Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1' and is the first test case, `stdin` contains `t-2-n-2` test cases. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'.***
