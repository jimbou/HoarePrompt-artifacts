Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, `s` is a string of n characters that are either '0' or '1', stdin contains t-5 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (3 <= n <= 10) followed by n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1'. If the string `s` contains exactly one '1' character, then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'.**

The code reads a string `s` from the input, which is a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `t-5` test cases, each containing an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1'. The conditions for `a` and `b` are still valid based on the number of '1' characters in the string `s`.
