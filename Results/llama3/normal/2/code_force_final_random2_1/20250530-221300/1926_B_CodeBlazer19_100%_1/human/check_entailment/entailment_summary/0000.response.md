Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program checks if a row contains exactly one '1' or more than one '1' and prints 'TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE' accordingly. However, this approach is not sufficient to determine the shape type.

A triangle can have more than one '1' in a row, and a square can have exactly one '1' in a row. The program does not consider the position of the '1's in the grid, which is crucial in determining the shape type.

For example, the input:

    3
    000
    011
    011

should output 'TRIANGLE', but the program will output 'SQUARE' because the second and third rows contain more than one '1'.

Similarly, the input:

    4
    0000
    0000
    0100
    1110

should output 'TRIANGLE', but the program will output 'SQUARE' because the fourth row contains more than one '1'.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
