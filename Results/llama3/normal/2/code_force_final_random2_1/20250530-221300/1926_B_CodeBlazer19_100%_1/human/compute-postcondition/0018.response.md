The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1 so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, `s` is a string of n characters that are either '0' or '1', stdin contains t-4 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (3 <= n <= 10) followed by n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1'. If the string `s` contains exactly one '1' character, then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'.**
