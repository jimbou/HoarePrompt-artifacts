Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 3 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, `s` is a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1' and is the first test case, stdin contains `t-5-n-1` test cases. If the string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be the first test case from the input, and the number of test cases in the input has been reduced by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
