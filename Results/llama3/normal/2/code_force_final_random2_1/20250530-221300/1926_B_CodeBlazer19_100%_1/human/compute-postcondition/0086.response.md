Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, i is 2, n is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than or equal to 0, j is n, s is a string of n characters that are either '0' or '1', a is 'TRIANGLE' if any of the strings s contains exactly one '1', otherwise a is 0, b is 'SQUARE' if any of the strings s contains more than one '1', otherwise b is an empty string, stdin contains t-2-n-1 test cases.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. The value of `j` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `s` is still a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1', but its value is now the last test case. The value of `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if any of the strings `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise it is 0. The value of `b` is 'SQUARE' if any of the strings `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise it is an empty string. The number of test cases in `stdin` is now `t-2-n-1`.
