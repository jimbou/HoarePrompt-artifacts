Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 3 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, `s` is a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1' and is the first test case, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', stdin contains `t-5-n-1` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to 'SQUARE', regardless of the previous conditions. The other variables remain unchanged, and their values are still valid as per the initial state. The string `s` is still a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1' and is the first test case. The value of `a` is still dependent on the string `s`, but the value of `b` is now fixed as 'SQUARE'.
