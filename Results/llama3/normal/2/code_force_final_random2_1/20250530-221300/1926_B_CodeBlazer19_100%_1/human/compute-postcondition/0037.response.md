Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is 0, `s` is a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1' and contains exactly one '1', `stdin` contains `t-2-n-1` test cases, `a` is 'TRIANGLE', `b` is an empty string**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` has been changed to 'TRIANGLE', while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
