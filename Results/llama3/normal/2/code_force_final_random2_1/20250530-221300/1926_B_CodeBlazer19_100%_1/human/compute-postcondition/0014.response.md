Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is a string of n characters that are either '0' or '1', `a` is 'TRIANGLE', stdin contains t-4 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1'. If the string `s` contains exactly one '1' character, then `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then `b` is 'SQUARE'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` is now 'TRIANGLE'. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `j`, and `s` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `b` is still dependent on the number of '1' characters in the string `s`. The stdin still contains t-4 test cases.
