Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, i is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than or equal to 0, j is n, s is a string of n characters that are either '0' or '1', stdin contains t-2-n test cases. If s contains exactly one '1', then a is 'TRIANGLE' and b is an empty string. If s contains more than one '1', then a is 0 and b is 'SQUARE'.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that the variable `j` has been incremented to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `s`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` depend on the number of '1's in the string `s`, which is determined by the input provided during the loop's execution.
