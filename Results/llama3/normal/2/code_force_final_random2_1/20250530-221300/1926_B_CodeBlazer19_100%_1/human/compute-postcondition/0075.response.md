Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if the string `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE' if the string `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise `b` is an empty string, `s` is a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1', stdin contains `t-4-n-1` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to the input string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1'. The values of `a` and `b` are determined based on the number of '1's in the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin has been reduced by 1.
