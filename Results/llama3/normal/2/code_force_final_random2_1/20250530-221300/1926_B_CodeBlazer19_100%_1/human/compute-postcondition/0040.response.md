Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is 0, `s` is a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1', `stdin` contains `t-2-n-1` test cases, `a` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE'. The number of '1' in `s` is greater than 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the variable `b` has been assigned the string value 'SQUARE'. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on the variables, such as the range of `t` and `n`, the length and content of `s`, and the number of test cases in `stdin`, are still valid.
