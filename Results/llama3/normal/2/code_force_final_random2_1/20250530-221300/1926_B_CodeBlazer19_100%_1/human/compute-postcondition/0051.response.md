Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, `s` is a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1' and is the second test case, `a` is 'TRIANGLE', `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE', `stdin` contains `t-3-n-2` test cases. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `b` is 'SQUARE'.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 'TRIANGLE'. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `b` is still dependent on the number of '1's in the string `s`. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `b` is 'SQUARE'.
