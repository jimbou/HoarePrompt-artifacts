Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input is:

```
4
0000
0000
0100
1110
```

The program will output "SQUARE" because it only checks if there is a row with more than one '1', but it does not check if the '1's are consecutive or if the shape is a square. In this case, the shape is a triangle, not a square.

The program needs to be modified to correctly identify the shape of the '1's in the grid. It should check if the '1's are consecutive and if the shape is a square or a triangle.
