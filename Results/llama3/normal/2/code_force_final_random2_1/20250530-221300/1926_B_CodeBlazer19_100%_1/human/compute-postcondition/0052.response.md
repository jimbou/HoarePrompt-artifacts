Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, `s` is a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1' and is the second test case, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', stdin contains `t-3-n-2` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to 'SQUARE', regardless of the previous conditions. The other variables remain unchanged, and their previous conditions still apply. The value of `a` is still dependent on the number of '1's in string `s`, but `b` is now always 'SQUARE'.
