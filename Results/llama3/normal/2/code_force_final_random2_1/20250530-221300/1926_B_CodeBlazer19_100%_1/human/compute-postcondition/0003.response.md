The only variable in the loop head is variable j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, i is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive, a is 0, b is an empty string, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1'. But these states do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to n is greater than 0 and j is now 0.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, i is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than 0, a is 0, b is an empty string, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1', j is 0**
