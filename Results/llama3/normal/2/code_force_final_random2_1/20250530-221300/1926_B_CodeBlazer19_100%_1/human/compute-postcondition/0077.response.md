Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if the string `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `s` is a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1', stdin contains `t-4-n-1` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to 'SQUARE', regardless of the original value of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `a` still depends on the number of '1's in the string `s`. The stdin still contains `t-4-n-1` test cases.
