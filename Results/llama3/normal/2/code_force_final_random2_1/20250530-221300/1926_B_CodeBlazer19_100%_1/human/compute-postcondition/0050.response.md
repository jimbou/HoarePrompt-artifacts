Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 10 inclusive and must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, `s` is a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1' and is the second test case, `stdin` contains `t-3-n-2` test cases. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to the second test case, which is a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1'. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `j` remain the same. The number of test cases in `stdin` has decreased by 1. The conditions for `a` and `b` are still dependent on the number of '1's in `s`.
