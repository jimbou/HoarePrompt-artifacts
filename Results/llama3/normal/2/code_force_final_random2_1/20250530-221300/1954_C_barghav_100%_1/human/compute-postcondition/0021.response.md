Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of digits from 1 to 9 with at least 2 digits, `b` is a list of digits from 1 to 9, `stdin` contains t-1 integers followed by 2(t-1) lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9, and `i` is 1. If `a[1]` is greater than `b[1]`, then `a[1]` and `b[1]` are swapped. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
