Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, `b` is a list of digits from 1 to 9, `stdin` contains t-1 integers followed by 2(t-1) lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9, and `i` is 2. If the third element of `a` is greater than the third element of `b`, then the third element of `a` is swapped with the third element of `b`.***
