Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, `b` is a list of digits from 1 to 9, `stdin` contains t-1 integers followed by 2(t-1) lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9, and `i` is 2. If `f` is 0, then if the second element of `a` is less than the second element of `b`, the elements at index 2 of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `f` is 1. If the second element of `a` is greater than the second element of `b`, then `f` is 1. Otherwise, no change is made. If `f` is not 0, then if the third element of `a` is greater than the third element of `b`, the third element of `a` is swapped with the third element of `b`.***
