Based on the precondition, we know that `a` is a list of digits from 1 to 9 that is sorted in ascending order and has at least 1 element. We also know that `i` is 0.

When the print statement `print(a[i], end='')` is executed, it will print the element at index `i` of the list `a`. Since `i` is 0, it will print the first element of the list `a`.

Since `a` is sorted in ascending order, the first element of the list `a` is the smallest digit in the list, which is 1.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **1**
