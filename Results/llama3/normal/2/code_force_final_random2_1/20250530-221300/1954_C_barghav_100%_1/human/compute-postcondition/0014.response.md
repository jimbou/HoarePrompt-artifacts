Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, `b` is a list of digits from 1 to 9, `stdin` contains t-1 integers followed by 2(t-1) lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 0. If `f` is 0, then if the element at index `i` of list `a` is less than the element at index `i` of list `b`, `f` is set to 1. Otherwise, `f` remains 0. If `f` is not 0, then if `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`, the current value of `a[i]` is less than the current value of `b[i]`.***
