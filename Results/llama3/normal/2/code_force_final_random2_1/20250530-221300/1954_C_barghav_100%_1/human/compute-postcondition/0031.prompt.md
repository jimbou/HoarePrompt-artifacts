Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of digits from 1 to 9, b is a list of digits from 1 to 9, f is 0, stdin contains t-1 integers followed by 2(t-1) lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if f == 0:
        if a[i] < b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
            f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            f = 1
    elif a[i] > b[i]:
        a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, `b` is a list of digits from 1 to 9, `stdin` contains t-1 integers followed by 2(t-1) lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 0. If `f` is 0, then if the element at index `i` of list `a` is less than the element at index `i` of list `b`, `f` is set to 1. Otherwise, `f` remains 0. If `f` is not 0, then if `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`, the current value of `a[i]` is less than the current value of `b[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a list of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, `b` is a list of digits from 1 to 9, `stdin` contains t-1 integers followed by 2(t-1) lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9, and `i` is 1. If `f` is 0, then if `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`, the second elements of `a` and `b` are swapped and `f` is set to 1. If `a[i]` is greater than or equal to `b[i]`, then `f` is set to 1. If `f` is not 0, then if `a[1]` is greater than `b[1]`, `a[1]` and `b[1]` are swapped. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a list of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, `b` is a list of digits from 1 to 9, `stdin` contains t-1 integers followed by 2(t-1) lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9, and `i` is 2. If `f` is 0, then if the second element of `a` is less than the second element of `b`, the elements at index 2 of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `f` is 1. If the second element of `a` is greater than the second element of `b`, then `f` is 1. Otherwise, no change is made. If `f` is not 0, then if the third element of `a` is greater than the third element of `b`, the third element of `a` is swapped with the third element of `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
