The code swaps the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Since `i` is 2, this means that the third elements of `a` and `b` are swapped.

Output State: **`a` is a list of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, where the third element is now equal to the third element of the original `b`, `b` is a list of digits from 1 to 9, where the third element is now equal to the third element of the original `a`, `stdin` contains t-1 integers followed by 2(t-1) lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9, and `i` is 2.**
