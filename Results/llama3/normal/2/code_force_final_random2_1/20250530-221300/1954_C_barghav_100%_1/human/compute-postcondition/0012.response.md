Output State: **`a` is a list of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, `b` is a list of digits from 1 to 9, `f` is not equal to 0, `stdin` contains t-1 integers followed by 2(t-1) lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 0. The current value of `a[i]` is less than the current value of `b[i]`.**

The code swaps the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, so the current value of `a[i]` is now less than the current value of `b[i]`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
