Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, `b` is a list of digits from 1 to 9, `stdin` contains t-1 integers followed by 2(t-1) lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 0. If the element at index `i` of list `a` is larger than the element at index `i` of list `b`, then `f` is 1. Otherwise, `f` remains 0.***
