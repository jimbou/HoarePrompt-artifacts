The code prints the element at index `i` of the list `a`. Since `i` is 1 and `a` is a list of digits from 1 to 9 that is sorted in ascending order, the element at index 1 is the second smallest digit in the list. Given that the list contains digits from 1 to 9, the second smallest digit is 2.

Output: **2**
