To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `a` has at least 1 digit. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `a` must have at least 2 digits.

State: **`a` is a list of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, `b` is a list of digits from 1 to 9, `stdin` contains t-1 integers followed by 2(t-1) lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 1.**
