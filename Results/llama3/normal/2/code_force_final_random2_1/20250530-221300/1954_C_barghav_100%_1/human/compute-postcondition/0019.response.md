Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, `b` is a list of digits from 1 to 9, `stdin` contains t-1 integers followed by 2(t-1) lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`, then the second elements of `a` and `b` are swapped and `f` is set to 1. If `a[i]` is greater than or equal to `b[i]`, then `f` is set to 1.***
