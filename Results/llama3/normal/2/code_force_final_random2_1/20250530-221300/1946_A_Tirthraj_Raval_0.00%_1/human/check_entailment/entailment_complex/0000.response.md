Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
3. It sorts the array `a` in ascending order using the `sort()` method.
4. It calculates the index `p` of the middle element of the sorted array using the formula `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. This is correct because the median of an array is the middle element when the array is sorted in ascending order.
5. It counts the occurrences of the middle element `a[p]` in the sorted array using the `count()` method and stores the result in `res`.
6. It prints the count `res` for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. By counting the occurrences of the middle element, it effectively determines the number of elements that need to be increased to make the median greater than its current value.

Correctness: **True**
