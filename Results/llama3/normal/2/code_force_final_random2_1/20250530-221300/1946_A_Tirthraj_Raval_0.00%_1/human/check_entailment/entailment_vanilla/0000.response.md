Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum number of operations to increase the median of an array. The median is the middle value in the sorted array. If the array has an odd length, the median is the middle value. If the array has an even length, the median is the average of the two middle values.

The given program sorts the array and finds the median. It then counts the number of occurrences of the median value in the array. This count is the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

Here's why this approach is correct:

*   Sorting the array is necessary to find the median.
*   Finding the median is correct because it uses the formula `(n + 1) // 2 - 1` to calculate the index of the median, which handles both odd and even length arrays correctly.
*   Counting the occurrences of the median value is correct because increasing any of these values will increase the median. The minimum number of operations is equal to the number of occurrences of the median value.

However, there is a small mistake in the given program. The line `p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1` should be `p = (n - 1) // 2` to correctly calculate the index of the median.

Corrected Code:

```python
def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        p = (n - 1) // 2
        res = a.count(a[p])
        print(res)
```

Correctness: **False**
