To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0 (since `_` is a throwaway variable, it can take any value, but for the sake of clarity, we'll set it to 0).

State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0**
