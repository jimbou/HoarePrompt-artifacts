Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Here's why:

1. The program first sorts the array in ascending order.
2. It then calculates the index `p` of the median element using the formula `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, where `n` is the length of the array. This formula works because the median is the middle element of the sorted array, and the index of the middle element is `(n - 1) // 2` for even-length arrays and `n // 2` for odd-length arrays. The `- 1` is necessary because array indices in Python are 0-based.
3. The program then counts the number of occurrences of the median element using the `count` method. This is the minimum number of operations required to increase the median, because each occurrence of the median element must be increased by 1 to increase the median.

The program correctly handles all cases, including:

* Arrays with an odd length, where the median is the middle element.
* Arrays with an even length, where the median is the average of the two middle elements.
* Arrays with duplicate elements, where the median is the middle element of the sorted array.
* Arrays with a single element, where the median is the only element.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work correctly, so I conclude that the program is correct.
