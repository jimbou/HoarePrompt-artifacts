Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the array length for each test case.
2. It sorts the array in ascending order, which is necessary to find the median.
3. It calculates the index of the median element correctly using the formula `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, where `n` is the length of the array.
4. It counts the occurrences of the median element in the sorted array using the `count()` method.
5. It prints the count of the median element for each test case, which represents the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required steps to solve the problem. The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
