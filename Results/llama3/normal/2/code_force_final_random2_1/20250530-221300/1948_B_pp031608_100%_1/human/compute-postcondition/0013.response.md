Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer between 2 and 50 and is greater than 1, arr is a list of m integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is m-2, nums is a list of integers where the first part of the list are the digits of arr[i - 1] converted to integers, and the last element is arr[i], ans is False.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the state of the program.

Therefore, the only change in the state is that `ans` is now `False`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
