Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `arr` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`.**

The code creates a new list `nums` by converting the integer `arr[i - 1]` into a list of its digits and appending `arr[i]` to the end of this list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `nums` now contains the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.
