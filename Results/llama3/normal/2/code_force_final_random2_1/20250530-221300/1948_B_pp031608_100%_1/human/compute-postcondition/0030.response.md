Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `arr` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is 2, `ans` is True, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `nums` is specifically calculated by taking the digits of `arr[i - 1]` (which is an integer between 0 and 99) and appending `arr[i]` to the end of the list. The other variables remain unchanged.
