Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `arr` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is greater than -1 and less than `m`, `ans` is either True or False, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `nums` is a combination of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]`. The digits of `arr[i - 1]` are converted to integers and added to the list, followed by `arr[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
