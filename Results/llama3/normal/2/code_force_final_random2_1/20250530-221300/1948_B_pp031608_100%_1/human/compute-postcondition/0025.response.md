The code prints a string indicating whether the list `nums` is sorted in ascending order or not. The list `nums` is created based on the comparison of adjacent elements in the list `arr`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `nums` is created by taking the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` converted to integers and appending `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is set to `False`, otherwise no change is made. The print statement uses a list `['NO', 'YES']` to map the boolean value of `ans` to a string, where `False` corresponds to `'NO'` and `True` corresponds to `'YES'`.

Output: **n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer between 2 and 50, arr is a list of m integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is 1, and the string indicating whether the list nums is sorted in ascending order or not is printed, where nums is a list of integers created based on the comparison of adjacent elements in the list arr, and the string is either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the boolean value of ans**
