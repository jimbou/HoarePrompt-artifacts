Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `arr` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `m`, `ans` is a boolean value, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`. The current value of `nums` is not sorted in ascending order.***
