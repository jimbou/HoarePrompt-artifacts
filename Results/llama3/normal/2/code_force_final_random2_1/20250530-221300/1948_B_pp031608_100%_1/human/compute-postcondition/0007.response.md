Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer between 2 and 50 and is greater than 1, arr is a list of m integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, ans is False, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is m-1, nums is a list of digits of arr[i - 1] followed by arr[i], the current value of arr[i] is less than the current value of arr[i - 1], and the digits in nums are not in sorted order.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`, which was initially `True`. The second line, `break`, is used to exit the current loop or switch statement, but since there is no loop or switch statement in the provided code snippet, its effect is not applicable in this context.

Therefore, the only change in the output state is the value of `ans`, which is now `False`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
