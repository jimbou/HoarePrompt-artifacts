Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer between 2 and 50 and is greater than 1, arr is a list of m integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is m-2, nums is a list of integers where the first part of the list are the digits of arr[i - 1] converted to integers, and the last element is arr[i], arr[i - 1] is the first digit of the previous value of arr[i - 1] converted to an integer. If nums is not sorted in ascending order, then ans is False. Otherwise, there is no specific value assigned to ans.**

In this output state, the value of arr[i - 1] has been updated to be the first digit of its previous value converted to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.
