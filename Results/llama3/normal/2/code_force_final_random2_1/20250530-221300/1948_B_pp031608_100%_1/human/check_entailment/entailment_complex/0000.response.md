Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted list in non-decreasing order using the given operation.

The program iterates through the array from the end to the beginning. If it finds a pair of adjacent elements where the current element is smaller than the previous one, it checks if the previous element can be split into digits to make the list sorted. If the digits of the previous element are not in sorted order, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks the loop.

After the loop, it prints 'YES' if `ans` is `True` and 'NO' otherwise.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where the input array is already sorted or where the array cannot be made sorted using the given operation.

Correctness: **True**
