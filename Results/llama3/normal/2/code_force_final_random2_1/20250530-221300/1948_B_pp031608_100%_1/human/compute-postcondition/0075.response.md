Output: **n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer and is at least 2, arr is a list of m integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is 0, ans is a boolean value. If the list of integers is sorted, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If the list of integers is not sorted, then ans is False, and 'YES' is printed if ans is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed**
