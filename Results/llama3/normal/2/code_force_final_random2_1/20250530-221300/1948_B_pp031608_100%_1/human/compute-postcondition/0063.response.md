Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer and is at least 2, arr is a list of m integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is greater than -1 and less than m, ans is False, nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of arr[i - 1] and the last element is arr[i].**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = False` and `break`. The first line sets the value of `ans` to `False`. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop it is part of. However, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the state of the program. 

Therefore, the only change in the state is that `ans` is now `False`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
