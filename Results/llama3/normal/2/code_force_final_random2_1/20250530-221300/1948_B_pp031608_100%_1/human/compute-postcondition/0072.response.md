Postcondition: **n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer and is at least 2, arr is a list of m integers where each integer is between 0 and 99. If the list of integers is sorted, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If the list of integers is not sorted, then ans is False, i is 2, and arr[i] is less than arr[i - 1].**
