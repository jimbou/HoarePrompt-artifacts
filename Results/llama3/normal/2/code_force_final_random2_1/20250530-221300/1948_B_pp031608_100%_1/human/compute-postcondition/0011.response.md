To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):`.

The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 and is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is `m-2`.**
