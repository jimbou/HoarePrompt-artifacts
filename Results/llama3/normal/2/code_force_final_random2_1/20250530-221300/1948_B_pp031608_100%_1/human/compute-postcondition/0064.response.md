Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer and is at least 2, arr is a list of m integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is greater than -1 and less than m, if the list of integers nums is not sorted, then ans is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
