Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 50), stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    m = int(input())
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    ans = True
    for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
        if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
            nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
            if nums != sorted(nums):
                ans = False
                break
            arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
    print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer between 2 and 50, arr is a list of m integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is 1, and the string indicating whether the list nums is sorted in ascending order or not is printed, where nums is a list of integers created based on the comparison of adjacent elements in the list arr, and the string is either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the boolean value of ans

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `arr` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is 0, `ans` is a boolean value. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]` at any point during the loop execution, then `arr[i - 1]` is the first digit of its original value, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted in ascending order at any point during the loop execution, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True, and either 'NO' or 'YES' is printed depending on whether `ans` is False or True respectively

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer and is at least 2, arr is a list of m integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is 0, ans is a boolean value. If the list of integers is sorted, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If the list of integers is not sorted, then ans is False, and 'YES' is printed if ans is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
