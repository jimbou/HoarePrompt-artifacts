Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 and is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, `ans` is True, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is `m-1`, `nums` is a list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `ans`, `stdin`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `nums`, which is a list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. This is because the code snippet converts the integer `arr[i - 1]` to a string, splits it into individual digits, converts each digit back to an integer, and then appends `arr[i]` to the end of the list. The condition that the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]` still holds true.
