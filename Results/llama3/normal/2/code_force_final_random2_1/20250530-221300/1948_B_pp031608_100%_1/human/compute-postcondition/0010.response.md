Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 and is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is `m-1`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `ans` is False if the digits in `nums` (a list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`) are not in sorted order. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.***
