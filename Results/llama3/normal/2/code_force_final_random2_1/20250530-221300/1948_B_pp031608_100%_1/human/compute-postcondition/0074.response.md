Based on the initial state, the code will print either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the value of the variable `ans`.

The variable `ans` is a boolean value that indicates whether the list of integers `arr` is sorted or not. If the list is sorted, `ans` remains unchanged, and if the list is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False`.

Since `ans` is a boolean value, it can only be either `True` or `False`. The print statement uses a list indexing syntax to select either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the value of `ans`. If `ans` is `True`, the index will be 1, and 'YES' will be printed. If `ans` is `False`, the index will be 0, and 'NO' will be printed.

Therefore, the output will be either 'YES' if the list `arr` is sorted, or 'NO' if the list is not sorted.

Output: **'YES' if the list arr is sorted, 'NO' if the list arr is not sorted**
