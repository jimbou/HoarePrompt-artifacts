Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer and is at least 2, arr is a list of m integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is 0, ans is a boolean value.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `m` is updated to be the integer value of the input, which is at least 2. The list `arr` is updated to contain `m` integers, each between 0 and 99, which are the values from the input. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 2, as two inputs are consumed by the code. The value of `i` remains 0, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `ans` is initialized to True, but its final value depends on the values in `arr` and the execution of the loop, which is not shown in this code snippet.
