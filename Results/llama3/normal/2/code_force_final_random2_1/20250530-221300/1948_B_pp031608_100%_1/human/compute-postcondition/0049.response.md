The code prints a string indicating whether the list `nums` is sorted in ascending order or not. The string is chosen from the list `['NO', 'YES']` based on the value of the boolean variable `ans`. If `ans` is True, it means that `nums` is sorted in ascending order, so the code prints 'YES'. If `ans` is False, it means that `nums` is not sorted in ascending order, so the code prints 'NO'.

Output: **'YES' if nums is sorted in ascending order, 'NO' otherwise**
