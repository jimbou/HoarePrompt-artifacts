Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer and is at least 2, arr is a list of m integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, stdin contains t-4 test cases, i is 2, nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of arr[i - 1] and the last element is arr[i], ans is False.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the state of the variables.

The initial state of the variables remains unchanged except for `ans`, which is now assigned the value `False`. The values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `stdin`, `i`, and `nums` remain the same as they were before the execution of the code snippet.
