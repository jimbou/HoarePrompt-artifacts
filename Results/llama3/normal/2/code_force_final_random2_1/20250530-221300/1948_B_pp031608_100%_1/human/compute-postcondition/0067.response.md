The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be 2.
State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer and is at least 2, arr is a list of m integers where each integer is between 0 and 99. If the list of integers is sorted, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If the list of integers is not sorted, then ans is False, i is 2**
