Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `arr` is a list of `m` integers where the `i-th` integer is the first digit of `nums` and the rest are between 0 and 99, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, `ans` is not explicitly set.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `arr[i - 1]` has been updated to be the first digit of `nums`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` now contains the first digit of `nums` at the `i-th` position, and the rest of the elements are between 0 and 99. The other variables, including `n`, `m`, `stdin`, `i`, and `nums`, retain their original values and properties.
