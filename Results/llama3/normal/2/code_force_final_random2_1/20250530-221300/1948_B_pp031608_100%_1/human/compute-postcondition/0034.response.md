The code assigns the value of `nums[0]` to `arr[i - 1]`. The value of `nums[0]` is the first digit of `arr[i - 1]`, which is an integer between 0 and 99. Therefore, the value of `arr[i - 1]` is updated to be the first digit of its original value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `arr` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, `arr[i - 1]` is the first digit of its original value, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is 2, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`. If `nums` is not sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.**
