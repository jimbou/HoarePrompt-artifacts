Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `arr` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is 2. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is the first digit of its original value, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.***
