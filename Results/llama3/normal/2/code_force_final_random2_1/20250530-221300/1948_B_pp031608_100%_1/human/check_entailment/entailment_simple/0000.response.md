Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order using the given operation.

The program iterates over the array from the end to the beginning. If it finds a pair of adjacent elements where the previous element is greater than the current element, it checks if the previous element can be split into digits that are in non-decreasing order along with the current element. If it can, it replaces the previous element with the first digit of the split. If it cannot, it sets the answer to False and breaks the loop.

After the loop, it prints 'YES' if the answer is True and 'NO' otherwise.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where the array is already sorted or where the array cannot be sorted using the given operation.

Correctness: **True**
