Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer (2 <= n <= 50), m is an integer (2 <= m <= 50), arr is a list of m integers (0 <= a_i <= 99), ans is True, stdin contains t-2 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 and is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is `m-1`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `ans` is False if the digits in `nums` (a list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`) are not in sorted order. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer between 2 and 50 and is greater than 1, arr is a list of m integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is m-2. If arr[i] is less than arr[i - 1], then nums is a list of integers where the first part of the list are the digits of arr[i - 1] converted to integers, and the last element is arr[i], arr[i - 1] is the first digit of the previous value of arr[i - 1] converted to an integer. If nums is not sorted in ascending order, then ans is False. Otherwise, there is no specific value assigned to ans. If arr[i] is not less than arr[i - 1], then no specific operation is performed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 and is greater than 2, `arr` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is `m-3`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is the first digit of the original `arr[i - 1]` converted to an integer, and `nums` is a list of integers where the first part of the list are the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` converted to integers, and the last element is `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is `False`. Otherwise, no change is made. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, then no specific operation is performed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
