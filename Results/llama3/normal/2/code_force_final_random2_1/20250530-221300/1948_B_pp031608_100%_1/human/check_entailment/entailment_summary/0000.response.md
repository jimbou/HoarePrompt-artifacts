Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make a sorted array in non-decreasing order using the given operation. The program iterates over the array from right to left, and whenever it encounters a pair of elements that are not in non-decreasing order, it checks if the larger element can be split into digits that can be inserted in the correct order. If this is not possible, it sets the answer to False and breaks the loop. Finally, it prints 'YES' if the answer is True and 'NO' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
