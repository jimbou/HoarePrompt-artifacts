Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `arr` is a list of `m` integers where the integer at index `i-1` is equal to `nums[0]` and the other integers are between 0 and 99, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `m`. If the list `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `arr[i-1]` has been updated to `nums[0]`, while the other elements in the list `arr` remain unchanged. The values of `n`, `m`, `stdin`, `i`, and `ans` are not affected by the code and remain the same as in the initial state.
