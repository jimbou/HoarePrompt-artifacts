Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `arr` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is 2, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`.**

The code creates a new list `nums` by converting the digits of `arr[i - 1]` to integers and appending `arr[i]` to the end. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. The value of `nums` depends on the values of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]`, which are specific elements of the list `arr`. The output state includes all the information from the initial state that is still valid after the code has been executed, with the updated value of `nums`.
