Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer between 3 and 50 and is greater than 2, arr is a list of m integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is m-3, nums is a list of integers where the first part of the list are the digits of arr[i - 1] converted to integers, and the last element is arr[i], ans is False**.

The code snippet does not modify the values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `stdin`, `i`, or `nums`. The only change is the assignment of `False` to the variable `ans`.
