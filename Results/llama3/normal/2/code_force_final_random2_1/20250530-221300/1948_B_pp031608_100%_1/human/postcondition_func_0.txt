The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then checks if the integers can be transformed into a sorted list by repeatedly replacing the first digit of an integer with the smallest digit of the original integer, if the integer is smaller than the previous one. The function prints 'YES' if the transformation is possible and 'NO' otherwise.
