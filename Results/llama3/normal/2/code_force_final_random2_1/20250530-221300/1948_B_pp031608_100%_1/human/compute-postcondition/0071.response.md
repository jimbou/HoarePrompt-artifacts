Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `arr` is a list of `m` integers where the `i-1`th integer is the first element of `nums` and the other integers are between 0 and 99, `nums` is a list of integers where the first `len(str(arr[i - 1]))` elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`, if the list of integers is sorted then the state of the variables remains unchanged, if the list of integers is not sorted then `ans` is False, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `arr[i - 1]` has been updated to be the first element of `nums`. The other elements of `arr` remain unchanged. The list `nums` still contains the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `i` are unchanged. The state of the variables `ans` is still dependent on whether the list of integers is sorted or not.
