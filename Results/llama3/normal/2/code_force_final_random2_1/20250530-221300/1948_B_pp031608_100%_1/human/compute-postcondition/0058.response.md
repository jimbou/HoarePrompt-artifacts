Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `arr` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `m`. If the list `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
