Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer between 3 and 50 and is greater than 2, arr is a list of m integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is m-3, nums is a list of integers where the first part of the list are the digits of arr[i - 1] converted to integers, and the last element is arr[i]. If nums is not sorted, then ans is False. Otherwise, no change is made.***
