Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer and is at least 2, arr is a list of m integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, stdin contains 0 test cases, i is 0, ans is a boolean value. If arr[i] is less than arr[i - 1] at any point during the loop execution, then arr[i - 1] is the first digit of its original value, nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of arr[i - 1] and the last element is arr[i]. If nums is not sorted in ascending order at any point during the loop execution, then ans is False. Otherwise, ans remains True, and either 'NO' or 'YES' is printed depending on whether ans is False or True respectively.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the initial state of the variables remains unchanged, except for the variables in the loop head and body. The loop has processed all the test cases in the input, and the final state of the variables reflects the result of the last test case. The value of `i` is 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The value of `ans` is a boolean value that indicates whether the list of integers is sorted in ascending order or not. If the list is sorted, `ans` is True, and 'YES' is printed. If the list is not sorted, `ans` is False, and 'NO' is printed.
