Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer and is at least 2, arr is a list of m integers where each integer is between 0 and 99 and the integer at index i-1 is equal to nums[0], stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is greater than -1 and less than m, if the list of integers nums is not sorted, then ans is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of the integer at index i-1 in the list arr is updated to be equal to the first element of the list nums. The other variables remain unchanged, with n still between 2 and 50, m still at least 2, and the list arr still containing m integers between 0 and 99. The stdin still contains t-5 test cases, and i is still greater than -1 and less than m. If the list nums is not sorted, then ans is still False.
