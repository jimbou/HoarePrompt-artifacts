Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `nums` is assigned a new value, which is a list of integers.
2. The list comprehension `[int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])]` converts the integer `arr[i - 1]` to a string, then iterates over each character in the string, converts it back to an integer, and adds it to the list.
3. The expression `[arr[i]]` adds the integer `arr[i]` to the end of the list.

Now, let's consider the initial state:

* `n` is an integer between 2 and 50.
* `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 and is greater than 1.
* `arr` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is between 0 and 99.
* `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases.
* `i` is `m-2`.

Since `i` is `m-2`, we know that `i` is an integer between 0 and 48 (since `m` is between 2 and 50).

The value of `arr[i - 1]` is an integer between 0 and 99, and `str(arr[i - 1])` is a string representation of that integer. The list comprehension `[int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])]` will convert each digit of that integer to an integer, so the resulting list will have a length equal to the number of digits in `arr[i - 1]`.

The value of `arr[i]` is also an integer between 0 and 99.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 and is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is `m-2`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first part of the list are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` converted to integers, and the last element is `arr[i]`.**
