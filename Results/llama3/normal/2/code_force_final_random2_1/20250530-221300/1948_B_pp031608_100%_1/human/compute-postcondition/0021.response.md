Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 and is greater than 2, `arr` is a list of `m` integers where `arr[i - 1]` is the first digit of the original `arr[i - 1]` converted to an integer and the rest of the integers are between 0 and 99, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is `m-3`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first part of the list are the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` converted to integers, and the last element is `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is `False`. Otherwise, no change is made.**

In this output state, the value of `arr[i - 1]` has been updated to be the first digit of the original `arr[i - 1]` converted to an integer. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` still contains `m` integers, but the value of `arr[i - 1]` has been modified. The other variables, including `n`, `m`, `stdin`, `i`, `nums`, and `ans`, retain their original values and properties.
