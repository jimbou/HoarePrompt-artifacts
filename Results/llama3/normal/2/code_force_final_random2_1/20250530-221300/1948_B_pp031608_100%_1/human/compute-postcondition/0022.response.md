Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 and is greater than 2, `arr` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is `m-3`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is the first digit of the original `arr[i - 1]` converted to an integer, and `nums` is a list of integers where the first part of the list are the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` converted to integers, and the last element is `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is `False`. Otherwise, no change is made. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, then no specific operation is performed.***
