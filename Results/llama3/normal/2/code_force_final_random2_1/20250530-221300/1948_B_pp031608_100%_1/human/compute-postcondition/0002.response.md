Output State: **n is an integer (2 <= n <= 50), m is an integer (2 <= m <= 50), arr is a list of m integers (0 <= a_i <= 99), ans is True, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code. The variable `m` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 2 and 50 (inclusive). The list `arr` is populated with `m` integers from the input, each between 0 and 99 (inclusive). The variable `ans` is initialized to `True`. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1, now containing t-2 test cases.
