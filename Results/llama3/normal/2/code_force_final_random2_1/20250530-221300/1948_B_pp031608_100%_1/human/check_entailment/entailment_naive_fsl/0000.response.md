Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in all cases. For example, if the input is:

3
4
12 3 45 67

The program will output "YES", but it should output "NO" because the array [1, 2, 3, 45, 67] is not sorted in non-decreasing order.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the current element is less than the previous element, and if so, it tries to split the previous element into digits and checks if the resulting array is sorted. However, this approach is not sufficient to guarantee that the entire array can be made sorted in non-decreasing order.

A correct approach would be to iterate through the array from left to right, and for each element, check if it can be split into digits that are in non-decreasing order. If not, the program should output "NO". If the program can successfully iterate through the entire array without finding any elements that cannot be split into digits in non-decreasing order, it should output "YES".
