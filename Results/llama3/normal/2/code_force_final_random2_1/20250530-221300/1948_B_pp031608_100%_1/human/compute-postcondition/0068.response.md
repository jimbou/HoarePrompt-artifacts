Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `arr` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, `nums` is a list of integers where the first `len(str(arr[i - 1]))` elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`, if the list of integers is sorted then the state of the variables remains unchanged, if the list of integers is not sorted then `ans` is False, `i` is 2**.

In natural language, the output state is that the variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the list `arr` also remains unchanged. A new list `nums` is created, which contains the digits of the integer at index `i-1` in `arr`, followed by the integer at index `i` in `arr`. The state of the variables `ans` and `i` is updated only if the list `arr` is not sorted.
