According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 50) and stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99). So for the loop to be executed  the variable n must be greater than 0.
State: **`n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 50), stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), n must be greater than 0**
