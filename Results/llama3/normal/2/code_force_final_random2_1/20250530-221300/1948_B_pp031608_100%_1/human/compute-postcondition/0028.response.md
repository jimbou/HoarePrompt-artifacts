According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `m` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 2 and `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, so we can adjust the state of `i` and `m` to ensure the loop can execute. Since `i` is already 2, we can keep it as is. For `m`, we can adjust its state to be at least 2.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `arr` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is 2, `ans` is True**
