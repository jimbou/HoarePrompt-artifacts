Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 and is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is `m-1`, `nums` is a list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `arr[i - 1]` is equal to the first digit of the previous `arr[i - 1]`, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`. If the digits in `nums` are not in sorted order, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `arr[i - 1]` has been updated to be equal to the first digit of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `ans` still apply based on the sorted order of the digits in `nums`.
