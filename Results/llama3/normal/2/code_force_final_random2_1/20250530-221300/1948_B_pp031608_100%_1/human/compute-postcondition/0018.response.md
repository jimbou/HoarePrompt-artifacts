Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 and is greater than 2, `arr` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is `m-3`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first part of the list are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` converted to integers, and the last element is `arr[i]`.**

In this output state, the code has created a new list `nums` by taking the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and converting them to integers, and then appending `arr[i]` to the end of the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `nums` is now a list of integers, where the first part of the list are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` converted to integers, and the last element is `arr[i]`.
