Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer and is at least 2, arr is a list of m integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is greater than 0 and less than m, ans is False, nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of arr[i - 1] and the last element is arr[i].**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed within. However, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the program's execution.

Therefore, the only change in the output state is that `ans` is now `False`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
