Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer between 2 and 50, arr is a list of m integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, stdin contains t-4 test cases, i is 2, ans is True, m is an integer, and arr is a list of m integers where each integer is between 0 and 99.**

In this output state, the values of n, i, and the string indicating whether the list nums is sorted in ascending order or not remain unchanged. The value of m is updated to the integer value of the input, and the list arr is updated to a list of m integers where each integer is between 0 and 99. The variable ans is initialized to True. Stdin now contains t-4 test cases.
