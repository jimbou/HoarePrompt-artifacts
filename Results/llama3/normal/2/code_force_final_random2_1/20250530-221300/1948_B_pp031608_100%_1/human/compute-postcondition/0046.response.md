Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer and is at least 2, arr is a list of m integers where each integer is between 0 and 99 and the third element is the first digit of the previous third element, stdin contains t-4 test cases, i is 2, nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of arr[i - 1] and the last element is arr[i]. If nums is not sorted in ascending order, ans is False. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of the third element in the list `arr` is updated to be the first digit of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` still contains `m` integers between 0 and 99, but the third element is now the first digit of its previous value. The other conditions and values of the variables are still the same as in the initial state.
