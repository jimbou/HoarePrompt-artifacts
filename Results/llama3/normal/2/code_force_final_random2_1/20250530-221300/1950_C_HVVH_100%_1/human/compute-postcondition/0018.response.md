Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1440, `_` is 1, `h` is an integer between 0 and 23, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59, stdin contains t-2 strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, and `day` is 'AM' if `h` is not 12, otherwise `day` is 'PM'.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `_` remain unchanged. The values of `h` and `m` are updated to the hour and minute values extracted from the input string in the format "hh:mm". The stdin now contains t-2 strings, as one string has been consumed by the input operation. The value of `day` is determined based on the value of `h`, which is either 'AM' or 'PM' depending on whether `h` is not 12 or 12, respectively.
