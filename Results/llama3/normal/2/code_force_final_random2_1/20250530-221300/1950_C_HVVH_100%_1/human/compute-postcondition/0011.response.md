Output State: **`day` is 'PM', `n` is an integer between 1 and 1440, `_` is 0, `h` is 12, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59, stdin contains t-1 strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format**

The code changes the value of `day` from 'AM' to 'PM'. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still an integer between 1 and 1440, `_` is still 0, `h` is still 12, and `m` is still an integer between 0 and 59. The stdin still contains t-1 strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format.
