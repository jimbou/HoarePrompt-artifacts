The code prints a formatted string representing the time in 12-hour format, where h is the hour and m is the minute. The hour h is an integer between 1 and 11, and the minute m is an integer between 0 and 59. The day is either 'AM' or 'PM', depending on the value of h. If h is not 12, the day is 'AM', otherwise, it is 'PM'. The hour and minute are formatted as two-digit numbers with leading zeros if necessary.

Output: **hh:mm (where hh is the hour h and mm is the minute m, both formatted as two-digit numbers with leading zeros if necessary), AM/PM (where AM/PM is the day)**
