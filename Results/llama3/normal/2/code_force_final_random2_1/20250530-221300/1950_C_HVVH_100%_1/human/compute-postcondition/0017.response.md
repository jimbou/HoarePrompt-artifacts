The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1440. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **day is 'AM' if h is not 12, otherwise day is 'PM'. n is an integer between 2 and 1440, _ is 1, if h is 0, then h is set to 12. Otherwise, h is an integer between 1 and 11, m is an integer between 0 and 59, stdin contains t-1 strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, and this is printed: a string in the format 'hh:mm' representing the time in 12-hour format, where hh is the hour h padded with a leading zero if necessary, and mm is the minute m padded with a leading zero if necessary, followed by the day which is either 'AM' or 'PM'**
