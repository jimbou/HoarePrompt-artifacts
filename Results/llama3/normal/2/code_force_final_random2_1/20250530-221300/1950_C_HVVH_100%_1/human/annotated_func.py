#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a valid input: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1440) and then t strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format.
    day = 'AM'
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
        
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
            if h == 12:
                day = 'PM'
        
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
        
    #State: day is 'AM' if h is not 12, otherwise day is 'PM'. n is 0, _ is n, if h is 0, then h is set to 12. Otherwise, h is an integer between 1 and 11, m is an integer between 0 and 59, stdin is empty, and this is printed: n strings in the format 'hh:mm' representing the time in 12-hour format, where hh is the hour h padded with a leading zero if necessary, and mm is the minute m padded with a leading zero if necessary, followed by the day which is either 'AM' or 'PM'

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of time inputs in 24-hour format from standard input, converts them to 12-hour format, and prints the converted times along with their respective AM/PM designations. It processes a variable number of inputs, as specified by the first input, and consumes all input until it is exhausted. The function does not return any value, but instead, prints the converted times to the console.
