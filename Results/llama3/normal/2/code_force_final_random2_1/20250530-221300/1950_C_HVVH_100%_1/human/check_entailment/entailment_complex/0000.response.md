Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input and iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the time in 24-hour format (`hh:mm`) and splits it into hours `h` and minutes `m`.
3.  It then converts the 24-hour time to 12-hour format by checking the hour value:

    *   If `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and the day to 'AM'.
    *   If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets the day to 'PM'.
    *   If `h` is less than or equal to 12, it sets the day to 'AM' unless `h` is exactly 12, in which case it sets the day to 'PM'.
4.  Finally, it prints the converted time in 12-hour format (`hh:mm`) followed by the day ('AM' or 'PM').

The program correctly handles all possible cases for the hour value and produces the expected output in 12-hour format.

Correctness: **True**
