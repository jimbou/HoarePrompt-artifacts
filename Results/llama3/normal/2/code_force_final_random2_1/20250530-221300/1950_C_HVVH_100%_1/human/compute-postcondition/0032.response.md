Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1440, `_` is 2, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59, `h` is an integer between 0 and 23, `day` is 'AM'**.

In this output state, the value of `day` has been updated to 'AM', regardless of the previous value of `h`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains t-2 strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format.
