Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: day is 'AM', n is an integer between 1 and 1440, stdin contains t strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
    if h == 0:
        h = 12
        day = 'AM'
    elif h > 12:
        h = h - 12
        day = 'PM'
    else:
        day = 'AM'
        if h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
    print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: day is 'AM' if h is not 12, otherwise day is 'PM'. n is an integer between 1 and 1440, _ is 0, if h is 0, then h is set to 12. Otherwise, h is an integer between 1 and 11, m is an integer between 0 and 59, stdin contains t-1 strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, and this is printed: a string in the format 'hh:mm' representing the time in 12-hour format, where hh is the hour h padded with a leading zero if necessary, and mm is the minute m padded with a leading zero if necessary, followed by the day which is either 'AM' or 'PM'

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1440, `_` is 1, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59, stdin contains t-2 strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. If `h` is 0, `h` is 12 and `day` is 'PM'. If `h` is not 0, if `h` is greater than 12, `h` is an integer between -12 and 11 and `day` is 'PM'. If `h` is not greater than 12, `h` is an integer between 0 and 23 and `day` is 'AM' if `h` is not 12, otherwise `day` is 'PM', and this is printed: a string representing the time in the format hh:mm, where hh is the hour `h` formatted as a two-digit number with leading zeros if necessary, and mm is the minute `m` formatted as a two-digit number with leading zeros if necessary, followed by the day of the day `day`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1440, `_` is 2, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59, stdin contains t-2 strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. If `h` is 0, `h` is 12 and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` is not 0, `h` is an integer between -12 and 23, if `h` is greater than 12, `h` is an integer between -12 and 11 and `day` is 'PM'. If `h` is not greater than 12, `h` is an integer between 0 and 23, if `h` is 12, then `day` is 'PM', otherwise `day` is 'AM', and this is printed: a string in the format 'hh:mm' representing the time, where 'hh' is the hour in 24-hour format and 'mm' is the minute, and the day, either 'AM' or 'PM'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
