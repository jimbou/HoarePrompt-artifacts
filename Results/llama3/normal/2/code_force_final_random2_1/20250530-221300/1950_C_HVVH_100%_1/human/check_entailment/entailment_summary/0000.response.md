Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly converts the time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and prints the converted time along with the AM/PM designation.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first checks if the hour is 0, in which case it sets the hour to 12 and the day to 'AM'.
2. If the hour is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from the hour and sets the day to 'PM'.
3. If the hour is not 0 and not greater than 12, it sets the day to 'AM'. However, if the hour is 12, it sets the day to 'PM'.
4. It then prints the converted time in the format 'hh:mm' followed by the day ('AM' or 'PM').

The program correctly handles all possible cases for the hour and minute values, and it prints the converted time in the required format.

Correctness: **True**
