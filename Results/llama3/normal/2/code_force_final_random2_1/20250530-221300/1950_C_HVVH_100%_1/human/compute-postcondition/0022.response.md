Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1440, `_` is 1, `h` is an integer between 0 and 23, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59, `day` is 'PM', stdin contains t-2 strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format.**

The code changes the value of `day` from 'AM' to 'PM'. The values of the other variables (`n`, `_`, `h`, `m`) and the input in stdin remain unchanged.
