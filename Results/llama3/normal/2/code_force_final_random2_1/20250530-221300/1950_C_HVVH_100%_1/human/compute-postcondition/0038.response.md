Output: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1440, `_` is 2, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59, stdin contains t-2 strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. If `h` is 0, `h` is 12 and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` is not 0, `h` is an integer between -12 and 23, if `h` is greater than 12, `h` is an integer between -12 and 11 and `day` is 'PM'. If `h` is not greater than 12, `h` is an integer between 0 and 23, if `h` is 12, then `day` is 'PM', otherwise `day` is 'AM', and this is printed: a string in the format 'hh:mm' representing the time, where 'hh' is the hour in 24-hour format and 'mm' is the minute, and the day, either 'AM' or 'PM'.**
