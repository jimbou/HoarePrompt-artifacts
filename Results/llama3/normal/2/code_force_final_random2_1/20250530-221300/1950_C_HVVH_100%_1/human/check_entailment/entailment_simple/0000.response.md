Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to convert a given time in 24-hour format to its equivalent time in 12-hour format. The program correctly handles the conversion of hours and minutes, and it also correctly determines whether the time is in the morning (AM) or afternoon/evening (PM).

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. If the hour is 0, it is set to 12 and the day is set to 'AM'. This is correct because 00:00 in 24-hour format is equivalent to 12:00 AM in 12-hour format.

2. If the hour is greater than 12, it is subtracted by 12 and the day is set to 'PM'. This is correct because, for example, 14:00 in 24-hour format is equivalent to 02:00 PM in 12-hour format.

3. If the hour is between 1 and 11, the day is set to 'AM'. However, if the hour is 12, the day is set to 'PM'. This is correct because 12:00 in 24-hour format is equivalent to 12:00 PM in 12-hour format.

4. The program then prints the time in 12-hour format, padding the hour and minute with leading zeros if necessary, followed by the day ('AM' or 'PM').

Based on this analysis, the program correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and handles the AM/PM designation correctly.

Correctness: **True**
