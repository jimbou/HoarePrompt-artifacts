Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the input hour is 12 correctly. According to the problem description, 12:00 should be output as 12:00 PM, but the program outputs 00:00 PM. This is because the program sets `h` to 0 when the input hour is 12, and then formats it as a two-digit number with leading zeros, resulting in 00.

To fix this, the program should handle the case when the input hour is 12 separately, and output 12:00 PM directly.
