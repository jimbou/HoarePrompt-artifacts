Functionality: **This function reads a series of time inputs in 24-hour format from standard input, converts them to 12-hour format, and prints the converted times along with their respective AM/PM designations. It processes a variable number of inputs, as specified by the first input, and consumes all input until it is exhausted. The function does not return any value, but instead, prints the converted times to the console.**
