State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1440, `_` is 2, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59, stdin contains t-1 strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. If `h` is 0, `h` is 12 and `day` is 'PM'. If `h` is not 0, if `h` is greater than 12, `h` is an integer between -12 and 11 and `day` is 'PM'. If `h` is not greater than 12, `h` is an integer between 0 and 23 and `day` is 'AM' if `h` is not 12, otherwise `day` is 'PM', and this is printed: a string representing the time in the format hh:mm, where hh is the hour `h` formatted as a two-digit number with leading zeros if necessary, and mm is the minute `m` formatted as a two-digit number with leading zeros if necessary, followed by the day of the day `day`**
