Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1440, `_` is 2, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59, `h` is an integer between 0 and 23, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59, stdin contains t-2 strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. If `h` is 0, `h` is 12 and `day` is 'PM'. If `h` is not 0, if `h` is greater than 12, `h` is an integer between -12 and 11 and `day` is 'PM'. If `h` is not greater than 12, `h` is an integer between 0 and 23 and `day` is 'AM' if `h` is not 12, otherwise `day` is 'PM'.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `_`, and `m` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `h` is now an integer between 0 and 23, and the value of `m` is now an integer between 0 and 59, as they are assigned the values from the input string. The stdin now contains t-2 strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. The conditions for `h` and `day` are also updated accordingly.
