Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, nalla is 0, x is an integer, s is a list of 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', length is 30, stdin contains t-1 inputs, i is 29.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all 30 iterations, the list `s` will contain 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of the integer `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
