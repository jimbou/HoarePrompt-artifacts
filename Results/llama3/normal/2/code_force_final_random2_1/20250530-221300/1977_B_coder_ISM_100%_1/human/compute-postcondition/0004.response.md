Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an integer, `s` is an empty list, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs, `i` is 0. The current value of `x` has a bit set at position `i` (i.e., the binary representation of `x` has a 1 at the `i-th` position).***
