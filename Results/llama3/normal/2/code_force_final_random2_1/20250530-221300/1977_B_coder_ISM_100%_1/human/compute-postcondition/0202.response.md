Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, nalla is 2, x is an integer equal to the input value, length is either 30 or 31 and must be at least 2, stdin contains t-3 inputs, s is a list of either 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1' if the bit at the corresponding position of x is 1 or '0' if the bit at the corresponding position of x is 0. If the element at index 2 of s is '-1' and the element at index 1 of s is '1', then the element at index 2 of s is '0'.***
