Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `nalla` is 1, `x` is an integer, `length` is 30, stdin contains t-2 inputs, `s` is a list containing 30 strings with '0' at index i, `i` is increased by 1, `flag` is 0 if it was true and the string at index i in s was '0', otherwise its state remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to contain '0' at index `i`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged, except for `flag` which is set to 0 if it was true and the string at index `i` in `s` was '0'. The stdin still contains t-2 inputs.
