Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `nalla` is 1, `x` is an integer, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-2` inputs, `i` is 30, `flag` is 0, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings. Each string in `s` is '1' if the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of the corresponding index is true, otherwise it is '0'.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `flag` has been updated to 0. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `t`, `nalla`, `x`, `length`, `stdin`, `i`, and `s` are still valid.
