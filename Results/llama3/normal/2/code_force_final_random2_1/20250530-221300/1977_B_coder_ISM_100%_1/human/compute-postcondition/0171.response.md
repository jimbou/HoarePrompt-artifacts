Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, nalla is 2, x is an integer equal to the input value, length is 30, stdin contains t-3 inputs, s is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' if the bit at the corresponding position of x is 1 or '0' if the bit at the corresponding position of x is 0. If flag is 0 and s[i] is equal to s[i + 1] and s[i] is '1', then s[i] is '-1' and flag is 1. Otherwise, if flag is 1, then the element at index i of s is '0'. Otherwise, either flag is 0, or the element at index i of s is '1', or s[i] is equal to s[i + 1], or s[i] is '1'.***
