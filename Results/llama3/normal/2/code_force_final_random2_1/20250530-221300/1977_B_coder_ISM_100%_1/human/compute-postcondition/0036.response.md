Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an integer, `length` is 30, `i` is within the range 1 to 29, `s[i]` is '0', stdin contains t-1 inputs. If flag is 1, then flag is 0, otherwise, the value of flag remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `s[i]` has been changed to '0'. The value of `flag` is also updated to 0 if it was previously 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 inputs.
