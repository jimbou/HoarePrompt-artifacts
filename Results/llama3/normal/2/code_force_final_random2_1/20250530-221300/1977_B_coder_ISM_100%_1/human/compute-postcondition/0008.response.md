Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs, `i` is 0. `x` is an integer, if the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, then `s` is a list containing one element '1'. Otherwise, `s` is a list containing a single element '0'.***
