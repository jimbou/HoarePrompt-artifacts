Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `nalla` is 1, `x` is an integer, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-2` inputs, `i` is less than 31, `flag` is either 0 or 1, and `s` is a list containing two strings. The first string in `s` is '1' if the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is true, otherwise it is '0'. The second string in `s` is '1' if the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is true, otherwise it is '0'.***
