Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `nalla` is 2, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `x` is an integer equal to the input value, `i` is 1, and the list `s` contains either '1' if the bit at position `i` of `x` is 1 or '0' if the bit at position `i` of `x` is 0, and '0' is appended to the end of list `s`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. The value of `nalla` remains 2. The value of `length` remains 30. The number of inputs in `stdin` remains `t-3`. The value of `flag` remains either 0 or 1. The value of `x` remains an integer equal to the input value. The value of `i` remains 1. The list `s` still contains either '1' if the bit at position `i` of `x` is 1 or '0' if the bit at position `i` of `x` is 0, but now it also has an additional '0' at the end.
