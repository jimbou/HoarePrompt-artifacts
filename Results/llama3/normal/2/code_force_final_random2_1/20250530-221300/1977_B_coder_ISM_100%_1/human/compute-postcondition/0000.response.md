The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing a single positive integer x (1 <= x < 2^30). Since `t` is assigned the value of the first test case, `t` is now a positive integer (1 <= t < 2^30). The remaining test cases are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 <= t < 2^30), stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing a single positive integer x (1 <= x < 2^30)**
