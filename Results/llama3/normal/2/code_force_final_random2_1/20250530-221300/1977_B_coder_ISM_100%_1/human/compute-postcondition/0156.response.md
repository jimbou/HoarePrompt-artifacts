Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `nalla` is 2, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `x` is an integer equal to the input value, `i` is 2, and the list `s` contains either '1' if the bit at position `i` of `x` is 1 or '0' if the bit at position `i` of `x` is 0. If the bit at position `i` of `x` is 1, '1' is appended to the end of the list `s`. Otherwise, '0' is appended to the end of the list `s`. Additionally, '1' is appended to the end of the list `s` if the bit at position `i` of `x` is 1, otherwise '0' is appended to the end of the list `s`.**
