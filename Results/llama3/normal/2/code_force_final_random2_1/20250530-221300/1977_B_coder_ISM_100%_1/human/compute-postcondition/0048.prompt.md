Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an integer, `s` is a list of 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', `length` is 30, `stdin` contains t-1 inputs, `i` is 29, and `flag` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, nalla is 0, x is an integer, length is 30, stdin contains t-1 inputs, i is within the range 0 to 28. If flag is 0 and s[i] is equal to s[i + 1] and s[i] is '1', then flag is 1, s[i] is '-1', and s[i+1] is '1'. Otherwise, if flag is 1, then s[i] is '0', and either s[i] is not equal to s[i + 1], or s[i] is not '1'. If flag is not 1, then flag is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, nalla is 0, x is an integer, length is 30, stdin contains t-1 inputs, i is within the range 1 to 29. If flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i] is equal to s[i + 1], then s[i] is '-1' and flag is 1. If flag is 1, then flag is 0. If flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', then s[i] is '1' and flag is 0. Otherwise, the values of s[i], flag, and other variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, nalla is 0, x is an integer, length is 30, stdin contains t-1 inputs, i is within the range 2 to 30. If flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i] is equal to s[i+1], then s[i] is '-1' and flag is 1. If flag is true and s[i] is '0', then s[i] is '1' and flag is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
