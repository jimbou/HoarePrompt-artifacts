Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, nalla is 2, x is an integer equal to the input value, length is either 30 or 31, stdin contains t-3 inputs, s is a list of either 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1' if the bit at the corresponding position of x is 1 or '0' if the bit at the corresponding position of x is 0. If flag is 1 and s[29] is '0', then s[29] is '1', otherwise, if flag is 1, then s[29] is '0' and s[30] is '1', and length is 31, otherwise length is 30. In all cases, i is 29.**
