Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer, `s` is a list containing two elements '1' if the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, otherwise `s` is a list containing two elements '0' and '1'**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `nalla`, `length`, `stdin`, and `i` remains the same. The value of `x` also remains the same. However, the list `s` now contains two elements. If the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, then `s` contains two '1's. Otherwise, `s` contains a '0' and a '1'.
