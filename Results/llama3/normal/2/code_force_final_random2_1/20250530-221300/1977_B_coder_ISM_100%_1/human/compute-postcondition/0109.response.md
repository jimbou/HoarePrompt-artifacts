Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, nalla is 1, x is an integer, length is 30, stdin contains t-2 inputs, s is a list containing 30 strings. If flag is true and the string at index i is '0', then the string at index i is updated to '1' and flag is set to 0. If flag is true and the string at index i is not '0' and the string at index i is the same as the string at index i+1 and the string at index i is '1', then s is a list containing 29 strings and one '-1', flag is 1. If flag is true and the string at index i is not '0' and the string at index i is not the same as the string at index i+1 or the string at index i is not '1', then flag is set to 0. If flag is false, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
