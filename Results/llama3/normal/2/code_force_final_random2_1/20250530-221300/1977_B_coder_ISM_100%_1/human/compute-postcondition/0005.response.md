Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an integer, `s` is a list containing one element '1', `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs, `i` is 0. The current value of `x` has a bit set at position `i` (i.e., the binary representation of `x` has a 1 at the `i-th` position).**

In this output state, the list `s` now contains one element '1' which was appended by the code. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `x` still has a bit set at position `i`, and `i` is still 0. The stdin still contains `t-1` inputs.
