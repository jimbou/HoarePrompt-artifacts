Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, nalla is 1, x is an integer, length is either 30 or 31, stdin contains t-2 inputs, s is a list containing either 30 or 31 strings, i is 29. If flag is 1 and s[29] is '0', then length is 31, s[30] is '1', and flag is 1. Otherwise, if flag is 1, then s[29] is '1'. If flag is 0, then flag remains 0.***
