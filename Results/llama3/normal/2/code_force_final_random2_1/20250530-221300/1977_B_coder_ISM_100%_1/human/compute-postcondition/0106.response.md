Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `nalla` is 1, `x` is an integer, `length` is 30, stdin contains `t-2` inputs, `s` is a list containing 30 strings where the string at index `i` is '0', and if `flag` is true, then `flag` is set to 0.**

In this output state, the value of `s[i]` has been updated to '0'. The other variables remain unchanged. The state of `flag` is updated to 0 if it was true before the execution of the code. The rest of the variables and stdin remain the same as in the initial state.
