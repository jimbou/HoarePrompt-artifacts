Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `nalla` is 1, `x` is an integer, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-2` inputs, `i` is 30, `flag` is 0, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings. Each string in `s` is '1' if the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of the corresponding index is true, otherwise it is '0'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, nalla is 1, x is an integer, length is 30, stdin contains t-2 inputs, s is a list containing 30 strings, and i is between 0 and 28 (inclusive). If flag is 0 and s[i] is equal to s[i + 1] and s[i] is '1', then s[i] is updated to '-1' and the rest of the elements in s remain unchanged. Otherwise, if flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', then s[i] is updated to '1' and the rest of the elements in s remain unchanged. In all other cases, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, nalla is 1, x is an integer, length is 30, stdin contains t-2 inputs, s is a list containing 30 strings. If flag is true and the string at index i is '0', then the string at index i is updated to '1' and flag is set to 0. If flag is true and the string at index i is not '0' and the string at index i is the same as the string at index i+1 and the string at index i is '1', then s is a list containing 29 strings and one '-1', flag is 1. If flag is true and the string at index i is not '0' and the string at index i is not the same as the string at index i+1 or the string at index i is not '1', then flag is set to 0. If flag is false, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, nalla is 1, x is an integer, length is 30, stdin contains t-2 inputs, s is a list containing 30 strings, i is increased by 1. If flag is 0, the string at index i in s is equal to the string at index i+1, and the string at index i is '1', then the string at index i in s is updated to '-1' and flag is set to 1. If flag is true and the string at index i in s is '0', then s is updated to contain '1' at index i and flag is set to 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
