Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, nalla is 0, x is an integer, length is 30, stdin contains t-1 inputs, i is within the range 0 to 28. If flag is 1, then s[i] is '0', and either s[i] is not equal to s[i + 1], or s[i] is not '1'. If flag is not 1, then flag is 0.***
