To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `nalla` and `t`.

Since `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t < 2^30), we can conclude that `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

The variable `nalla` is initialized to 0 in the `range(t)` function, so we can set `nalla` to 0.

The state of `stdin` is not directly related to the loop head, so we don't need to adjust it.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `nalla` is 0**
