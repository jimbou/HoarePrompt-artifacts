Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, nalla is 0, x is an integer, length is 30, stdin contains t-1 inputs, i is 29, the current value of flag is 1, and s is a list of 30 elements, each of which is either '1', '0', or '-1', except the last element which is now '1'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t remains the same, nalla is still 0, x is still an integer, the length is still 30, there are still t-1 inputs in stdin, i is still 29, the flag is still 1, and the list s still has 30 elements, but the last element has been changed to '1'.
