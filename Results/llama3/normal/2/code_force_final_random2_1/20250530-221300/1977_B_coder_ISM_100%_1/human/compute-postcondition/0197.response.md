Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `nalla` is 2, `x` is an integer equal to the input value, `length` is either 30 or 31 and must be at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs, `s` is a list of either 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1' if the bit at the corresponding position of `x` is 1 or '0' if the bit at the corresponding position of `x` is 0, `i` is 1. The current value of `s[i]` is '-1' and the current value of `s[i - 1]` is '1'***
