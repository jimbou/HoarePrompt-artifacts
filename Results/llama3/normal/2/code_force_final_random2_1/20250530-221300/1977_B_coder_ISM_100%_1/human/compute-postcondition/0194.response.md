Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, nalla is 2, x is an integer equal to the input value, length is either 30 or 31, stdin contains t-3 inputs, s is a list of either 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1' if the bit at the corresponding position of x is 1 or '0' if the bit at the corresponding position of x is 0, except when flag is 1, then s[29] is '0' and s[30] is '1', i is 29, and flag is either 0 or 1. If flag is 1, then length is 31, otherwise length is 30.***
