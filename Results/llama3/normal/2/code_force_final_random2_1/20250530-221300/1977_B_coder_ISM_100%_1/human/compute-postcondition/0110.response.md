The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 29, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is unknown but it is less than 29. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, nalla is 1, x is an integer, length is 30, stdin contains t-2 inputs, s is a list containing 30 strings, i is increased by 1**
