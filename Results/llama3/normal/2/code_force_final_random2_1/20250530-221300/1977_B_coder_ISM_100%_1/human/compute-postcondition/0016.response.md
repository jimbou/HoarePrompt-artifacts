Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer. If the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, then `s` is a list containing three elements '1'. If the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 0, then `s` is a list containing either '1', '0', and '1' or two '0's and '1', or '1', '0', '0' or three '0's.***
