Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer. If the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, then `s` is a list containing three elements '1'. If the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 0, then `s` is a list containing either '1', '0', and '1' or two '0's and '1'.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by appending '1' to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The length of `s` has increased by 1, and its elements now depend on the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x`.
