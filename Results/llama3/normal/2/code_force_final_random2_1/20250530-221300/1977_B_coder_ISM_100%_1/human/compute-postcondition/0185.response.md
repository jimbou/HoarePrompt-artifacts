Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `nalla` is 2, `x` is an integer equal to the input value, `length` is 30, stdin contains t-3 inputs, `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' if the bit at the corresponding position of `x` is 1 or '0' if the bit at the corresponding position of `x` is 0. If `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` is '0', then the last element of `s` is '1' and `flag` is 0. If `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` is '1', then `s[i]` is now '0'. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is '1' and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i+1]`, then the ith element of `s` is '-1' and the last element of `s` is '1' if the original ith element was '0' and `flag` is 0, otherwise `s` is a list of 30 elements where the ith element is '-1' and the rest of the elements remain unchanged, and `flag` is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, `i` is 29**
