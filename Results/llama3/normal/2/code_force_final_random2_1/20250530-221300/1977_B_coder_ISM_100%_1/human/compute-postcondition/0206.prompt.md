Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, nalla is 2, x is an integer equal to the input value, length is either 30 or 31, stdin contains t-3 inputs, s is a list of either 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1' if the bit at the corresponding position of x is 1 or '0' if the bit at the corresponding position of x is 0. If flag is 1 and s[29] is '0', then s[29] is '1', otherwise, if flag is 1, then s[29] is '0' and s[30] is '1', and length is 31, otherwise length is 30. In all cases, i is 29.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, nalla is 2, x is an integer equal to the input value, length is either 30 or 31 and must be at least 2, stdin contains t-3 inputs, s is a list of either 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1' if the bit at the corresponding position of x is 1 or '0' if the bit at the corresponding position of x is 0. If the second element of s is '-1' and the first element of s is '1', then the second element of s is '-1' and the third element of s is '0', i is 1. Otherwise, s remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, nalla is 2, x is an integer equal to the input value, length is either 30 or 31 and must be at least 2, stdin contains t-3 inputs, s is a list of either 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1' if the bit at the corresponding position of x is 1 or '0' if the bit at the corresponding position of x is 0. If the element at index 2 of s is '-1' and the element at index 1 of s is '1', then the element at index 2 of s is '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `nalla` is 2, `x` is an integer equal to the input value, `length` is either 30 or 31 and must be at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs, `s` is a list of either 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1' if the bit at the corresponding position of `x` is 1 or '0' if the bit at the corresponding position of `x` is 0. If the element at index 2 of `s` is '-1' and the element at index 1 of `s` is '1', then the element at index 2 of `s` is '0' and the element at index 1 of `s` is '-1'. Otherwise, the state of `s` remains unchanged. `i` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
