Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an integer, `length` is either 30 or 31 and must be greater than 3, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs, `i` is 3, `flag` is either 0 or 1, and `s` is a list of either 30 or 31 elements, where if `s[3]` was originally '-1' and `s[2]` was '1', then `s[3]` is now '0' and `s[2]` is now '-1'. Otherwise, the values of `s[3]` and `s[2]` remain unchanged. The remaining elements of `s` are either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `flag` is 1, then either the last element of `s` is '1' or `length` is 31, `s[29]` is '0' and `s[30]` is '1'.**
