Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `nalla` is 1, `x` is an integer, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-2` inputs, `i` is less than 30, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s` is a list containing one element '0', and the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. The value of `nalla` remains 1. The value of `x` remains an integer. The value of `length` remains 30. The stdin still contains `t-2` inputs. The value of `i` remains less than 30. The value of `flag` remains either 0 or 1. The list `s` now contains one element '0'. The bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i` remains 0.
