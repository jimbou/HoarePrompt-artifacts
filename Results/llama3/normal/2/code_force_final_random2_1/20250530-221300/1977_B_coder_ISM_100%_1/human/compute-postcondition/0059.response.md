Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, nalla is 0, x is an integer, length is either 30 or 31 and must be at least 2, stdin contains t-1 inputs, i is 1, flag is either 0 or 1, and s is a list of either 30 or 31 elements, each of which is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If flag is 1, then either the last element of s is '1' or length is 31, s[29] is '0' and s[30] is '1'. If s[i] is '-1' and s[i - 1] is '1', then the current value of s[i] is '0' and the current value of s[i - 1] is '-1'. Otherwise, the values of s[i] and s[i - 1] remain unchanged.***
