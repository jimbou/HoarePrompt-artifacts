Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `nalla` is 2, `x` is an integer equal to the input value, `length` is 30, stdin contains t-3 inputs, `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' if the bit at the corresponding position of `x` is 1 or '0' if the bit at the corresponding position of `x` is 0, but `s[i]` is now '0', and if `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` is '0', then the last element of `s` is '1' and `flag` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `nalla` is still 2, `x` is still an integer equal to the input value, and `length` is still 30. The number of inputs in stdin remains t-3. The list `s` still has 30 elements, but the element at index `i` is now '0'. If `flag` is 1 and the element at index `i` is '0', then the last element of `s` is '1' and `flag` is 0.
