Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, nalla is 0, x is an integer, s is an empty list, length is 30, stdin contains t-1 inputs.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(30):
    if x & pow(2, i):
        s.append('1')
    else:
        s.append('0')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs, `i` is 0. `x` is an integer, if the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, then `s` is a list containing one element '1'. Otherwise, `s` is a list containing a single element '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer. If the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, then `s` is a list containing two elements '1'. If the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 0, then `s` is a list containing either '1' and '0' or two '0's.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer. If the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, then `s` is a list containing three elements '1'. If the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 0, then `s` is a list containing either '1', '0', and '1' or two '0's and '1', or '1', '0', '0' or three '0's.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
