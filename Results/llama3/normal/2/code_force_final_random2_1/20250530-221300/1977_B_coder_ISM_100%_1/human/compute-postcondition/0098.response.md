Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, nalla is 1, x is an integer, length is 30, stdin contains t-2 inputs, s is a list containing 30 strings, and i is between 0 and 28 (inclusive). Either flag is not 1, or s[i] is not '0'. If flag is not 1 and s[i] is '0', then s[i] remains '0' and the rest of the elements in s remain unchanged. Additionally, either flag is not 0, or s[i] is not equal to s[i + 1], or s[i] is not '1'.***
