Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, nalla is 1, x is an integer, length is 30, stdin contains t-2 inputs, s is a list containing 30 strings, and i is between 0 and 28 (inclusive). The current value of flag is 0, the current value of s[i] is '1', and the current value of s[i + 1] is also '1'. If flag was 1 and s[i] was '0' before, then s[i] has been updated to '1' and the rest of the elements in s remain unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
