Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, nalla is 0, x is an integer, length is 30, stdin contains t-1 inputs, i is within the range 1 to 29, s[i] is '-1', flag is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `s[i]` has been updated to '-1' due to the first line of the code. The second line sets the value of `flag` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
