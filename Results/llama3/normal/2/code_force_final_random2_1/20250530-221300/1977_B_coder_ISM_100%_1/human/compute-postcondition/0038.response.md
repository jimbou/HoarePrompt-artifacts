Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, nalla is 0, x is an integer, length is 30, stdin contains t-1 inputs, i is within the range 1 to 29. If flag is 1, then flag is 0. If flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', then s[i] is '1' and flag is 0. Otherwise, the values of s[i], flag, and other variables remain unchanged.***
