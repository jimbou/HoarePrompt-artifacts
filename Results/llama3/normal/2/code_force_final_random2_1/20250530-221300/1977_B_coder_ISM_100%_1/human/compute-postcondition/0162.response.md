Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, nalla is 2, x is an integer equal to the input value, length is 30, stdin contains t-3 inputs, s is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' if the bit at the corresponding position of x is 1 or '0' if the bit at the corresponding position of x is 0, i is 0, and flag is 0. If flag is true and the element at index i of s is '0', then the element at index i of s is updated to '1'.***
