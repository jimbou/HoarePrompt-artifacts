Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `nalla` is 1, `x` is an integer, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-2` inputs, `i` is less than 30, `flag` is either 0 or 1, and `s` is an empty list. The current value of `x` has a bit set at position `i` (i.e., `x` & `2^i` is true).***
