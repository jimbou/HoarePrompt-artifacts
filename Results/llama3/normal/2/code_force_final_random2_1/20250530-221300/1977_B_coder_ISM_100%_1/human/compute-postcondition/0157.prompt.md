Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, nalla is 2, x is an integer equal to the input value, length is 30, stdin contains t-3 inputs, s is an empty list, i is either 30 or 31, flag is either 0 or 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(30):
    if x & pow(2, i):
        s.append('1')
    else:
        s.append('0')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `nalla` is 2, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `x` is an integer equal to the input value, and `i` is 0. The list `s` contains either '1' if the bit at position `i` of `x` is 1 or '0' if the bit at position `i` of `x` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `nalla` is 2, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `x` is an integer equal to the input value, `i` is 1, and the list `s` contains either '1' if the bit at position `i` of `x` is 1 or '0' if the bit at position `i` of `x` is 0. If the bit at position `i` of `x` is 1, '1' is appended to the end of the list `s`. Otherwise, '0' is appended to the end of the list `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `nalla` is 2, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `x` is an integer equal to the input value, `i` is 2, and the list `s` contains either '1' if the bit at position `i` of `x` is 1 or '0' if the bit at position `i` of `x` is 0. If the bit at position `i` of `x` is 1, '1' is appended to the end of the list `s`. Otherwise, '0' is appended to the end of the list `s`. Additionally, '1' is appended to the end of the list `s` if the bit at position `i` of `x` is 1, otherwise '0' is appended to the end of the list `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
