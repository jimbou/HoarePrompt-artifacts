The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 30, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer, if the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, then `s` is a list containing one element '1'. Otherwise, `s` is a list containing a single element '0'.**
