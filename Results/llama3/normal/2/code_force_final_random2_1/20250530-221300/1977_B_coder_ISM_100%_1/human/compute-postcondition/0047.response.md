Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, nalla is 0, x is an integer, length is 30, stdin contains t-1 inputs, i is within the range 2 to 30. If flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i] is equal to s[i+1], then s[i] is '-1' and flag is 1. If flag is true and s[i] is '0', then s[i] is '1' and flag is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
