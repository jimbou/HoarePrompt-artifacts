Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, nalla is 2, x is an integer equal to the input value, length is 30, stdin contains t-3 inputs, s is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' if the bit at the corresponding position of x is 1 or '0' if the bit at the corresponding position of x is 0, i is 30, and flag is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, nalla is 2, x is an integer equal to the input value, length is 30, stdin contains t-3 inputs, s is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' if the bit at the corresponding position of x is 1 or '0' if the bit at the corresponding position of x is 0. If flag is 0 and s[i] is equal to s[i + 1] and s[i] is '1', then s[i] is '-1' and flag is 1. Otherwise, if flag is 1, then the element at index i of s is '0'. Otherwise, either flag is 0, or the element at index i of s is '1', or s[i] is equal to s[i + 1], or s[i] is '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, nalla is 2, x is an integer equal to the input value, length is 30, stdin contains t-3 inputs, s is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' if the bit at the corresponding position of x is 1 or '0' if the bit at the corresponding position of x is 0. If flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', then the last element of s is '1' and flag is 0. If flag is 1 and s[i] is '1', then s[i] is now '0'. If flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i] is equal to s[i+1], then the ith element of s is '-1' and the last element of s is '1' if the original ith element was '0' and flag is 0, otherwise s is a list of 30 elements where the ith element is '-1' and the rest of the elements remain unchanged, and flag is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, nalla is 2, x is an integer equal to the input value, length is 30, stdin contains t-3 inputs, s is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' if the bit at the corresponding position of x is 1 or '0' if the bit at the corresponding position of x is 0. If flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', then the last element of s is '1' and flag is 0. If flag is 1 and s[i] is '1', then s[i] is now '0'. If flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i] is equal to s[i+1], then the ith element of s is '-1' and the last element of s is '1' if the original ith element was '0' and flag is 0, otherwise s is a list of 30 elements where the ith element is '-1' and the rest of the elements remain unchanged, and flag is 1. If flag is 0 and s[i] is not equal to s[i+1] and s[i] is '1', then the 29th element of s is '-1' and flag is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, i is 29.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
