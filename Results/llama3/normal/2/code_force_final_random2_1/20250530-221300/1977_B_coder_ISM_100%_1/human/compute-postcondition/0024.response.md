Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, nalla is 0, x is an integer, length is 30, stdin contains t-1 inputs, i is within the range 0 to 28, flag is 1, s[i] is '-1', and s[i+1] is '1'.**

In this final state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code. The value of `nalla` also remains 0, as it was not affected by the code. The value of `x` is still an integer, but its specific value is not changed by the code. The value of `length` is still 30, as it was not modified. The number of inputs in stdin remains t-1, as no inputs were read or modified. The value of `i` is still within the range 0 to 28, as it was not changed. The value of `flag` is now 1, as it was assigned the value 1 by the code. The value of `s[i]` is now '-1', as it was assigned this value by the code. The value of `s[i+1]` remains '1', as it was not modified by the code.
