Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer. If the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, then `s` is a list containing two elements '1'. If the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 0, then `s` is a list containing either '1' and '0' or two '0's.***
